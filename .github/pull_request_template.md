## External Release Notes

Please provide a description that allows an external user to understand the changes made, even without access to the original pull request.

If this is an internal-only change, add the `internal` label to omit the changes from the external release notes. 

Is this a cool new feature we should curate for our users? Add the `highlight` label.
