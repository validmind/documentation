Model Risk Management (MRM) is a crucial process for organizations using mathematical and statistical models to inform decision-making. MRM aims to identify, assess, and mitigate risks arising from model usage, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of model outputs. A key aspect of MRM is its three lines of defense, which provide a structured approach to managing model risk across various functions and roles.

## First Line of Defense: Business Units

Model Development:

- Business units are responsible for creating models that accurately represent the underlying systems or processes. This involves selecting appropriate variables, data sources, and mathematical or statistical methods, as well as performing rigorous documentation and testing, including sensitivity analysis and stress testing. Ensuring that models are conceptually sound and robust is crucial to minimize model risk.

Model Validation:

- Business units also play a role in the validation process, collaborating with independent validation teams to ensure that models are fit for their intended purpose. This involves reviewing the model's assumptions, methodologies, and data quality, as well as assessing the model's predictive accuracy and stability. Validation provides assurance that the model's assumptions and methodologies are appropriate and that the model is fit for its intended use.

Model Implementation:
- Business units are responsible for integrating models into the organization's systems and processes. Proper implementation ensures that the model is used consistently and accurately, with adequate controls and documentation in place. Model users must be trained to ensure they understand the model's purpose, limitations, and assumptions.

## Second Line of Defense: Model Risk Oversight Function

The second line of defense is an independent model risk oversight function that provides a governance framework and guidance for model risk management. This function is responsible for:

- Developing and maintaining MRM policies and procedures that align with regulatory requirements and industry best practices.
- Ensuring that model development, validation, and implementation processes adhere to the established MRM framework.
- Periodically reviewing and assessing the organization's model inventory and associated risks.
- Providing guidance and support to business units in managing model risks, including the identification of emerging risks and the implementation of risk mitigation measures.

## Third Line of Defense: Internal Audit Function

The internal audit function serves as the third line of defense in MRM, assessing the effectiveness of MRM practices and controls. Key responsibilities of the internal audit function include:

- Evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of the MRM framework, including the first and second lines of defense.
- Assessing the organization's compliance with MRM policies, procedures, and regulatory requirements.
- Identifying gaps or weaknesses in MRM practices and recommending improvements.
- Providing assurance to senior management and the board of directors that the organization's MRM practices are effective in managing model risks.
