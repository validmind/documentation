If necessary, ask a network administrator to add these domains to your firewall allowlist (whitelist). 

If your company has strict security requirements and requires you to connect via VPN or AWS PrivateLink, please contact your IT/InfoSec team. For additional help setting up a VPN or PrivateLink with ValidMind's MRM platform please visit [configure AWS PrivateLink](configure-aws-privatelink.qmd) or send an email to <support@validmind.ai>.
