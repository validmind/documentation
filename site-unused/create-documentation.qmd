Upload documentation and test results for a specific model, to review and validate models, and to prepare validation reports. 

## Prerequisites

- You hold the `Developer` or `Validator` role
- The model you are documenting is [registered in the model inventory](register-models-in-model-inventory.qmd).

## Steps

1. [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_url >}}).
   
2. On the **Documentation Projects** page, click **Create new project**.
   
3. Select the relevant details in the form:

   - Select the relevant model 
   - Select the relevant type of documentation you are looking to generate 
   - Enter a name for the project 

4. Click **Create Project**.

::: {.callout-tip}
The documentation template is automatically applied based on the selected model details and documentation requirements configured by an administrator, such as your model risk management team.
:::

ValidMind has now created an empty documentation project associated with the model. You can access this project from the UI on the **Documentation Projects** page or by navigating to the relevant model details page in the **Model Inventory** page.

5. Locating the project identifier, API key and secret:
   
   On the **Getting started** page of the newly created project, you can find the initialization code that enables the client library to associate documentation and tests with the appropriate project. The initialization code configures the following arguments: 

- `api_host`: The location of the ValidMind API
- `api_key`: The account API key
- `api_secret`: The account secret key
- `project`: The project identifier

The code snippet can be copied and pasted directly into your developer source code to integrate the {{< var vm_framework >}} and to be able to upload to the ValidMind Platform.
