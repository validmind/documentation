A typical high-level model lifecycle workflow looks like this:

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[New model<br>registration] --> B[Initial<br>validation]
    B --> C[Validation<br>approval]
    C --> D[In production]
    D --> E[Periodic review<br>and revalidation]
    E --> B
```
<br>

New model registration
: Model owners and validators use the model inventory to manage all metadata associated with a model, including compliance and regulatory attributes. Users select a documentation template when registering a new inventory model.

**Initial validation**
: Triggers a new documentation workflow, resulting in a model that is ready for production deployment after its documentation and validation reports are approved. 

See [Track the documentation workflow](#tracking-the-documentation-workflow) for more details.

**Validation approval**
: Perform validation of the model to ascertain that it meets the needs for which it was designed. ValidMind can connect to third-party systems to send events when a model has been approved for production.

**In production**
: Use the model in production while ensuring its ongoing reliability, accuracy, and compliance with regulations by monitoring the model's performance.

**Periodic review and revalidation**
: As part of regular performance monitoring or change management, developers and validators follow a process similar to that seen in the **Initial validation** step.
