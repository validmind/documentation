This article provides an example of how to run a Test Plan to validate a tabular dataset, and provides a reference to other dataset tests and test plans available in the Developer Framework. 

## Prerequisites:

* The model is already [registered in the model inventory](register-models-in-model-inventory.qmd)
* There is an active documentation project for the model
* You have already located the project identifier, API key and secret
* You have already installed the ValidMind client library in your developer environment
* You are logged into the ValidMind Platform

## Examples

Please refer to the following notebooks for examples of how to run dataset test plans:
