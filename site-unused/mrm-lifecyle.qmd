Model Risk Management (MRM) plays an important role in ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and effectiveness of models used in decision-making processes. This article focuses on the model lifecycle and process workflow, outlining the key stages and activities that constitute a robust MRM framework.

## Model Lifecycle Stages

### Model Design and Development

At this stage, subject matter experts identify the problem, define the model's objectives, and design a model that accurately represents the underlying system or process. This involves selecting appropriate variables, data sources, and mathematical or statistical methods. Rigorous documentation and testing, including sensitivity analysis and stress testing, are crucial to ensure model soundness.

### Model Validation

An independent team evaluates the model's conceptual soundness, performance, and compliance with regulatory requirements. This step involves reviewing the model's assumptions, methodologies, and data quality, as well as assessing the model's predictive accuracy and stability. Validation provides assurance that the model is fit for its intended use.

### Model Implementation

After validation, the model is integrated into the organization's systems and processes. Proper implementation ensures that the model is used consistently and accurately, with adequate controls and documentation in place. Model users must be trained to ensure they understand the model's purpose, limitations, and assumptions.

### Model Monitoring and Performance Evaluation

Ongoing monitoring of model performance, assumptions, and limitations is essential to maintain model accuracy and reliability. Regular model performance evaluations help identify potential issues and trigger model updates or recalibrations when necessary. This stage also includes monitoring regulatory changes that may impact the model's compliance status.

### Model Maintenance and Retirement

Model maintenance involves periodic updates and recalibrations to address changing conditions or identified issues. When a model is no longer relevant or effective, it must be retired and replaced with a more suitable model. Proper documentation and archiving of retired models are essential for regulatory and audit purposes.
