## Next steps

You can look at the output produced by the ValidMind Developer Framework right in the notebook where you ran the code, as you would expect. But there is a better way: use the ValidMind platform to work with your model documentation.

### Work with your model documentation

1. From the [**Model Inventory**](https://app.prod.validmind.ai/model-inventory) in the ValidMind Platform UI, go to the model you registered earlier.

2. Click and expand the **Model Development** section.

What you see is the full draft of your model documentation in a more easily consumable version. From here, you can make qualitative edits to model documentation, view guidelines, collaborate with validators, and submit your model documentation for approval when it's ready.
