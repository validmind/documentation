The **Document Checker** helps ensure that model documentation aligns with relevant regulatory requirements. This feature, powered by ValidMind's LLM capabilities, allows users to run a compliance check against specific regulations by selecting the appropriate framework before review.

Document checks are essential for maintaining compliance and avoiding regulatory risk. They support teams by flagging missing or incomplete areas of documentation and help ensure consistency and accountability throughout the model development lifecycle.

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] You must have permission to edit or submit model documentation
- [x] The model documentation must already be uploaded and structured in a supported format (e.g., Word, PDF, or Quarto)
- [x] Access to LLM features enabled in your workspace (check with your admin)

:::

## Steps

1. **Navigate to the Document Checker**
   - From the project dashboard, go to the model you're reviewing.
   - Click on the **Document Checker** tab in the left-hand menu.

2. **Select a regulation**
   - Use the dropdown menu labeled **“Check against regulation”** to choose the appropriate framework (e.g., SR 11-7, OCC 2011-12, etc.)
   - The selected regulation will determine the criteria used to evaluate the documentation.

3. **Run the check**
   - Click **"Start Check"** to initiate the document review.
   - The system will analyze the uploaded documentation and display flagged sections that do not meet the selected regulatory requirements.
   - Each issue will be labeled by severity and include a suggestion or reference.

4. **Review and address flagged items**
   - Click on a flagged issue to view the related section in context.
   - Revise the documentation directly or leave a comment for your team.
   - Optionally, re-run the check after making changes.

## Troubleshooting

- **The regulation list is empty**  
  → Ensure LLM features are enabled in your workspace and you have the required role.

- **Check fails to start**  
  → Confirm that your document is uploaded and meets the supported file format.

- **Results seem incomplete or irrelevant**  
  → Make sure the correct regulation is selected. If the document uses non-standard formatting or terminology, consider aligning with ValidMind’s template recommendations.

## What's next

Once your document is aligned with regulatory requirements:
- Submit the documentation for final approval.
- Explore [Model Validation tasks](/validation/overview.html) to continue the governance process.
- Learn more about [how LLM features work](https://docs.validmind.com/about/overview-llm-features.html) and how to customize the prompt or use optional risk assessment questions.
