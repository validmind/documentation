The **Document Checker** helps ensure that your model documentation aligns with the relevant regulatory requirements of your choice. Powered by {{< var vm.product >}}’s LLM capabilities, this feature allows you to run a compliance check by selecting a Regulatory requirement before review.

Document checks are essential for maintaining compliance and avoiding regulatory risk. They support teams by flagging missing or incomplete areas in documentation and help promote consistency and accountability throughout the model development lifecycle.

## Steps

1. **Navigate to the Document Checker**
   - From the homepage dashboard, select **Inventory** in the left-hand menu.
   - Click the model you'd like to check.
   - In the left-hand menu, select **Documentation**.
   - On the documentation page, click the **Document Checker** tab on the right.

2. **Select a regulation**
   - Use the **Select a regulation** dropdown to choose the regulation you'd like to check against (e.g., SR 11-7, E-23, SS1-23).
   - The Document Checker will use this regulation to evaluate your model’s documentation.

3. **Run the check**
   - A pop-up with a list of regulation-based questions will appear.
   - Scroll to the bottom and click **Check Document**.
   - The system will analyze your documentation and automatically answer the questions using its content.
   - Click **Expand All** to quickly scan through the findings.

4. **Review and address flagged items**
   - Each question includes:
     - A **Finding** – highlighting what’s missing or unclear
     - A **Recommendation** – providing guidance on what to add or revise
   - Use the feedback to identify the appropriate sections of your documentation and fill in the gaps.
