## Introduction & conventions

::: {.callout}
Single-sourcing information in the docs site makes use of [Quartoâ€™s Includes functionality](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/includes.html).
:::

- Single-sourced information should live in the same directory as the original file it was extracted from.
- Single-source files should always be prefixed with an underscore, and more or less follow the [same naming conventions as our style guide](https://docs.validmind.ai/about/contributing/style-guide/conventions.html#filenames): 
    - e.g. `_collaborate-with-others-comments.qmd`
- Single-source files do not need a YAML header, and should not contain footnotes
    - Single-source files are the only place where instructional inline links are preferred
