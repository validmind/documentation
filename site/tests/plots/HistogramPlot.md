# HistogramPlot

Generates customizable histogram plots for numerical features in a dataset using Plotly.

### Purpose

This test provides a flexible way to visualize the distribution of numerical features in a dataset.
It allows for extensive customization of the histogram appearance and behavior through parameters,
making it suitable for various exploratory data analysis tasks.

### Test Mechanism

The test creates histogram plots for specified numerical columns (or all numerical columns if none specified).
It supports various customization options including:
- Number of bins or bin edges
- Color and opacity
- Kernel density estimation overlay
- Logarithmic scaling
- Normalization options
- Configurable subplot layout (columns and spacing)

### Signs of High Risk

- Highly skewed distributions that may indicate data quality issues
- Unexpected bimodal or multimodal distributions
- Presence of extreme outliers
- Empty or sparse distributions

### Strengths

- Highly customizable visualization options
- Interactive Plotly plots with zoom, pan, and hover capabilities
- Supports both single and multiple column analysis
- Provides insights into data distribution patterns
- Can handle different data types and scales
- Configurable subplot layout for better visualization

### Limitations

- Limited to numerical features only
- Visual interpretation may be subjective
- May not be suitable for high-dimensional datasets
- Performance may degrade with very large datasets
