# TimeSeriesDescriptiveStatistics

Evaluates the descriptive statistics of a time series dataset to identify trends, patterns, and data quality issues.

### Purpose

The purpose of the TimeSeriesDescriptiveStatistics function is to analyze an individual time series by providing a
summary of key descriptive statistics. This analysis helps in understanding trends, patterns, and data quality
issues within the time series dataset.

### Test Mechanism

The function extracts the time series data and provides a summary of key descriptive statistics. The dataset is
expected to have a datetime index, and the function will check this and raise an error if the index is not in a
datetime format. For each variable (column) in the dataset, appropriate statistics, including start date, end date,
min, mean, max, skewness, kurtosis, and count, are calculated.

### Signs of High Risk

- If the index of the dataset is not in datetime format, it could lead to errors in time-series analysis.
- Inconsistent or missing data within the dataset might affect the analysis of trends and patterns.

### Strengths

- Provides a comprehensive summary of key descriptive statistics for each variable.
- Helps identify data quality issues and understand the distribution of the data.

### Limitations

- Assumes the dataset is provided as a DataFrameDataset object with a .df attribute to access the pandas DataFrame.
- Only analyzes datasets with a datetime index and will raise an error for other types of indices.
- Does not handle large datasets efficiently, and performance may degrade with very large datasets.
