# DefaultRatesbyRiskBandPlot

Generates a bar plot showcasing the distribution of default rates across different risk bands in a dataset.

**Purpose**:
The Default Rates by Risk Band Plot metric aims to quantify and visually represent default rates across varying
risk bands within a specific dataset. This information is essential in evaluating the functionality of credit risk
models, by providing a comprehensive view of default rates across a range of risk categories.

**Test Mechanism**:
The applied test approach involves a calculated bar plot. This plot is derived by initially determining the count
of accounts in every risk band and then converting these count values into percentages by dividing by the total
quantity of accounts. The percentages are then depicted as a bar plot, clearly showcasing the proportion of total
accounts associated with each risk band. Hence, the plot delivers a summarized depiction of default risk across
various bands. The 'Dark24' color sequence is used in the plot to ensure each risk band is easily distinguishable.

**Signs of High Risk**:
- High risk may be indicated by a significantly large percentage of accounts associated with high-risk bands.
- High exposure to potential default risk in the dataset indicates potential weaknesses in the model's capability
to effectively manage or predict credit risk.

**Strengths**:
- The metric's primary strengths lie in its simplicity and visual impact.
- The graphical display of default rates allows for a clear understanding of the spread of default risk across risk
bands.
- Using a bar chart simplifies the comparison between various risk bands and can highlight potential spots of high
risk.
- This approach assists in identifying any numerical imbalances or anomalies, thus facilitating the task of
evaluating and contrasting performance across various credit risk models.

**Limitations**:
- The key constraint of this metric is that it cannot provide any insights as to why certain risk bands might have
higher default rates than others.
- If there is a large imbalance in the number of accounts across risk bands, the visual representation might not
accurately depict the true distribution of risk.
- Other factors contributing to credit risk beyond the risk bands are not considered.
- The metric's reliance on a visual format might potentially lead to misinterpretation of results, as graphical
depictions can sometimes be misleading.
