# DatasetMetadata

Collects and logs essential metadata of training datasets for transparency in model validation.

**Purpose**: The `DatasetMetadata` test is primarily aimed at collecting and logging essential descriptive
statistics related to the training datasets. This test generates essential metadata such as the types of tasks
(classification, regression, text_classification, text_summarization) and tags (tabular_data, time_series_data,
text_data) associated with the datasets. This transparency facilitates model validation by linking different
metrics and test results to the originating dataset.

**Test Mechanism**: Rather than conducting a test or implementing a grading scale, this class collects and logs
dataset metadata. During post-initialization, the metadata is linked to the dataset object. The `run` method
produces a `TestSuiteDatasetResult` object, which is assigned a unique ID and is bound to a dataset. The dataset
metadata is associated with this ID for use in future, more focused, validation procedures.

**Signs of High Risk**:
- The metadata is incomplete or incorrect which can lead to inaccuracies in model risk assessment.
- Dataset labels or types are missing, leading to issues in further model validation or mispresentations.

**Strengths**:
- The class brings transparency to model validation exercises by providing detailed information about the dataset.
- It assists in error diagnosis and behaviors correlation to the model.
- Ensures the correctness of tasks and data types associations and allows superior model explanations.
- Supports dataset versioning by logging each dataset's metadata, maintaining a trackable history of alterations.

**Limitations**:
- The `DatasetMetadata` class's completeness and accuracy might be questionable, especially if metadata isn't
appropriately added or is inaccurate.
- It doesn't involve the evaluation of the dataset's quality or the direct validation of model predictions, hence
it should be combined with other tests for a more comprehensive assessment.
- The class cannot detect potential bias in the dataset. For bias detection, separate tests specifically tailored
towards fairness and bias detection would be necessary.
