# DatasetDescription

Provides comprehensive descriptive statistics and histograms for each field in a dataset, aiding in data
understanding and anomaly detection.

**Purpose**: This metric, known as DatasetDescription, has been architected to furnish an extensive spectrum of
descriptive statistics pertinent to the input data that fuels a machine learning model. The statistics generated by
this metric include measures of central tendency, dispersion, in addition to frequency counts for each field, or
variable, in the dataset. The purpose of these statistics lies in comprehending the nature of the data, identifying
anomalies, and grasping the extent to which the data fulfills model assumptions.

**Test Mechanism**: The testing function commences by morphing the input dataset back to its primary form by
undoing any one-hot encoding, subsequently extracting each field from the dataset. Post this process, the script
computes the descriptive statistics for each field, contingent on its data type (Numeric, Categorical, Boolean,
Dummy, Text, Null). For numeric fields, the statistics include computations of mean, standard deviation, minimum,
maximum, and varying percentiles. For categorical and boolean fields, the frequency counts of each category along
with the most frequent category (or 'top') are computed. The script computes missing and distinct values for all
fields, while also generating histograms for numeric and categorical types, as well as word count histograms for
text - accomplished through counting the number of occurrences of each unique word.

**Signs of High Risk**:
- A significant portion of missing or null values, which may hinder the model's performance.
- Predominance of a single value (indicating low diversity) within a feature.
- High variance in a numeric feature.
- High number of distinct categories in categorical features.
- High frequency of a specific word in text data as this might signal bias in the dataset.

**Strengths**:
- Capability to provide an all-inclusive, general summary of the dataset.
- It helps to understand the distribution, dispersion, and central tendency of numeric features, moreover, the
frequency distribution within categorical and text features.
- It can efficaciously handle different data types, offering insights into the variety and distribution of field
values.

**Limitations**:
- It does not provide insights regarding the relationships between different fields or features, as it focuses only
on univariate analysis.
- The statistical description for text data is severely limited, given it essentially forms a bag-of-words model.
- The descriptive statistics generated, including mean and standard deviation, hold no meaningful value for ordinal
categorical data.
- This metric does not offer intelligence on how the derived data will influence the performance of the model.
