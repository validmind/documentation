# Toxicity

Assesses the toxicity of text data within a dataset to visualize the distribution of toxicity scores.

### Purpose

The Toxicity test aims to evaluate the level of toxic content present in a text dataset by leveraging a pre-trained
toxicity model. It helps in identifying potentially harmful or offensive language that may negatively impact users
or stakeholders.

### Test Mechanism

This test uses a pre-trained toxicity evaluation model and applies it to each text entry in the specified column of
a datasetâ€™s dataframe. The procedure involves:

- Loading a pre-trained toxicity model.
- Extracting the text from the specified column in the dataset.
- Computing toxicity scores for each text entry.
- Generating a KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) plot to visualize the distribution of these toxicity scores.

### Signs of High Risk

- High concentration of high toxicity scores in the KDE plot.
- A significant proportion of text entries with toxicity scores above a predefined threshold.
- Wide distribution of toxicity scores, indicating inconsistency in content quality.

### Strengths

- Provides a visual representation of toxicity distribution, making it easier to identify outliers.
- Uses a robust pre-trained model for toxicity evaluation.
- Can process large text datasets efficiently.

### Limitations

- Depends on the accuracy and bias of the pre-trained toxicity model.
- Does not provide context-specific insights, which may be necessary for nuanced understanding.
- May not capture all forms of subtle or indirect toxic language.
