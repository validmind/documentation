# TextDescription

Performs comprehensive textual analysis on a dataset using NLTK, evaluating various parameters and generating
visualizations.

**Purpose**: This test uses the TextDescription metric to conduct a comprehensive textual analysis of a given
dataset. Various parameters such as total words, total sentences, average sentence length, total paragraphs, total
unique words, most common words, total punctuations, and lexical diversity are evaluated. This metric aids in
comprehending the nature of the text and evaluating the potential challenges that machine learning algorithms
deployed for textual analysis, language processing, or summarization might face.

**Test Mechanism**: The test works by parsing the given dataset and utilizes the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
library for tokenizing the text into words, sentences, and paragraphs. Subsequently, it processes the text further
by eliminating stopwords declared in 'unwanted_tokens' and punctuations. Next, it determines parameters like the
total count of words, sentences, paragraphs, punctuations alongside the average sentence length and lexical
diversity. Lastly, the result from these calculations is condensed and scatter plots for certain variable
combinations (e.g. Total Words vs Total Sentences, Total Words vs Total Unique Words) are produced, providing a
visual representation of the text's structure.

**Signs of High Risk**:
- Anomalies or an increase in complexity within the lexical diversity results.
- Longer sentences and paragraphs.
- High uniqueness of words.
- Presence of a significant amount of unwanted tokens.
- Missing or erroneous visualizations.
These signs suggest potential risk in text processing ML models, indicating that the ability of the model to
absorb and process text could be compromised.

**Strengths**:
- An essential pre-processing tool, specifically for textual analysis in machine learning model data.
- Provides a comprehensive breakdown of a text dataset, which aids in understanding both structural and vocabulary
complexity.
- Generates visualizations of correlations between chosen variables to further comprehend the text's structure and
complexity.

**Limitations**:
- Heavy reliance on the NLTK library, restricting its use to only the languages that NLTK supports.
- Limited customization capacity as the undesirable tokens and stop words are predefined.
- Lacks the ability to consider semantics or grammatical complexities, which could be crucial aspects in language
processing.
- Assumes that the document is well-structured (includes sentences and paragraphs); therefore, unstructured or
poorly formatted text may distort the results.
