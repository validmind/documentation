# Sentiment

Analyzes the sentiment of text data within a dataset using the VADER sentiment analysis tool.

### Purpose

The Sentiment test evaluates the overall sentiment of text data within a dataset. By analyzing sentiment scores, it
aims to ensure that the model is interpreting text data accurately and is not biased towards a particular sentiment.

### Test Mechanism

This test uses the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) SentimentIntensityAnalyzer. It processes
each text entry in a specified column of the dataset to calculate the compound sentiment score, which represents
the overall sentiment polarity. The distribution of these sentiment scores is then visualized using a KDE (Kernel
Density Estimation) plot, highlighting any skewness or concentration in sentiment.

### Signs of High Risk

- Extreme polarity in sentiment scores, indicating potential bias.
- Unusual concentration of sentiment scores in a specific range.
- Significant deviation from expected sentiment distribution for the given text data.

### Strengths

- Provides a clear visual representation of sentiment distribution.
- Uses a well-established sentiment analysis tool (VADER).
- Can handle a wide range of text data, making it flexible for various applications.

### Limitations

- May not capture nuanced or context-specific sentiments.
- Relies heavily on the accuracy of the VADER sentiment analysis tool.
- Visualization alone may not provide comprehensive insights into underlying causes of sentiment distribution.
