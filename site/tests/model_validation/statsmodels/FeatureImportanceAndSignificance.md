# FeatureImportanceAndSignificance

Evaluates and visualizes the statistical significance and feature importance using regression and decision tree
models.

**Purpose**: The 'FeatureImportanceAndSignificance' test evaluates the statistical significance and the importance
of features in the context of the machine learning model. By comparing the p-values from a regression model and the
feature importances from a decision tree model, this test aids in determining the most significant variables from a
statistical and a machine learning perspective, assisting in feature selection during the model development process.

**Test Mechanism**: The test first compares the p-values from a regression model and the feature importances from a
decision tree model. These values are normalized to ensure a uniform comparison. The 'p_threshold' parameter is
used to determine what p-value is considered statistically significant and if the 'significant_only' parameter is
true, only features with p-values below this threshold are included in the final output. The output from this test
includes an interactive visualization displaying normalized p-values and the associated feature importances. The
test throws an error if it does not receive both a regression model and a decision tree model.

**Signs of High Risk**:
- Exceptionally high or low p-values, which suggest that a feature may not be significant or meaningful in the
context of the model.
- If many variables with small feature importance values have significant p-values, this could indicate that the
model might be overfitting.

**Strengths**:
- Combines two perspectives statistical significance (p-values) and feature importance (decision tree model),
making it a robust feature selection test.
- Provides an interactive visualization making it easy to interpret and understand the results.

**Limitations**:
- The test only works with a regression model and a decision tree model which may limit its applicability.
- The test does not take into account potential correlations or causative relationships between features which may
lead to misinterpretations of significance and importance.
- Over-reliance on the p-value as a cut-off for feature significance can be seen as arbitrary and may not truly
reflect the real-world importance of the feature.
