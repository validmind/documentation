# LogRegressionConfusionMatrix

Generates a confusion matrix for logistic regression model performance, utilizing thresholded probabilities for
classification assessments.

**Purpose**: The Logistic Regression Confusion Matrix is a metric used to measure the performance of a logistic
regression classification model. This metric is particularly useful for scenarios where a model's predictions are
formulated by thresholding probabilities. The main advantage of this approach is that it includes true positives,
true negatives, false positives, and false negatives in its assessment, providing a more comprehensive overview of
the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between correct and incorrect classifications.

**Test Mechanism**: The methodology behind the Logistic Regression Confusion Matrix uses the
`sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix` function from the Python library to generate a matrix. This matrix is created by
comparing the model's predicted probabilities, which are initially converted to binary predictions using a
predetermined cut-off threshold (default is 0.5), against the actual classes. The matrix's design consists of the
predicted class labels forming the x-axis, and the actual class labels forming the y-axis, with each cell
containing the record of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives respectively.

**Signs of High Risk**:
- A significant number of false positives and false negatives, indicating that the model is incorrectly classifying
instances.
- The counts of true positives and true negatives being substantially lower than projected, positioning this as a
potential high-risk indicator.

**Strengths**:
- Simple, intuitive, and provides a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance.
- Provides a detailed breakdown of error types, improving transparency.
- Offers flexible adaptation for diverse prediction scenarios by allowing adjustments to the cut-off threshold, and
enabling exploration of trade-offs between precision (minimizing false positives) and recall (minimizing false
negatives).

**Limitations**:
- Acceptable performance on majority classes but potential poor performance on minority classes in imbalanced
datasets, as the confusion matrix may supply misleading results.
- Lack of insight into the severity of the mistakes and the cost trade-off between different types of
misclassification.
- Selection of the cut-off threshold can significantly alter the interpretation, and a poorly chosen threshold may
lead to erroneous conclusions.
