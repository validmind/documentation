# ResidualsVisualInspection

Provides a comprehensive visual analysis of residuals for regression models utilizing various plot types.

**Purpose**: The main purpose of this metric is to visualize and analyze the residuals (the differences between the
observed and predicted values) of a regression problem. It allows for a graphical exploration of the model's
errors, helping to identify statistical patterns or anomalies that may indicate a systematic bias in the model's
predictions. By inspecting the residuals, we can check how well the model fits the data and meets the assumptions
of the model.

**Test Mechanism**: The metric generates four common types of residual plots which are: a histogram with kernel
density estimation, a quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot, a residuals series dot plot, and an autocorrelation function
(ACF) plot.

- The residuals histogram with kernel density estimation visualizes the distribution of residuals and allows to
check if they are normally distributed.
- Q-Q plot compares the observed quantiles of the data to the quantiles of a standard normal distribution, helping
to assess the normality of residuals.
- A residuals dot plot indicates the variation in residuals over time, which helps in identifying any time-related
pattern in residuals.
- ACF plot visualizes the correlation of an observation with its previous observations, helping to pinpoint any
seasonality effect within residuals.

**Signs of High Risk**:

- Skewness or asymmetry in the histogram or a significant deviation from the straight line in the Q-Q plot, which
indicates that the residuals aren't normally distributed.
- Large spikes in the ACF plot, indicating that the residuals are correlated, in violation of the assumption that
they are independent.
- Non-random patterns in the dot plot of residuals, indicating potential model misspecification.

**Strengths**:

- Visual analysis of residuals is a powerful yet simple way to understand a modelâ€™s behavior across the data set
and to identify problems with the model's assumptions or its fit to the data.
- The test is applicable to any regression model, irrespective of complexity.
- By exploring residuals, we might uncover relationships that were not captured by the model, revealing
opportunities for model improvement.

**Limitations**:

- Visual tests are largely subjective and can be open to interpretation. Clear-cut decisions about the model based
solely on these plots may not be possible.
- The metrics from the test do not directly infer the action based on the results; domain-specific knowledge and
expert judgement is often required to interpret the results.
- These plots can indicate a problem with the model but they do not necessarily reveal the nature or cause of the
problem.
- The test assumes that the error terms are identically distributed, which might not always be the case in
real-world scenarios.
