# ToxicityHistogram

**Purpose:**
The ToxicityHistogram metric visualizes and analyzes the toxicity scores of various texts. Through histograms, it
provides insights into the distribution and nature of toxicity present in the evaluated text segments.

**Test Mechanism:**
Texts are fetched from specified columns and their toxicity scores are computed using a preloaded `toxicity`
evaluation tool. Each text data column is visualized with its own histogram, culminating in a multi-panel
visualization.

**Signs of High Risk:**
High toxicity concentrations in the histogram, especially on the upper scale, signify a higher presence of toxic
content in the respective text segment. If predicted summaries show significantly differing patterns from input or
target texts, it could indicate issues with the model's output.

**Strengths:**
The metric offers a lucid representation of toxicity distributions, facilitating the swift identification of
concerning patterns. It's instrumental for gauging potential pitfalls of generated content, particularly in the
realm of predicted summaries.

**Limitations:**
The ToxicityHistogram's efficacy hinges on the accuracy of the `toxicity` tool it employs. While histograms depict
distribution patterns, they omit details about which specific text portions or tokens result in high toxicity
scores. Therefore, for a comprehensive understanding, more in-depth analysis might be requisite.
