# ToxicityScore

Assesses the toxicity levels of texts generated by NLP models to identify and mitigate harmful or offensive content.

### Purpose

The ToxicityScore metric is designed to evaluate the toxicity levels of texts generated by models. This is crucial
for identifying and mitigating harmful or offensive content in machine-generated texts.

### Test Mechanism

The function starts by extracting the input, true, and predicted values from the provided dataset and model. The
toxicity score is computed for each text using a preloaded `toxicity` evaluation tool. The scores are compiled into
dataframes, and histograms and bar charts are generated to visualize the distribution of toxicity scores.
Additionally, a table of descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) is
compiled for the toxicity scores, providing a comprehensive summary of the model's performance.

### Signs of High Risk

- Drastic spikes in toxicity scores indicate potentially toxic content within the associated text segment.
- Persistent high toxicity scores across multiple texts may suggest systemic issues in the model's text generation
process.

### Strengths

- Provides a clear evaluation of toxicity levels in generated texts, helping to ensure content safety and
appropriateness.
- Visual representations (histograms and bar charts) make it easier to interpret the distribution and trends of
toxicity scores.
- Descriptive statistics offer a concise summary of the model's performance in generating non-toxic texts.

### Limitations

- The accuracy of the toxicity scores is contingent upon the underlying `toxicity` tool.
- The scores provide a broad overview but do not specify which portions or tokens of the text are responsible for
high toxicity.
- Supplementary, in-depth analysis might be needed for granular insights.
