# TimeSeriesPredictionsPlot

Plot actual vs predicted values for time series data and generate a visual comparison for each model.

**Purpose**: The purpose of this function is to visualize the actual versus predicted values for time series data across different models.

**Test Mechanism**: The function iterates through each dataset-model pair, plots the actual values from the dataset, and overlays the predicted values from each model using Plotly for interactive visualization.

**Signs of High Risk**:
- Large discrepancies between actual and predicted values indicate poor model performance.
- Systematic deviations in predicted values can highlight model bias or issues with data patterns.

**Strengths**:
- Provides a clear visual comparison of model predictions against actual values.
- Uses Plotly for interactive and visually appealing plots.
- Can handle multiple models and datasets, displaying them with distinct colors.

**Limitations**:
- Assumes that the dataset is provided as a DataFrameDataset object with a datetime index.
- Requires that `dataset.y_pred(model)` returns the predicted values for the model.
- Visualization might become cluttered with a large number of models or datasets.
