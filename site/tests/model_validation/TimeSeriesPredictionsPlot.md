# TimeSeriesPredictionsPlot

Assesses the model's accuracy in predicting time series data by comparing actual versus predicted values through
visual plots.

### Purpose

The purpose of this function is to visualize the actual versus predicted values for time series data across
different models, aiding in the assessment of model performance.

### Test Mechanism

The function iterates through each dataset-model pair, plots the actual values from the dataset, and overlays the
predicted values from each model using Plotly for interactive visualization. This enables a direct visual
comparison between the modelsâ€™ performance.

### Signs of High Risk

- Large discrepancies between actual and predicted values indicate poor model performance.
- Systematic deviations in predicted values can highlight model bias or issues with data patterns.

### Strengths

- Provides a clear visual comparison of model predictions against actual values.
- Uses Plotly for interactive and visually appealing plots.
- Can handle multiple models and datasets, displaying them with distinct colors.

### Limitations

- Assumes that the dataset is provided as a DataFrameDataset object with a datetime index.
- Requires that `dataset.y_pred(model)` returns the predicted values for the model.
- Visualization might become cluttered with a large number of models or datasets.
