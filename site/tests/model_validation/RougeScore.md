# RougeScore

Evaluates the quality of machine-generated text using ROUGE metrics and visualizes the results through histograms
and bar charts, alongside compiling a comprehensive table of descriptive statistics for each ROUGE metric.

**Purpose:**
This function is designed to assess the quality of text generated by machine learning models using various ROUGE metrics.
ROUGE, which stands for Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation, is a set of metrics used to evaluate the
overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and word pairs between the machine-generated text and reference texts. This evaluation
is crucial for tasks such as text summarization, machine translation, and text generation, where the goal is to produce text
that accurately reflects the content and meaning of human-crafted references.

**Test Mechanism:**
The function starts by extracting the true and predicted values from the provided dataset and model. It then initializes the ROUGE
evaluator with the specified metric (e.g., ROUGE-1). For each pair of true and predicted texts, the function calculates the ROUGE
scores and compiles them into a dataframe. Histograms and bar charts are generated for each ROUGE metric (Precision, Recall, and F1 Score)
to visualize their distribution. Additionally, a table of descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum)
is compiled for each metric, providing a comprehensive summary of the model's performance.

**Signs of High Risk:**

- Consistently low scores across ROUGE metrics could indicate poor quality in the generated text, suggesting that the model fails
to capture the essential content of the reference texts.
- Low precision scores might suggest that the generated text contains a lot of redundant or irrelevant information.
- Low recall scores may indicate that important information from the reference text is being omitted.
- An imbalanced performance between precision and recall, reflected by a low F1 Score, could signal issues in the model's ability
to balance informativeness and conciseness.

**Strengths:**

- Provides a multifaceted evaluation of text quality through different ROUGE metrics, offering a detailed view of model performance.
- Visual representations (histograms and bar charts) make it easier to interpret the distribution and trends of the scores.
- Descriptive statistics offer a concise summary of the model's strengths and weaknesses in generating text.

**Limitations:**

- ROUGE metrics primarily focus on n-gram overlap and may not fully capture semantic coherence, fluency, or grammatical quality of the text.
- The evaluation relies on the availability of high-quality reference texts, which may not always be obtainable.
- While useful for comparison, ROUGE scores alone do not provide a complete assessment of a model's performance and should be
supplemented with other metrics and qualitative analysis.
