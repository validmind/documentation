# CosineSimilarityComparison

Assesses the similarity between embeddings generated by different models using Cosine Similarity, providing both
statistical and visual insights.

### Purpose

The Cosine Similarity Comparison test aims to analyze and compare the embeddings produced by different models using
Cosine Similarity. Cosine Similarity is a measure that calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors,
widely used to determine the alignment or similarity between high-dimensional vectors, such as text embeddings.
This analysis helps understand how similar or different the models' predictions are in terms of embedding
generation.

### Test Mechanism

The function starts by computing the embeddings for each model using the provided dataset. It then calculates the
cosine similarity for every possible pair of models, generating a similarity matrix wherein each element represents
the cosine similarity between two model embeddings. This matrix is flattened to create a bar chart for each model
pair, visualizing their similarity distribution. Additionally, a table with descriptive statistics (mean, median,
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) for the similarities of each pair is compiled, referencing the compared
models.

### Signs of High Risk

- A high concentration of cosine similarity values close to 1 could suggest that the models are producing very
similar embeddings, indicating redundancy or lack of diversity in model training or design.
- Very low similarity values near -1 highlight strong dissimilarity, suggesting models that are too divergent and
possibly focusing on very different features of the data.

### Strengths

- Enables detailed comparisons between multiple models' embedding strategies through visual and statistical means.
- Identifies models producing similar or dissimilar embeddings, useful for tasks requiring model diversity.
- Provides quantitative and visual feedback on the degree of similarity, enhancing interpretability of model
behavior in embedding spaces.

### Limitations

- The analysis is confined to the comparison of embeddings and does not assess the overall performance of the
models in terms of their primary tasks (e.g., classification, regression).
- Assumes that the models are suitable for generating comparable embeddings, which might not always be the case,
especially across different types of models.
- Interpretation of results is heavily dependent on the understanding of Cosine Similarity and the nature of
high-dimensional embedding spaces.
