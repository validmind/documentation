# EuclideanDistanceComparison

Computes pairwise Euclidean distances between model embeddings and visualizes the results through bar charts,
alongside compiling a comprehensive table of descriptive statistics for each model pair.

**Purpose:**
This function is designed to analyze and compare the embeddings produced by different models using Euclidean Distance.
Euclidean Distance measures the "ordinary" straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space, providing a
straightforward metric to assess the absolute differences between vectors. This analysis helps in understanding the
magnitude of dissimilarity between the embeddings generated by different models, which is crucial for tasks that require
distinctive model responses or feature separations.

**Test Mechanism:**
The function begins by computing the embeddings for each model using the provided dataset. It then calculates the
Euclidean distance for every possible pair of models, generating a distance matrix. Each element of this matrix
represents the Euclidean distance between two model embeddings. The function flattens this matrix and uses it to
create a bar chart for each model pair, visualizing their distance distribution. Additionally, it compiles a table
with descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) for the distances of each
pair, including a reference to the compared models.

**Signs of High Risk:**

- Very high distance values could suggest that the models are focusing on completely different features or aspects
of the data, which might be undesirable for ensemble methods or similar applications where some degree of
consensus is expected.
- Extremely low distances across different models might indicate redundancy, suggesting that the models are not
providing diverse enough perspectives on the data.

**Strengths:**

- Provides a clear and quantifiable measure of how different the embeddings from various models are.
- Useful for identifying outlier models or those that behave significantly differently from others in a group.

**Limitations:**

- Euclidean distance can be sensitive to the scale of the data, meaning that preprocessing steps like normalization
might be necessary to ensure meaningful comparisons.
- Does not consider the orientation or angle between vectors, focusing purely on magnitude differences.
