# RegardScore

Computes and visualizes the regard score for each text instance, assessing sentiment and potential biases.

**Purpose:**
The `RegardScore` metric is designed to evaluate the regard levels (positive, negative, neutral, or other) of texts generated by models. This helps in understanding the sentiment and biases in the generated content.

**Test Mechanism:**
The function starts by extracting the true and predicted values from the provided dataset and model. The regard scores are computed for each text using a preloaded `regard` evaluation tool. The scores are compiled into dataframes, and histograms and bar charts are generated to visualize the distribution of regard scores. Additionally, a table of descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) is compiled for the regard scores, providing a comprehensive summary of the model's performance.

**Signs of High Risk:**
- Noticeable skewness in the histogram, especially when comparing the predicted regard scores with the target regard scores, could indicate biases or inconsistencies in the model.
- Lack of neutral scores in the model's predictions, despite a balanced distribution in the target data, might signal an issue.

**Strengths:**
- Provides a clear evaluation of regard levels in generated texts, helping to ensure content appropriateness.
- Visual representations (histograms and bar charts) make it easier to interpret the distribution and trends of regard scores.
- Descriptive statistics offer a concise summary of the model's performance in generating texts with balanced sentiments.

**Limitations:**
- The accuracy of the regard scores is contingent upon the underlying `regard` tool.
- The scores provide a broad overview but do not specify which portions or tokens of the text are responsible for high regard.
- Supplementary, in-depth analysis might be needed for granular insights.
