# HyperParametersTuning

Performs exhaustive grid search over specified parameter ranges to find optimal model configurations
across different metrics and decision thresholds.

### Purpose

The Hyperparameter Tuning test systematically explores the model's parameter space to identify optimal
configurations. It supports multiple optimization metrics and decision thresholds, providing a comprehensive
view of how different parameter combinations affect various aspects of model performance.

### Test Mechanism

The test uses scikit-learn's GridSearchCV to perform cross-validation for each parameter combination.
For each specified threshold and optimization metric, it creates a scoring dictionary with
threshold-adjusted metrics, performs grid search with cross-validation, records best parameters and
corresponding scores, and combines results into a comparative table. This process is repeated for each
optimization metric to provide a comprehensive view of model performance under different configurations.

### Signs of High Risk

- Large performance variations across different parameter combinations
- Significant discrepancies between different optimization metrics
- Best parameters at the edges of the parameter grid
- Unstable performance across different thresholds
- Overly complex model configurations (risk of overfitting)
- Very different optimal parameters for different metrics
- Cross-validation scores showing high variance
- Extreme parameter values in best configurations

### Strengths

- Comprehensive exploration of parameter space
- Supports multiple optimization metrics
- Allows threshold optimization
- Provides comparative view across different configurations
- Uses cross-validation for robust evaluation
- Helps understand trade-offs between different metrics
- Enables systematic parameter selection
- Supports both classification and clustering tasks

### Limitations

- Computationally expensive for large parameter grids
- May not find global optimum (limited to grid points)
- Cannot handle dependencies between parameters
- Memory intensive for large datasets
- Limited to scikit-learn compatible models
- Cross-validation splits may not preserve time series structure
- Grid search may miss optimal values between grid points
- Resource intensive for high-dimensional parameter spaces
