# BleuScore

Evaluates the quality of machine-generated text using BLEU metrics and visualizes the results through histograms
and bar charts, alongside compiling a comprehensive table of descriptive statistics for BLEU scores.

### Purpose

This function is designed to assess the quality of text generated by machine learning models using the BLEU metric.
BLEU, which stands for Bilingual Evaluation Understudy, is a metric used to evaluate the overlap of n-grams between
the machine-generated text and reference texts. This evaluation is crucial for tasks such as text summarization,
machine translation, and text generation, where the goal is to produce text that accurately reflects the content
and meaning of human-crafted references.

### Test Mechanism

The function starts by extracting the true and predicted values from the provided dataset and model. It then
initializes the BLEU evaluator. For each pair of true and predicted texts, the function calculates the BLEU scores
and compiles them into a dataframe. Histograms and bar charts are generated for the BLEU scores to visualize their
distribution. Additionally, a table of descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and
maximum) is compiled for the BLEU scores, providing a comprehensive summary of the model's performance.

### Signs of High Risk

- Consistently low BLEU scores could indicate poor quality in the generated text, suggesting that the model fails
to capture the essential content of the reference texts.
- Low precision scores might suggest that the generated text contains a lot of redundant or irrelevant information.
- Low recall scores may indicate that important information from the reference text is being omitted.
- An imbalanced performance between precision and recall, reflected by a low BLEU score, could signal issues in the
model's ability to balance informativeness and conciseness.

### Strengths

- Provides a straightforward and widely-used evaluation of text quality through BLEU scores.
- Visual representations (histograms and bar charts) make it easier to interpret the distribution and trends of the
scores.
- Descriptive statistics offer a concise summary of the model's strengths and weaknesses in generating text.

### Limitations

- BLEU metrics primarily focus on n-gram overlap and may not fully capture semantic coherence, fluency, or
grammatical quality of the text.
- The evaluation relies on the availability of high-quality reference texts, which may not always be obtainable.
- While useful for comparison, BLEU scores alone do not provide a complete assessment of a model's performance and
should be supplemented with other metrics and qualitative analysis.
