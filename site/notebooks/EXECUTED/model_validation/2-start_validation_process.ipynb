    "You'll learn how to run relevant validation tests with ValidMind, log the results of those tests to the ValidMind Platform, and insert your logged test results as evidence into your validation report. You'll become familiar with the tests available in ValidMind, as well as how to run them. Running tests during model validation is crucial to the effective challenge process, as we want to independently evaluate the evidence and assessments provided by the model development team.\n",
