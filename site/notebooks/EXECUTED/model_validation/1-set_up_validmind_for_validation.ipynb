    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Model validation aims to independently assess the compliance of *champion models* created by model developers with regulatory guidance by conducting thorough testing and analysis, potentially including the use of challenger models to benchmark performance. Assessments, presented in the form of a validation report, typically include *model findings* and recommendations to address those issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *binary classification model* is a type of predictive model used in churn analysis to identify customers who are likely to leave a service or subscription by analyzing various behavioral, transactional, and demographic factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This model helps businesses take proactive measures to retain at-risk customers by offering personalized incentives, improving customer service, or adjusting pricing strategies.\n",
    "- Effective validation of a churn prediction model ensures that businesses can accurately identify potential churners, optimize retention efforts, and enhance overall customer satisfaction while minimizing revenue loss."

    "\n",
    "ValidMind is a suite of tools for managing model risk, including risk associated with AI and statistical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You use the ValidMind Library to automate comparison and other validation tests, and then use the ValidMind Platform to submit compliance assessments of champion models via comprehensive validation reports. Together, these products simplify model risk management, facilitate compliance with regulations and institutional standards, and enhance collaboration between yourself and model developers."

    "### Key concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation report**: A comprehensive and structured assessment of a model’s development and performance, focusing on verifying its integrity, appropriateness, and alignment with its intended use. It includes analyses of model assumptions, data quality, performance metrics, outcomes of testing procedures, and risk considerations. The validation report supports transparency, regulatory compliance, and informed decision-making by documenting the validator’s independent review and conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation report template**: Serves as a standardized framework for conducting and documenting model validation activities. It outlines the required sections, recommended analyses, and expected validation tests, ensuring consistency and completeness across validation reports. The template helps guide validators through a systematic review process while promoting comparability and traceability of validation outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests**: A function contained in the ValidMind Library, designed to run a specific quantitative test on the dataset or model. Tests are the building blocks of ValidMind, used to evaluate and document models and datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metrics**: A subset of tests that do not have thresholds. In the context of this notebook, metrics and tests can be thought of as interchangeable concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom metrics**: Custom metrics are functions that you define to evaluate your model or dataset. These functions can be registered with the ValidMind Library to be used in the ValidMind Platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs**: Objects to be evaluated and documented in the ValidMind Library. They can be any of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **model**: A single model that has been initialized in ValidMind with [`vm.init_model()`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind.html#init_model).\n",
    "  - **dataset**: Single dataset that has been initialized in ValidMind with [`vm.init_dataset()`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind.html#init_dataset).\n",
    "  - **models**: A list of ValidMind models - usually this is used when you want to compare multiple models in your custom metric.\n",
    "  - **datasets**: A list of ValidMind datasets - usually this is used when you want to compare multiple datasets in your custom metric. (Learn more: [Run tests with multiple datasets](https://docs.validmind.ai/notebooks/how_to/run_tests_that_require_multiple_datasets.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters**: Additional arguments that can be passed when running a ValidMind test, used to pass additional information to a metric, customize its behavior, or provide additional context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outputs**: Custom metrics can return elements like tables or plots. Tables may be a list of dictionaries (each representing a row) or a pandas DataFrame. Plots may be matplotlib or plotly figures."
