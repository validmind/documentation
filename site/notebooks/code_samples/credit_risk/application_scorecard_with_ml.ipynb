    "Build and document an *application scorecard model* with the ValidMind Library by using Kaggle's [Lending Club](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devanshi23/loan-data-2007-2014/data) sample dataset to build a simple application scorecard.\n",
    "\n",
    "An application scorecard model is a type of statistical model used in credit scoring to evaluate the creditworthiness of potential borrowers by generating a score based on various characteristics of an applicant — such as credit history, income, employment status, and other relevant financial data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- This score helps lenders make decisions about whether to approve or reject loan applications, as well as determine the terms of the loan, including interest rates and credit limits. \n",
    "- Application scorecard models enable lenders to manage risk efficiently while making the loan application process faster and more transparent for applicants.\n",
    "\n",
    "This interactive notebook provides a step-by-step guide for loading a demo dataset, preprocessing the raw data, training a model for testing, setting up test inputs, initializing the required ValidMind objects, running the test, and then logging the results to ValidMind."

    "## About ValidMind\n",
    "ValidMind is a suite of tools for managing model risk, including risk associated with AI and statistical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You use the ValidMind Library to automate documentation and validation tests, and then use the ValidMind Platform to collaborate on model documentation. Together, these products simplify model risk management, facilitate compliance with regulations and institutional standards, and enhance collaboration between yourself and model validators.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='toc1_1__'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before you begin\n",
    "This notebook assumes you have basic familiarity with Python, including an understanding of how functions work. If you are new to Python, you can still run the notebook but we recommend further familiarizing yourself with the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter errors due to missing modules in your Python environment, install the modules with `pip install`, and then re-run the notebook. For more help, refer to [Installing Python Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html).\n",

    "### New to ValidMind?\n",
    "If you haven't already seen our documentation on the [ValidMind Library](https://docs.validmind.ai/developer/validmind-library.html), we recommend you begin by exploring the available resources in this section. There, you can learn more about documenting models and running tests, as well as find code samples and our Python Library API reference.\n",

    "### Key concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model documentation**: A structured and detailed record pertaining to a model, encompassing key components such as its underlying assumptions, methodologies, data sources, inputs, performance metrics, evaluations, limitations, and intended uses. It serves to ensure transparency, adherence to regulatory requirements, and a clear understanding of potential risks associated with the model’s application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Documentation template**: Functions as a test suite and lays out the structure of model documentation, segmented into various sections and sub-sections. Documentation templates define the structure of your model documentation, specifying the tests that should be run, and how the results should be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests**: A function contained in the ValidMind Library, designed to run a specific quantitative test on the dataset or model. Tests are the building blocks of ValidMind, used to evaluate and document models and datasets, and can be run individually or as part of a suite defined by your model documentation template.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom tests**: Custom tests are functions that you define to evaluate your model or dataset. These functions can be registered via the ValidMind Library to be used with the ValidMind Platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs**: Objects to be evaluated and documented in the ValidMind Library. They can be any of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **model**: A single model that has been initialized in ValidMind with [`vm.init_model()`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind.html#init_model).\n",
    "- **dataset**: Single dataset that has been initialized in ValidMind with [`vm.init_dataset()`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind.html#init_dataset).\n",
    "- **models**: A list of ValidMind models - usually this is used when you want to compare multiple models in your custom test.\n",
    "- **datasets**: A list of ValidMind datasets - usually this is used when you want to compare multiple datasets in your custom test. See this [example](https://docs.validmind.ai/notebooks/how_to/run_tests_that_require_multiple_datasets.html) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters**: Additional arguments that can be passed when running a ValidMind test, used to pass additional information to a test, customize its behavior, or provide additional context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outputs**: Custom tests can return elements like tables or plots. Tables may be a list of dictionaries (each representing a row) or a pandas DataFrame. Plots may be matplotlib or plotly figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test suites**: Collections of tests designed to run together to automate and generate model documentation end-to-end for specific use-cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: The [`classifier_full_suite`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind/test_suites/classifier.html#ClassifierFullSuite) test suite runs tests from the [`tabular_dataset`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind/test_suites/tabular_datasets.html) and [`classifier`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind/test_suites/classifier.html) test suites to fully document the data and model sections for binary classification model use-cases."

A test \"Provider\" is a Python class that gets registered with the ValidMind Library and loads tests based on a test ID, for example `my_test_provider.my_test_id`. The built-in suite of tests that ValidMind offers is technically its own test provider. You can use one the built-in test provider offered by ValidMind (`validmind.tests.test_providers.LocalTestProvider`) or you can create your own. More than likely, you'll want to use the `LocalTestProvider` to add a directory of custom tests but there's flexibility to be able to load tests from any source."

For our custom tests, the test ID will be the `namespace` specified when registering the provider, followed by the path to the test file relative to the tests folder. For example, the Confusion Matrix test we created earlier will have the test ID `my_test_provider.ConfusionMatrix`. You could organize the tests in subfolders, say `classification` and `regression`, and the test ID for the Confusion Matrix test would then be `my_test_provider.classification.ConfusionMatrix`."
