    "# Quickstart for Heston option pricing model using QuantLib\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! Let's get you started with the basic process of documenting models with ValidMind.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Heston option pricing model is a popular stochastic volatility model used to price options. Developed by Steven Heston in 1993, the model assumes that the asset's volatility follows a mean-reverting square-root process, allowing it to capture the empirical observation of volatility \"clustering\" in financial markets. This model is particularly useful for assets where volatility is not constant, making it a favored approach in quantitative finance for pricing complex derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an overview of the Heston model as implemented in QuantLib, a powerful library for quantitative finance:\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='toc1_1__'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Assumptions and Characteristics\n",
    "1. **Stochastic Volatility**: The volatility is modeled as a stochastic process, following a mean-reverting square-root process (Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process).\n",
    "2. **Correlated Asset and Volatility Processes**: The asset price and volatility are assumed to be correlated, allowing the model to capture the \"smile\" effect observed in implied volatilities.\n",
    "3. **Risk-Neutral Dynamics**: The Heston model is typically calibrated under a risk-neutral measure, which allows for direct application to pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='toc1_2__'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heston Model Parameters\n",
    "The model is governed by a set of key parameters:\n",
    "- **S0**: Initial stock price\n",
    "- **v0**: Initial variance of the asset price\n",
    "- **kappa**: Speed of mean reversion of the variance\n",
    "- **theta**: Long-term mean level of variance\n",
    "- **sigma**: Volatility of volatility (vol of vol)\n",
    "- **rho**: Correlation between the asset price and variance processes\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamics of the asset price \\( S \\) and the variance \\( v \\) under the Heston model are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "dS_t = r S_t \\, dt + \\sqrt{v_t} S_t \\, dW^S_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "dv_t = \\kappa (\\theta - v_t) \\, dt + \\sigma \\sqrt{v_t} \\, dW^v_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( $dW^S$ \\) and \\( $dW^v$ \\) are Wiener processes with correlation \\( $\\rho$ \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='toc1_3__'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages and Limitations\n",
    "- **Advantages**:\n",
    "  - Ability to capture volatility smiles and skews.\n",
    "  - More realistic pricing for options on assets with stochastic volatility.\n",
    "- **Limitations**:\n",
    "  - Calibration can be complex due to the number of parameters.\n",
    "  - Computationally intensive compared to simpler models like Black-Scholes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup provides a robust framework for pricing and analyzing options with stochastic volatility dynamics. QuantLib’s implementation makes it easy to experiment with different parameter configurations and observe their effects on pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn how to initialize the ValidMind Library, develop a option pricing model, and then write custom tests that can be used for sensitivity and stress testing to quickly generate documentation about model."

    "### Key concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model documentation**: A structured and detailed record pertaining to a model, encompassing key components such as its underlying assumptions, methodologies, data sources, inputs, performance metrics, evaluations, limitations, and intended uses. It serves to ensure transparency, adherence to regulatory requirements, and a clear understanding of potential risks associated with the model’s application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Documentation template**: Functions as a test suite and lays out the structure of model documentation, segmented into various sections and sub-sections. Documentation templates define the structure of your model documentation, specifying the tests that should be run, and how the results should be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests**: A function contained in the ValidMind Library, designed to run a specific quantitative test on the dataset or model. Tests are the building blocks of ValidMind, used to evaluate and document models and datasets, and can be run individually or as part of a suite defined by your model documentation template.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom tests**: Custom tests are functions that you define to evaluate your model or dataset. These functions can be registered via the ValidMind Library to be used with the ValidMind Platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs**: Objects to be evaluated and documented in the ValidMind Library. They can be any of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **model**: A single model that has been initialized in ValidMind with [`vm.init_model()`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind.html#init_model).\n",
    "  - **dataset**: Single dataset that has been initialized in ValidMind with [`vm.init_dataset()`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind.html#init_dataset).\n",
    "  - **models**: A list of ValidMind models - usually this is used when you want to compare multiple models in your custom test.\n",
    "  - **datasets**: A list of ValidMind datasets - usually this is used when you want to compare multiple datasets in your custom test. See this [example](https://docs.validmind.ai/notebooks/how_to/run_tests_that_require_multiple_datasets.html) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters**: Additional arguments that can be passed when running a ValidMind test, used to pass additional information to a test, customize its behavior, or provide additional context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outputs**: Custom tests can return elements like tables or plots. Tables may be a list of dictionaries (each representing a row) or a pandas DataFrame. Plots may be matplotlib or plotly figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test suites**: Collections of tests designed to run together to automate and generate model documentation end-to-end for specific use-cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: the [`classifier_full_suite`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind/test_suites/classifier.html#ClassifierFullSuite) test suite runs tests from the [`tabular_dataset`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind/test_suites/tabular_datasets.html) and [`classifier`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind/test_suites/classifier.html) test suites to fully document the data and model sections for binary classification model use-cases."
