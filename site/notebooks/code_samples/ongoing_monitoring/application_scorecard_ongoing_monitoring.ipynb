    "\n",
    "ValidMind is a suite of tools for managing model risk, including risk associated with AI and statistical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You use the ValidMind Library to automate documentation, validation, monitoring tests, and then use the ValidMind Platform to collaborate on model documentation. Together, these products simplify model risk management, facilitate compliance with regulations and institutional standards, and enhance collaboration between yourself and model validators.\n",

    "### Before you begin\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook assumes you have basic familiarity with Python, including an understanding of how functions work. If you are new to Python, you can still run the notebook but we recommend further familiarizing yourself with the language. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter errors due to missing modules in your Python environment, install the modules with `pip install`, and then re-run the notebook. For more help, refer to [Installing Python Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html).\n",

    "If you haven't already seen our documentation on the [ValidMind Library](https://docs.validmind.ai/developer/validmind-library.html), we recommend you begin by exploring the available resources in this section. There, you can learn more about documenting models and running tests, as well as find code samples and our Python Library API reference.\n",

    "### Key concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model documentation**: A structured and detailed record pertaining to a model, encompassing key components such as its underlying assumptions, methodologies, data sources, inputs, performance metrics, evaluations, limitations, and intended uses. It serves to ensure transparency, adherence to regulatory requirements, and a clear understanding of potential risks associated with the model’s application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Documentation template**: Functions as a test suite and lays out the structure of model documentation, segmented into various sections and sub-sections. Documentation templates define the structure of your model documentation, specifying the tests that should be run, and how the results should be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model monitoring documentation**: A comprehensive and structured record of a production model, including key elements such as data sources, inputs, performance metrics, and periodic evaluations. This documentation ensures transparency and visibility of the model's performance in the production environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Monitoring documentation template**: Similar to documentation template, The monitoring documentation template functions as a test suite and lays out the structure of model monitoring documentation, segmented into various sections and sub-sections. Monitoring documentation templates define the structure of your model monitoring documentation, specifying the tests that should be run, and how the results should be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests**: A function contained in the ValidMind Library, designed to run a specific quantitative test on the dataset or model. Tests are the building blocks of ValidMind, used to evaluate and document models and datasets, and can be run individually or as part of a suite defined by your model documentation template.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom tests**: Custom tests are functions that you define to evaluate your model or dataset. These functions can be registered via the ValidMind Library to be used with the ValidMind Platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs**: Objects to be evaluated and documented in the ValidMind Library. They can be any of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **model**: A single model that has been initialized in ValidMind with [`vm.init_model()`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind.html#init_model).\n",
    "  - **dataset**: Single dataset that has been initialized in ValidMind with [`vm.init_dataset()`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind.html#init_dataset).\n",
    "  - **models**: A list of ValidMind models - usually this is used when you want to compare multiple models in your custom test.\n",
    "  - **datasets**: A list of ValidMind datasets - usually this is used when you want to compare multiple datasets in your custom test. See this [example](https://docs.validmind.ai/notebooks/how_to/run_tests_that_require_multiple_datasets.html) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters**: Additional arguments that can be passed when running a ValidMind test, used to pass additional information to a test, customize its behavior, or provide additional context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outputs**: Custom tests can return elements like tables or plots. Tables may be a list of dictionaries (each representing a row) or a pandas DataFrame. Plots may be matplotlib or plotly figures."
