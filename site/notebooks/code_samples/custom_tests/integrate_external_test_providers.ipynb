    "# Integrate external test providers\n",
    "\n",
    "Register a custom test provider with the ValidMind Library to run your own tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ValidMind Library offers the ability to extend the built-in library of tests with custom tests. If you've followed along in the [Implement custom tests notebook](./implement_custom_tests.ipynb), you will be familiar with the process of creating custom tests and running them for use in your model documentation. In that notebook, the tests were defined inline, as a notebook cell, using the `validmind.test` decorator. This works very well when you just want to create one-off, ad-hoc tests or for experimenting. But for more complex, reusable and shareable tests, it is recommended to use a more structured approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the concept of External Test Providers come in. A test \"Provider\" is a Python class that gets registered with the ValidMind Library and loads tests based on a test ID, for example `my_test_provider.my_test_id`. The built-in suite of tests that ValidMind offers is technically its own test provider. You can use one the built-in test provider offered by ValidMind (`validmind.tests.test_providers.LocalTestProvider`) or you can create your own. More than likely, you'll want to use the `LocalTestProvider` to add a directory of custom tests but there's flexibility to be able to load tests from any source.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll take you through the process of creating a folder of custom tests from existing, inline tests. We'll then show you how to defined and register a `LocalTestProvider` that points to that folder. Finally, we'll show how the test ID works when using test providers and how you can run and use custom tests from your provider."

    "- **Test Provider**: A Python class that gets registered with the ValidMind Library and loads tests based on a test ID e.g. `my_test_provider.my_test_id`.\n",
    "- **LocalTestProvider**: A built-in test provider that loads tests from a local directory.\n",
    "- **Test ID**: A unique identifier for a test that is used to load the test from a test provider. Test IDs in ValidMind have multiple parts, separated by dots (`.`), that have special meaning/functions - `namespace.path.test_name:result_id` (e.g. `validmind.data_validation.ClassImbalance:1`):\n",
    "    - `namespace`: The namespace of the test - built-in tests use the `validmind` namespace, custom test providers specify a custom namespace when they are registered\n",
    "    - `path`: The path to the test within the test provider. For internal tests, this is relative to the `validmind/tests` directory. When using a `LocalTestProvider` this is relative to the root directory you specify when creating the provider class instance. **Note: This path-based approach is a convention and not a strict requirement when implementing your own test provider.**\n",
    "    - `test_name`: The name of the test module (file) as well as the name of the function or class that is the \"test\" itself. Again, this is a convention for internal and `LocalTestProvider` tests, but test files should be named the same as the test function or class they contain.\n",
    "    - `result_id`: An optional identifier for the test. Especially useful, and required, for running tests multiple times in one section. This is separated from the previous parts by a colon `:` and can be effectively ignored when loading the test itself as its only used to uniquely identify the test result."

We created a custom test provider that loads tests from a folder and then ran the tests against a model and dataset.

This is a powerful concept that allows you to create, organize and, most importantly, share custom tests with other model developers."
