The use case is a summarization of financial news based on a dataset containing just over 300k unique news articles as written by journalists at CNN and the Daily Mail. It shows you how to set up the ValidMind Developer Framework, initialize the client library, and load the dataset, followed by running the model validation tests provided by the framework to quickly generate documentation about the data and model."
