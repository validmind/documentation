# ValidMind sample notebooks

Our [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) code samples are designed to showcase the capabilities and features of ValidMind, while also providing you with useful examples that you can build on and adapt for your own use cases.

Sample notebooks are organized into the following folders:

* `notebooks/quickstart` — Quick guides to get you started with ValidMind
* `notebooks/tutorials` — High-level courses covering usage of ValidMind for specific roles or concepts, such as model development
* `notebooks/how_to` — Learn how to use specific ValidMind features, for example how to run tests
* `notebooks/use_cases` — Demo end-to-end use cases for ValidMind, such as documenting or validating specific kinds of models
* `notebooks/code_sharing` — Share your own notebooks or document code internally

## Getting started

ValidMind enables organizations to identify, document, and manage model risks for all types of models, including AI/ML models, LLMs, and statistical models. As a model developer, you use the ValidMind Library to automate documentation and validation tests, and then use the ValidMind Platform to collaborate on documentation projects. Together, these products simplify model risk management, facilitate compliance with regulations and institutional standards, and enhance collaboration between yourself and model validators.

If this is your first time trying out ValidMind, you can make use of the following resources alongside our sample notebooks:

- [Get started](https://docs.validmind.ai/get-started/get-started.html) — The basics, including key concepts, and how our products work
- [ValidMind Library](https://docs.validmind.ai/developer/validmind-library.html) —  The path for developers, more code samples, and our developer reference
