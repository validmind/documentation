    "# Customize test result descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run ValidMind tests, test descriptions are automatically generated with LLM using the test results, the test name, and the static test definitions provided in the test's docstring. While this metadata offers valuable high-level overviews of tests, insights produced by the LLM-based descriptions may not always align with your specific use cases or incorporate organizational policy requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll learn how to take complete control over the context that drives test description generation. ValidMind provides a `context` parameter in `run_test` that accepts a dictionary with three complementary keys for comprehensive context management:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `instructions`: Overwrites ValidMind’s default result description structure. If you provide custom instructions, they take full priority over the built-in ones. This parameter controls how the final description is structured and presented. Use this to specify formatting requirements, target different audiences (executives vs. technical teams), or ensure consistent report styles across your organization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- `test_description`: Overwrites the test’s built-in docstring if provided. This parameter contains the technical mechanics of how the test works. However, for generic tests where the methodology isn't the focus, you may use this to describe what's actually being analyzed—the specific variables, features, or metrics being plotted and their business meaning rather than the statistical mechanics. You can also override ValidMind's built-in test documentation if you prefer different structure or language. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `additional_context`: Does not overwrite the instructions or test descriptions, but instead adds to them. This parameter provides any background information you want the LLM to consider when analyzing results. It could include business priorities, acceptance thresholds, regulatory requirements, domain expertise, use case details, model purpose, or stakeholder concerns—any information that helps the LLM better understand and interpret your specific situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these context parameters allow you to manage every aspect of how the LLM interprets and presents your test results. Whether you need to align descriptions with regulatory requirements, target specific audiences, incorporate organizational policies, or ensure consistent reporting standards, this context management approach gives you the flexibility to generate descriptions that perfectly match your needs while still leveraging the analytical power of AI-generated insights."

    "### Structure of ValidMind built-in test docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "Every ValidMind built-in test includes a docstring that serves as its default documentation. This docstring follows a consistent structure so that both users and the LLM can rely on a predictable format. While the content varies depending on the type of test—for example, highly specific tests like SHAP values or PSI provide technical detail, whereas generic tests like descriptive statistics or histograms are more general—the overall layout remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical docstring contains the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overview:**\n",
    "A short description of what the test does and what kind of output it generates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:**\n",
    "Explains why the test exists and what it is designed to evaluate. This section provides the context for the test’s role in model documentation, often describing the intended use cases or the kind of insights it supports.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test mechanism**:\n",
    "Describes how the test works internally. This includes the approach or methodology, what inputs are used, how results are calculated or visualized, and the logic behind the test’s implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Signs of high risks:**\n",
    "Outlines risk indicators that are specific to the test. These highlight situations where results should be interpreted with caution—for example, imbalances in distributions or errors in processing steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strengths:**\n",
    "Highlights the capabilities and benefits of the test, explaining what makes it particularly useful and what kinds of insights it provides that may not be captured elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limitations:**\n",
    "Discusses the constraints of the test, including technical shortcomings, interpretive challenges, and situations where the results might be misleading or incomplete.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure ensures that all built-in tests provide a comprehensive explanation of their purpose, mechanics, strengths, and limitations. For more generic tests, the docstring may read as boilerplate information about the test’s mechanics. In these cases, the `doc` parameter can be used to override the docstring with context that is more relevant to the dataset, feature, or business use case under analysis."

    "### Understanding the test description parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "Overriding the docstring with the `test_description` parameter is particularly valuable for more generic tests, where the default text often focuses on the mechanics of producing an output rather than the data or variable being analyzed. For example, instead of including documentation about the details about the methodology used to compute an histogram, you may want to document the business meaning of the feature being visualized, its expected distribution, or what to pay attention to. Similarly, when generating a descriptive statistics table, you may prefer documentation that describes the dataset under review. \n",
    "\n",
    "Customizing the doc, allows you to shift the focus of the explanation from the test machinery to the aspects of the data that matter most for your audience, while still relying on the built-in docstring for cases where the default detail is already fit for purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to override**\n",
    "\n",
    "For tests like histograms or descriptive statistics where the statistical methodology is standard and uninteresting, replace the generic documentation with meaningful descriptions of the variables being analyzed. Also use this to customize ValidMind's built-in test documentation when you want different terminology, structure, or emphasis than what's provided by default."

    "\n",
    "**Choose the right parameter for each need:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `test_description` for technical corrections when you need to fix or clarify test methodology, override ValidMind's built-in documentation with your preferred structure or terminology, replace generic test mechanics with meaningful descriptions of variables and features being analyzed, or provide domain-specific context for regulatory compliance. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply `additional_context` for business rules like performance thresholds and decision criteria, business context such as customer economics and operational constraints, threshold-driven decision logic, regulatory requirements, real-time information like dates or risk indicators, stakeholder priorities, or any background information that helps the LLM interpret results in your specific context\n",
    "\n",
    "- Leverage `instructions` for audience targeting to control format and presentation style, create structured templates with specific sections and placeholders for LLM fill-ins, combine hardcoded mandatory text with dynamic analysis, and ensure consistent organizational reporting standards across different stakeholder groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Avoid redundancy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't repeat the same information across multiple parameters, as each parameter should add unique value to the description generation. If content overlaps, choose the most appropriate parameter for that information to maintain clarity and prevent conflicting or duplicate guidance in your test descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Increasing consistency and grounding:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since LLMs can produce variable responses, use hardcoded sections in your instructions for content that requires no variability, combined with specific placeholders for data you trust the LLM to generate. For example, include mandatory disclaimers, policy references, and fixed formatting exactly as written, while using placeholders like `[ANALYZE_PERFORMANCE_METRICS]` for dynamic content. This approach ensures critical information appears consistently while still leveraging the LLM's analytical capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `test_description` and `additional_context` parameters to anchor test results descriptions in your specific domain and business context, preventing the LLM from generating generic or inappropriate interpretations. Then use `instructions` to explicitly direct the LLM to ground its analysis in this provided context, such as \"Base all recommendations on the thresholds specified in the additional context section\" or \"Interpret all metrics according to the test description provided.\""
