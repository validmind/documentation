    "The `assign_scores()` method is a powerful feature that allows you to compute and add scorer scores as new columns in your dataset. This method takes a model and metric(s) as input, computes the specified metrics from the ValidMind scorer library, and adds them as new columns. The computed metrics provide per-row values, giving you granular insights into model performance at the individual prediction level.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this interactive notebook, we demonstrate how to use the `assign_scores()` method effectively. We'll walk through a complete example using a customer churn dataset, showing how to compute and assign row-level metrics (like Brier Score and Log Loss) that provide detailed performance insights for each prediction. You'll learn how to work with single and multiple scorers, pass custom parameters, and handle different metric types - all while maintaining a clean, organized dataset structure. Currently, assign_scores() supports all metrics available in the validmind.scorer module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Power of Row-Level Scoring**\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional model evaluation workflows often focus on aggregate metrics that provide overall performance summaries. The `assign_scores()` method complements this by providing granular, row-level insights that help you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Identify Problematic Predictions**: Spot individual cases where your model performs poorly\n",
    "- **Understand Model Behavior**: Analyze how model performance varies across different types of inputs\n",
    "- **Enable Detailed Analysis**: Perform targeted investigations on specific subsets of your data\n",
    "- **Support Model Debugging**: Pinpoint exactly where and why your model makes errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding assign_scores()**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `assign_scores()` method computes row metrics for a given model-dataset combination and adds the results as new columns to your dataset. Each new column follows the naming convention: `{model.input_id}_{metric_name}`, ensuring clear identification of which model and metric combination generated each score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Row-Level Focus**: Computes per-prediction metrics rather than aggregate scores\n",
    "- **Flexible Input**: Accepts single metrics or lists of metrics\n",
    "- **Parameter Support**: Allows passing additional parameters to underlying metric implementations\n",
    "- **Multi-Model Support**: Can assign scores from multiple models to the same dataset\n",
    "- **Type Agnostic**: Works with classification, regression, and other model types\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach provides detailed insights into your model's performance at the individual prediction level, enabling more sophisticated analysis and debugging workflows."
