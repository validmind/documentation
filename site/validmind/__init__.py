"""
The ValidMind Library is a suite of developer tools and methods designed to automate the documentation and validation of your models.

Designed to be model agnostic, the ValidMind Library provides all the standard functionality without requiring you to rewrite any functions as long as your model is built in Python.

With a rich array of documentation tools and test suites, from documenting descriptions of your datasets to testing your models for weak spots and overfit areas, the ValidMind Library helps you automate model documentation by feeding the ValidMind Platform with documentation artifacts and test results.

To install the client library:

```bash
pip install validmind
```

To initialize the client library, paste the code snippet with the client integration details directly into your
development source code, replacing this example with your own:

```python
import validmind as vm

vm.init(
  api_host = "https://api.dev.vm.validmind.ai/api/v1/tracking/tracking",
  api_key = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  api_secret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  project = "<project-identifier>"
)
```

After you have pasted the code snippet into your development source code and executed the code, the Python client
library will register with ValidMind. You can now use the ValidMind Library to document and test your models,
and to upload to the ValidMind Platform.
