def ZivotAndrewsArch(dataset: VMDataset):
    """
    Evaluates the order of integration and stationarity of time series data using the Zivot-Andrews unit root test.

    ### Purpose

    The Zivot-Andrews Arch metric is used to evaluate the order of integration for time series data in a machine
    learning model. It's designed to test for stationarity, a crucial aspect of time series analysis, where data points
    are independent of time. Stationarity means that the statistical properties such as mean, variance, and
    autocorrelation are constant over time.

    ### Test Mechanism

    The Zivot-Andrews unit root test is performed on each feature in the dataset using the `ZivotAndrews` function from
    the `arch.unitroot` module. This function returns several metrics for each feature, including the statistical
    value, p-value (probability value), the number of lags used, and the number of observations. The p-value is used to
    decide on the null hypothesis (the time series has a unit root and is non-stationary) based on a chosen level of
    significance.

    ### Signs of High Risk

    - A high p-value suggests high risk, indicating insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, implying that
    the time series has a unit root and is non-stationary.
    - Non-stationary time series data can lead to misleading statistics and unreliable machine learning models.

    ### Strengths

    - Dynamically tests for stationarity against structural breaks in time series data, offering robust evaluation of
    stationarity in features.
    - Especially beneficial with financial, economic, or other time-series data where data observations lack a
    consistent pattern and structural breaks may occur.

    ### Limitations

    - Assumes data is derived from a single-equation, autoregressive model, making it less appropriate for multivariate
    time series data or data not aligning with this model.
    - May not account for unexpected shocks or changes in the series trend, both of which can significantly impact data
    stationarity.
