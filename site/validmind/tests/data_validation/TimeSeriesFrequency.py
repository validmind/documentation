def TimeSeriesFrequency(dataset: VMDataset):

    Evaluates consistency of time series data frequency and generates a frequency plot.

    ### Purpose

    The purpose of the TimeSeriesFrequency test is to evaluate the consistency in the frequency of data points in a
    time-series dataset. This test inspects the intervals or duration between each data point to determine if a fixed
    pattern (such as daily, weekly, or monthly) exists. The identification of such patterns is crucial to time-series
    analysis as any irregularities could lead to erroneous results and hinder the model's capacity for identifying
    trends and patterns.

    ### Test Mechanism

    Initially, the test checks if the dataframe index is in datetime format. Subsequently, it utilizes pandas'
    `infer_freq` method to identify the frequency of each data series within the dataframe. The `infer_freq` method
    attempts to establish the frequency of a time series and returns both the frequency string and a dictionary
    relating these strings to their respective labels. The test compares the frequencies of all datasets. If they share
    a common frequency, the test passes, but it fails if they do not. Additionally, Plotly is used to create a
    frequency plot, offering a visual depiction of the time differences between consecutive entries in the dataframe
    index.

    ### Signs of High Risk

    - The test fails, indicating multiple unique frequencies within the dataset. This failure could suggest irregular
    intervals between observations, potentially interrupting pattern recognition or trend analysis.
    - The presence of missing or null frequencies could be an indication of inconsistencies in data or gaps within the
    data collection process.

    ### Strengths

    - This test uses a systematic approach to checking the consistency of data frequency within a time-series dataset.
    - It increases the model's reliability by asserting the consistency of observations over time, an essential factor
    in time-series analysis.
    - The test generates a visual plot, providing an intuitive representation of the dataset's frequency distribution,
    which caters to visual learners and aids in interpretation and explanation.

    ### Limitations

    - This test is only applicable to time-series datasets and hence not suitable for other types of datasets.
    - The `infer_freq` method might not always correctly infer frequency when faced with missing or irregular data
    points.
    - Depending on context or the model under development, mixed frequencies might sometimes be acceptable, but this
    test considers them a failing condition.
