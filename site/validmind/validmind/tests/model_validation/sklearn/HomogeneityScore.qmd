Assesses clustering homogeneity by comparing true and predicted labels, scoring from 0 (heterogeneous) to 1 (homogeneous).

### Purpose

The Homogeneity Score encapsulated in this performance test is used to measure the homogeneity of the clusters formed by a machine learning model. In simple terms, a clustering result satisfies homogeneity if all of its clusters contain only points which are members of a single class.

### Test Mechanism

This test uses the `homogeneity_score` function from the `sklearn.metrics` library to compare the ground truth class labels of the training and testing sets with the labels predicted by the given model. The returned score is a metric of the clustering accuracy, and ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 denoting the highest possible degree of homogeneity.

### Signs of High Risk

- A score close to 0: This denotes that clusters are highly heterogenous and points within the same cluster might not belong to the same class.
- A significantly lower score for testing data compared to the score for training data: This can indicate overfitting, where the model has learned to perfectly match the training data but fails to perform well on unseen data.

### Strengths

- It provides a simple quantitative measure of the degree to which clusters contain points from only one class.
- Useful for validating clustering solutions where the ground truth — class membership of points — is known.
- It's agnostic to the absolute labels, and cares only that the points within the same cluster have the same class label.

### Limitations

- The Homogeneity Score is not useful for clustering solutions where the ground truth labels are not known.
- It doesn’t work well with differently sized clusters since it gives predominance to larger clusters.
- The score does not address the actual number of clusters formed, or the evenness of cluster sizes. It only checks the homogeneity within the given clusters created by the model.
