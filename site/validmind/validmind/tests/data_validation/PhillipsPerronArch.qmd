Assesses the stationarity of time series data in each feature of the ML model using the Phillips-Perron test.

### Purpose

The Phillips-Perron (PP) test is used to determine the stationarity of time series data for each feature in a dataset, which is crucial for forecasting tasks. It tests the null hypothesis that a time series is unit-root non-stationary. This is vital for understanding the stochastic behavior of the data and ensuring the robustness and validity of predictions generated by regression analysis models.

### Test Mechanism

The PP test is conducted for each feature in the dataset as follows:

- A data frame is created from the dataset.
- For each column, the Phillips-Perron method calculates the test statistic, p-value, lags used, and number of observations.
- The results are then stored for each feature, providing a metric that indicates the stationarity of the time series data.

### Signs of High Risk

- A high p-value, indicating that the series has a unit root and is non-stationary.
- Test statistic values exceeding critical values, suggesting non-stationarity.
- High 'usedlag' value, pointing towards autocorrelation issues that may degrade model performance.

### Strengths

- Resilience against heteroskedasticity in the error term.
- Effective for long time series data.
- Helps in determining whether the time series is stationary, aiding in the selection of suitable forecasting models.

### Limitations

- Applicable only within a univariate time series framework.
- Relies on asymptotic theory, which may reduce the test’s power for small sample sizes.
- Non-stationary time series must be converted to stationary series through differencing, potentially leading to loss of important data points.
