Tests dataset for duplicate entries, ensuring model reliability via data quality verification.

### Purpose

The 'Duplicates' test is designed to check for duplicate rows within the dataset provided to the model. It serves as a measure of data quality, ensuring that the model isn't merely memorizing duplicate entries or being swayed by redundant information. This is an important step in the pre-processing of data for both classification and regression tasks.

### Test Mechanism

This test operates by checking each row for duplicates in the dataset. If a text column is specified in the dataset, the test is conducted on this column; if not, the test is run on all feature columns. The number and percentage of duplicates are calculated and returned in a DataFrame. Additionally, a test is passed if the total count of duplicates falls below a specified minimum threshold.

### Signs of High Risk

- A high number of duplicate rows in the dataset, which can lead to overfitting where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.
- A high percentage of duplicate rows in the dataset, indicating potential problems with data collection or processing.

### Strengths

- Assists in improving the reliability of the model's training process by ensuring the training data is not contaminated with duplicate entries, which can distort statistical analyses.
- Provides both absolute numbers and percentage values of duplicate rows, giving a thorough overview of data quality.
- Highly customizable as it allows for setting a user-defined minimum threshold to determine if the test has been passed.

### Limitations

- Does not distinguish between benign duplicates (i.e., coincidental identical entries in different rows) and problematic duplicates originating from data collection or processing errors.
- The test becomes more computationally intensive as the size of the dataset increases, which might not be suitable for very large datasets.
- Can only check for exact duplicates and may miss semantically similar information packaged differently.
