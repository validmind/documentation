Assesses normality of dataset features in an ML model using the Jarque-Bera test.

### Purpose

The purpose of the Jarque-Bera test as implemented in this metric is to determine if the features in the dataset of a given Machine Learning model follow a normal distribution. This is crucial for understanding the distribution and behavior of the model's features, as numerous statistical methods assume normal distribution of the data.

### Test Mechanism

The test mechanism involves computing the Jarque-Bera statistic, p-value, skew, and kurtosis for each feature in the dataset. It utilizes the 'jarque_bera' function from the 'statsmodels' library in Python, storing the results in a dictionary. The test evaluates the skewness and kurtosis to ascertain whether the dataset follows a normal distribution. A significant p-value (typically less than 0.05) implies that the data does not possess normal distribution.

### Signs of High Risk

- A high Jarque-Bera statistic and a low p-value (usually less than 0.05) indicate high-risk conditions.
- Such results suggest the data significantly deviates from a normal distribution. If a machine learning model expects feature data to be normally distributed, these findings imply that it may not function as intended.

### Strengths

- Provides insights into the shape of the data distribution, helping determine whether a given set of data follows a normal distribution.
- Particularly useful for risk assessment for models that assume a normal distribution of data.
- By measuring skewness and kurtosis, it provides additional insights into the nature and magnitude of a distribution's deviation.

### Limitations

- Only checks for normality in the data distribution. It cannot provide insights into other types of distributions.
- Datasets that aren't normally distributed but follow some other distribution might lead to inaccurate risk assessments.
- Highly sensitive to large sample sizes, often rejecting the null hypothesis (that data is normally distributed) even for minor deviations in larger datasets.
