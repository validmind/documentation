Assesses the most frequent non-stopwords in a text column for identifying prevalent language patterns.

### Purpose

The CommonWords metric is used to identify and visualize the most prevalent words within a specified text column of a dataset. This provides insights into the prevalent language patterns and vocabulary, especially useful in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as text classification and text summarization.

### Test Mechanism

The test methodology involves splitting the specified text column's entries into words, collating them into a corpus, and then counting the frequency of each word using the Counter. The forty most frequently occurring non-stopwords are then visualized in an interactive bar chart using Plotly, where the x-axis represents the words, and the y-axis indicates their frequency of occurrence.

### Signs of High Risk

- A lack of distinct words within the list, or the most common words being stopwords.
- Frequent occurrence of irrelevant or inappropriate words could point out a poorly curated or noisy dataset.
- An error returned due to the absence of a valid Dataset object, indicating high risk as the metric cannot be effectively implemented without it.

### Strengths

- The metric provides clear insights into the language features – specifically word frequency – of unstructured text data.
- It can reveal prominent vocabulary and language patterns, which prove vital for feature extraction in NLP tasks.
- The interactive visualization helps in quickly capturing the patterns and understanding the data intuitively.

### Limitations

- The test disregards semantic or context-related information as it solely focuses on word frequency.
- It intentionally ignores stopwords, which might carry necessary significance in certain scenarios.
- The applicability is limited to English-language text data as English stopwords are used for filtering, hence cannot account for data in other languages.
- The metric requires a valid Dataset object, indicating a dependency condition that limits its broader applicability.
