### {{< var vm_framework >}} (v1.23.0)

<!--- NR the next three notebooks have been commented out as they are not ready to be released.--->
<!---[SC-2284] Support regression models by @AnilSorathiya in [#259](https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/259)--->
#### Support for regression models

The {{< var vm_framework >}} has added support for regression models. The updates include:

<!---- A new demo notebook featuring a simple regression model--->
- Addition of new metrics, `Errors` and `R-squared`, to support regression model evaluation
- Use of existing tabular dataset metrics for data validation

<!---[Try it ...](../../notebooks/code_samples/regression/quickstart_regression_full_suite.ipynb)--->

<!---[SC-2411] Clustering models support by @AnilSorathiya in [#271](https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/271)--->
#### Support for clustering models

The {{< var vm_framework >}} has added support for clustering models. The updates include:

<!---- A new demo notebook for a simple clustering model--->
- Addition of new metrics, `ClusterPerformanceMetrics`, `ClusterSizeDistribution`, `SilhouettePlot`, `HyperParametersTuning`, and `KMeansClustersOptimization`, to support clustering model evaluation 

<!---[Try it ...](../../notebooks/code_samples/clustering/quickstart_custer_demo.ipynb)--->

<!---John6797/sc 2416/embeddings models support by @johnwalz97 in [#272](https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/272)--->
#### Support for embeddings models

We added initial support for text embeddings models in the {{< var vm_framework >}} which enables you to create, use and test a BERT embeddings model utilizing the Hugging Face library. The updates include:

<!---- A new demo notebook--->
- A new folder in `model_validation` tests for embeddings, along with initial versions of tests for text embedding models
- Support for `feature_extraction` tasks in the Hugging Face model wrapper of the {{< var vm_framework >}}

### {{< var vm_platform >}} (v1.9.0)

<!---feat: Onboarding Guide by @gtagle in [#471](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/471)--->
#### New onboarding guide

To help you familiarize yourself with the features available in the ValidMind platform, a new onboarding guide is now available to all users:

![](onboarding-guide.png)

The onboarding guide tracks six common tasks that can be completed in almost any order:

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6}
- Get your ValidMind account
- Register your model
- Start on your model documentation
:::

::: {.g-col-6}
- Collaborate on your documentation
- Submit your model documentation
- Find guides & resources
:::

:::

You can hover over each task for more details. The guide can be minimized, leaving a trigger in the bottom right corner, or dismissed entirely. To reactivate the guide, go to **Settings** > **Profile**. 

<!---feat: New Model Inventory and Project Listing data-table display by @gtagle in [#468](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/468)--->

#### New model inventory and project listing display options

We've introduced new display options for search results in the **Model Inventory** and **Documentation Projects** pages: 

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6}
![](table-view.png)
:::

::: {.g-col-6}
![](card-view.png)
:::

:::

- Table view: Offers a detailed, structured layout that simplifies comparison.
- Card view: Provides a visual, summarized presentation.

You can easily switch between views using the **Display table** or **Display cards** toggle next to the search results.

## Documentation updates

### Enhanced test descriptions 
<!---Better test descriptions by @nrichers in [#144](https://github.com/validmind/documentation/pull/144)--->

We have improved the descriptions for tests available in the {{< var vm_framework >}}, together with a new landing page that allows for easy browsing of all tests. Additionally, our documentation site search now indexes these descriptions to make them easier to find. [Try it ...](../../../guide/test-descriptions.qmd)
