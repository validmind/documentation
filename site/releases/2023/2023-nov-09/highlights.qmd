![](onboarding-guide.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing the new platform UI onboarding guide"}

The onboarding guide tracks six common tasks that can be completed in almost any order:

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-50-ns}

- Get your ValidMind account
- Register your model
- Start on your model documentation

:::

::: {.w-50-ns}

- Collaborate on your documentation
- Submit your model documentation
- Find guides & resources

:::

::::

You can hover over each task for more details. The guide can be minimized, leaving a trigger in the bottom right corner, or dismissed entirely. To reactivate the guide, go to **{{< fa gear >}} Settings** > **Profile**. 

<!---feat: New Model Inventory and Project Listing data-table display by @gtagle in [#468](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/468)--->

#### New model inventory and project listing display options

We've introduced new display options for search results in the **Model Inventory** and **Documentation Projects** pages: 

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-50-ns}

![Table view](table-view.png){fig-alt="Model inventory table view"}

:::

::: {.w-50-ns}

![Card view](card-view.png){fig-alt="Model inventory card view"}

:::

::::

- **Table view:** Offers a detailed, structured layout that simplifies comparison.
- **Card view:** Provides a visual, summarized presentation.

You can easily switch between views using the **Display Table** or **Display Cards** toggle next to the search results.

## Documentation updates

### Enhanced test descriptions 
<!---Better test descriptions by @nrichers in [#144](https://github.com/validmind/documentation/pull/144)--->
