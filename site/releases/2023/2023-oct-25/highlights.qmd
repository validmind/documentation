## {{< fa bullhorn >}} Release highlights

<!-- ### {{< var validmind.developer >}} (v1.22.0) -->

<!--- NR the next three notebooks have been commented out as they are not ready to be released.--->
<!---[SC-2284] Support regression models by @AnilSorathiya in [#259](https://github.com/validmind/validmind-library/pull/259)
#### Support for regression models

The {{< var validmind.developer >}} has added support for regression models. The updates include:

- A new demo notebook featuring a simple regression model
- Utilization of the standard California housing tabular dataset for the demo
- Addition of new tests, `Errors` and `R-squared`, to support regression model evaluation
- Use of existing tabular dataset tests for data validation

<!---[SC-2411] Clustering models support by @AnilSorathiya in [#271](https://github.com/validmind/validmind-library/pull/271)
#### Support for clustering models

The {{< var validmind.developer >}} has added support for clustering models. The updates include:

- A new demo notebook for a simple clustering model 
- Utilization of a standard digits dataset for the demo
- Addition of new tests to support clustering model evaluation

[Try it ...](/notebooks/code_samples/clustering/quickstart_custer_demo.ipynb)--->

<!---John6797/sc 2416/embeddings models support by @johnwalz97 in [#272](https://github.com/validmind/validmind-library/pull/272)
#### Support for embeddings models

We added initial support for text embeddings models in the {{< var validmind.developer >}} which enables you to create, use and test a BERT embeddings model utilizing the Hugging Face library. The updates include:

- A new demo notebook
- A new folder in `model_validation` tests for embeddings, along with initial versions of tests for text embedding models
- Support for `feature_extraction` tasks in the Hugging Face model wrapper of the {{< var validmind.developer >}}
- Updated software dependencies

[Try it ...](/notebooks/POC/bert-embeddings-model-ow-poc.ipynb)--->

<!---[SC-2236] Demo notebook for changing config/parameters by @AnilSorathiya in [#251](https://github.com/validmind/validmind-library/pull/251)--->
<!-- #### New notebook to demonstrate how to change configuration parameters

This notebook serves as a guide for modifying configuration and parameters within the {{< var validmind.developer >}}. It includes the following features:

- A preview template allowing users to select a sample test for configuration
- Instructions on how to pass custom configurations to `run_documentation_tests()`
- An option to run documentation tests focused on a specific section, avoiding the need to run the entire template

[Try it ...](/notebooks/how_to/configure_test_parameters.ipynb) -->

### {{< var validmind.platform >}} (v1.8.0)

<!---Feature: Remove block from documentation by @gtagle in [#467](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/467)--->
#### Remove blocks from documentation

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-40-ns}
You can now remove blocks of text or test-related content from model documentation in the editor of the {{< var vm.platform >}}. 

- This new feature gives you more control over your documentation and enables you to remove content that is no longer needed.
- To remove text blocks and test-driven blocks from model documentation, you first select the block you want to remove and click {{< fa trash-can >}}, either in the text-block's toolbar or in the test-driven's block single-button toolbar.

<!--- NR I don't think we have any user-facing docs for this feature ... 
  [Try it ...]()--->

<!---feat: Add settings landing page by @wkm97 in [#466](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/466)--->
#### New {{< fa gear >}} Settings landing page

A new **{{< fa gear >}} Settings** landing page now organizes more of your settings for the {{< var validmind.platform >}} in one convenient place.

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-40-ns}
From this page you can manage:

- Your organization, including the name and the API and secret key you use to connect to the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.
- The documentation templates that standardize the documentation table of contents for your projects and configure the required validation tests for specific model use cases.
- Workflows that determine the statuses of your model and how it transitions through your model risk management process according to your requirements.

## Enhancements

### {{< var validmind.developer >}} (v1.22.0)

<!---[SC-2346] Rouge and Bert score tests should show average scores by @juanmleng in [#263](https://github.com/validmind/validmind-library/pull/263)--->
#### Rouge and Bert Score tests now show average scores

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-80-ns}
- Introduced `RougeMetricsAggregate` and `BertScoreAggregate` to offer a high-level overview of model performance across a large number of text rows. 
- These tests complement the detailed row-by-row analysis provided by `RougeScore` and `BertScore`.

<!---[SC-2143] Tests for safety toxicity and bias in text summarization by @juanmleng in [#258](https://github.com/validmind/validmind-library/pull/258)--->
#### Tests for safety toxicity and bias in text summarization

We introduced several new tests to evaluate safety and bias risks in text summarization:

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-70-ns}
- `ToxicityScore`: Measures safety risk
- `ToxicityHistogram`: Provides a distribution of safety risk scores
- `RegardScore`: Evaluates bias risk
- `RegardHistogram`: Shows distribution of bias risk scores

## Bug fixes

### {{< var validmind.developer >}} (v1.22.0)

<!---[SC-2303] Shap test issue resolved by @juanmleng in [#262](https://github.com/validmind/validmind-library/pull/262)--->
#### Shap test issue resolved
- We set `matplotlib` to version `3.7.x` in `pyproject.toml` to fix an incompatibility with the latest `matplotlib` version (`3.8.0`). 
- This incompatibility was causing SHAP plot errors. We will keep track of `matplotlib` releases for future updates. Once fixed, we will consider updating the version.
