## Bug fixes 

### {{< var validmind.platform >}} (v1.10.0)

<!---Makes author's name contextual to currently logged user by @gtagle in [#492](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/492)--->
#### Contextualized references to the current user
We fixed an issue where activity logs indicated user references out of context, displaying the current user's full name instead of referring to them as "you".

<!---Respect width/height when available by @cachafla in [#498](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/498)--->
#### Respect width and height for plots when available
We fixed an issue where some plots were being cut off due to having more height than available in the current viewport. This issue was fixed by respecting the plot's original defined height instead of setting a maximum pre-configured height on the frontend.

## Documentation

### Site enhancements

<!---Remove safe external dependencies by @nrichers in [#147](https://github.com/validmind/documentation/pull/147)--->
#### Removed safe external dependencies

To improve loading times and reduce the reliance on being connected to the internet, we removed some external dependencies for our docs site:

- Fonts are now stored and imported locally
- Some unneeded font references in our template schema docs have been removed
