<!---John6797/sc 1980/metric test class dx improvements by @johnwalz97 in [#220](https://github.com/validmind/validmind-python/pull/220)--->
- **Improved developer experience for the Metric test class**. We made a number of enhancements to the {{< var validmind.developer >}} to improve the experience for developers:

   * **Better test organization**: Added a `metadata` and `tags` attribute to the `Test` base class for better categorization and filtering of tests.
   * **Better filtering**: Added a new `task_type` argument to the `list_tests()` function to allow simple filtering by `task_type` set in a test.
   * **Clearer naming**: Renamed `required_context` to `required_inputs` across the whole ValidMind SDK.

<!---feat: [sc-1862] User should have a way to discover required context and default config when running tests by @johnwalz97 in [#204](https://github.com/validmind/validmind-python/pull/204)--->
- **Enhancements to test configuration discovery**: To make the discovery of required context and default configuration easier, this update includes a number of changes to how `required_context` and `default_parameters` are presented:
   * **Preview template expansion**: With `vm.preview_template()`, you can now view detailed, expandable information for each content block driven by a test. This includes the test's name, description, required context, and default parameters.
   * **Simplified test listing**: The `vm.tests.list_tests()` function has been refined to show only the `ID`, `Name`, and `Description` for each test, making it more user-friendly.
   * **Detailed test descriptions**: You can now obtain complete test details, including `required_context` and `default_params`, using the `vm.tests.describe_test()` function.
   * **Retrieve test suite**: The new function `vm.get_test_suite()` allows you to access a specific test suite instance via the high-level ValidMind API.
   * **Access to default configuration**: A new method, `get_default_config()`, is now part of both the TestPlan and TestSuite classes, letting you obtain a dictionary containing all the configuration parameters used by the tests.
   * **Easier required context**: A complementary new method, `get_required_context()`, now returns a list of all the context variables needed for tests to run, making it easier for you to ensure that everything is set up correctly.

### {{< var validmind.platform >}} (v1.4.10)

<!---Release 1.4.7 by @cachafla in [#444](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/444)--->
**Redesigned application and navigation bar layout**. The new application design offers a cleaner, more intuitive interface that enhances user experience. The updated navigation bar layout specifically contributes to easier navigation, allowing users to find what they need with greater efficiency.
