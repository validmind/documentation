## {{< fa bullhorn >}} Release highlights

### {{< var validmind.developer >}} (v1.16.0)

<!--- NR commented out as per Andres' request --->
<!---
- **Support for Credit Risk Scorecard and Probability of Default use cases**. We've enhanced our {{< var vm.developer >}} to be more versatile than ever, so you can now document and validate more model use cases. To demonstrate how you can use {{< var vm.product >}} with these new use cases, we're providing two new interactive Jupyter Notebooks for a hands-on experience. Try them:
    
    - [Credit Risk Scorecard Demo](/notebooks/probability_of_default/credit_risk_scorecard_demo.ipynb)
    - [Probability of Default Model](/notebooks/probability_of_default/probability_of_default_validmind.ipynb)
--->

#### Updated notebook for NLP use case

Now with enhanced performance by using CatBoost compared to the original PyTorch-based notebook, this updated notebook showcases natural language processing (NLP) data analysis and text classification using the {{< var validmind.developer >}} with emphasis on the in-depth analysis and preprocessing of COVID-19 tweets. <!---[Try it ...](/notebooks/code_samples/nlp_and_llm/nlp_sentiment_analysis_catboost_demo.ipynb)--->

#### Improved developer experience when you encounter error conditions

- Unhandled errors now return an error code with a more descriptive message that can help you with looking them up in the troubleshooting section of our documentation. 
- We also improved error handling when tests fail to run and the test results summary widget now display error information for each test that fails to run. 

### {{< var validmind.platform >}} (v1.4.1)

#### New full-featured text editor

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-70-ns}
When collaborating on model documentation in the {{< var vm.platform >}} with others, you now have a new text editor at your disposal. 

:::

::: {.w-30-ns}
[Collaborate with others](/guide/model-documentation/collaborate-with-others.qmd){.button .button-green}

:::

::::

- The interface should be intuitive and familiar, allowing you to manage model documentation and validation reports with greater ease. 
- In addition to the new editing features, you can use the editor to participate in comment threads, track changes, see the revision history, enter math formulas, and more.

#### Add new content blocks to model documentation

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-70-ns}
You can now add new sections to existing model documentation, providing additional space for text and test results â€” simply by hovering over the dashed line between sections. 

:::

::: {.w-30-ns}
[Work with content blocks](/guide/model-documentation/work-with-content-blocks.qmd){.button .button-green}

:::

::::

Supported content block types:

- **Simple text block:** Can be added anywhere on model documentation pages and edited to include additional documentation in text format.
- **Test-driven block:** Can be added to display one of the supported test results collected by the {{< var vm.developer >}}.

<!--- TO DO Need Swap template docs --->

#### Swap templates for model documentation

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-60-ns}
We've now enhanced the flexibility of documenting models by allowing you to swap documentation templates.

:::

::: {.w-40-ns}
[Swap documentation templates](/guide/templates/swap-documentation-templates.qmd){.button .button-green}

:::

::::

- Seamlessly update existing model documentation by either switching to an entirely different template or by simply upgrading to a more recent version of the template currently in use. 
- The ability to swap templates ensures that your model documentation remains up-to-date and aligns with your latest preferred template without the need to start from scratch.

#### {{< var validmind.platform >}} enhancements

<!-- This rename required a docs update, included in this PR -->
- **Renamed Client Integration page to {{< fa rocket >}} Getting Started**. To better reflect when you use the credentials to generate model documentation with the {{< var validmind.developer >}}, we have renamed the **Client Integration** page to **{{< fa rocket >}} Getting Started**. 
- **Improved activity widget.** We enhanced the user interface with new tabs, enabling you to filter events based on activity type.
- **Improved Findings section and Findings Details page.** We made enhancements to the {{< var validmind.platform >}} for both model findings and the findings details sections for a better look and feel.
- **Refined Models and Projects lists.**  We refined the user interface, featuring more intuitive default sorting and more user-friendly filtering.
