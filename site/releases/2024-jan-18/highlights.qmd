We continue to make easier to set up and administer ValidMind for members in your organization. In this release, we are introducing new user and group management features that are available right in the {{< var vm.platform >}}.

The new **user management** features are available under **{{< fa gear >}} Settings** \> **{{< fa book-open >}} User Directory**:

These features enable you to:

-   Invite members of your organization by email
-   Display pending user invitations
-   Get notifications for successful or failed user invitations

Try it in the {{< var vm.platform >}}: [User directory]({{< var url.us1 >}}/settings/user-directory)

The new **group management** features are available under **{{< fa gear >}} Settings** \> **Groups**:

<img src="group-management.gif" alt="Managing groups under Settings &gt; Groups" style="width: 90%; border: 4px solid #333; box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px #ccc, -5px 5px 5px #ccc; border-radius: 5px;"/>

These features enable you to:

-   Assign permissions for multiple users at once
-   View existing group members
-   Add or remove group members

Try it in the {{< var vm.platform >}}: [Groups]({{< var url.us1 >}}/settings/groups)

#### Template management

<!---Template detail page by [@panchicore](https://github.com/panchicore) in [#491](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/491)--->

New template management features, available under **{{< fa gear >}} Settings** \> **Templates**, enable you to work with templates more efficiently:

<img src="template-pages.gif" alt="Template pages available under Settings &gt; Templates" style="width: 90%; border: 4px solid #333; box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px #ccc, -5px 5px 5px #ccc; border-radius: 5px;"/>

You use these new template management features to:

-   See which models use which template, and which version of that template.
-   Navigate from templates to models.
-   Get direct links for templates that you can share with others.
-   Navigate templates more easily by outline sections that you can expand instead of having to parse JSON code.
-   Edit templates to create a new template versions with a visual comparison of the differences.
-   Duplicate templates and modify them in order to create additional templates for your use cases.

Try it in the {{< var validmind.platform >}}: [Templates]({{< var url.us1 >}}/settings/templates)

## Enhancements

<!--- https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/522 - groups stakeholders into types--->

-   **Stakeholder roles for projects**: To simplify the identification of roles that stakeholders hold for model documentation, stakeholders are now categorized by role type. This includes groupings for **Owners**, **Developers**, and **Validators**.

<!---Upgrade kbar by @cachafla in [#511](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/511)--->

-   **Upgraded search experience**. We've updated the component in our web application responsible for the search command bar interface. The new version brings enhanced search performance, particularly for multi-word queries.

## Bug fixes

<!---Fixes text highlighting when there's a comment by [@gtagle](https://github.com/gtagle) in [#519](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/519)--->

-   **Text highlighting for comments**. We fixed text highlighting associated with comments so that text is more legible in both light and dark themes. Additionally, we fixed the divider background on AI content generation and made some changes to empty text block contents.

<!---Cachafla/sc 2655/fix displaying dynamic index in template by @cachafla in [#514](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/514)--->

-   **Dynamic index display in templates**. We fixed an issue where the internal `order` and `index` properties were incorrectly exposed in the template editor. These properties have no effect during template editing as they are dynamically generated. The fix now prevents these properties from being saved back to the template.

<!---Allow clicking on activities related to dynamic text blocks by @cachafla in [#501](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/501)--->

-   **Activity links now redirect users to the relevant section**. We fixed an issue where clicking on recent activity items related to comments or test descriptions inside a test- driven block would take the user to a non-existent page. This functionality has been corrected by redirecting the user to the section that a content block belongs to.

<!---Cachafla/sc 2635/issues with search functionality by @cachafla in [#507](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/507)--->

-   **Search experience fixes**. We implemented multiple fixes to the search functionality in the {{< var vm.platform >}}:

    -   Linking from recent activity items has been corrected to ensure accurate navigation.
    -   Routing to documentation pages when a search result is associated with text in a test-driven block now works as expected.
    -   Search now excludes results for `content_id` that are no longer part of the documentation.
    -   Search functionality is now available from project overview pages. Previously, search only worked when invoked from documentation pages.

<!---Fix issues with user picker by @cachafla in [#523](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/523)--->

-   **Issues with the user selection component**. We fixed the following UI/UX issues with the user picker interface component:

    -   Clicking on **X** now properly clears the current search input and dismisses the user list.
    -   Clicking on **Cancel** now properly clears out any unsaved users from the list.
    -   Entering text now correctly filters users that match the search criteria.
    -   A new 'micro search' utility improves user matching.

    Additionally, we updated the business unit selector component to be a simple dropdown.

<!---Cachafla/sc 2646/status updates on dashboard disappearing by @cachafla in [#513](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/513)--->

-   **Disappearing status updates on dashboard**. We fixed an issue where the **Recent Activity** widget would become unavailable when clicking on **Status updates**. We now show an empty state element when there is no data to show.
