### Manage validation guidelines

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-50-ns}
We've expanded on our risk area functionality and added a new page to your Workplace Settings: **Risk Areas & Validation Guidelines**.

This replaces the old Risk Areas set up under **Organization**, and allows you to customize guidelines associated with your model validation templates.

<form method="get" action="/guide/model-validation/manage-validation-guidelines.html" target="_blank">
   <button type="submit" style="color: white; background-color: #de257e; border-radius: 8px; border: none; font-size: 16px; padding: 6.25px 12.5px; margin-left: 16px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Learn more...</button>
</form>

## Enhancements

### Model inventory fields

Previously, we used custom fields to refer to your organization's unique additional fields for models as well as the default fields provided as suggestions by ValidMind. Custom fields has been renamed to model inventory fields, capturing all additional fields, and the terminology standardized across the {{< var validmind.platform >}} and our documentation.

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-70-ns}
You can still require additional fields to be provided upon model registration, and work with a number of different types of fields.

Renamed statuses to model lifecycle status
 
Generated PR summary: 
 
This update changes the terminology in various UI components from 'Statuses' to 'Model Lifecycle Statuses' to enhance clarity and consistency. You will notice updates in several areas, including modal headers and error messages within `AddStatusModal`. The label for the statuses section in the `SettingsSidebar` also reflects the new terminology. On the `Status` page, button labels, empty state messages, and headings are updated. Similarly, on the `StatusesWorkflows` page, titles and descriptive text are revised. Additionally, setting link titles and descriptions have been updated on the `Settings` page. These adjustments aim to provide a more consistent user experience when managing model lifecycle statuses across the application.

## Bug fixes

PR #910: fix template editor showing multiorg roles
URL: https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/910
Labels: bug

### Multi-organizational roles display issue 
N/A
 
Generated PR summary: 
 
This update enhances role and permission handling within the `Template` component in the `Settings/Templates/Template/index.tsx` file. The modifications include an updated `TUserRole` type in `src/models/role.ts` to incorporate a new `scope` field. Additionally, the `Template` component now uses the `currentOrganization` from the `UsersContext`. The roles displayed for both the template's current version and selected version are now filtered based on the `currentOrganization`'s `cuid`, improving the accuracy and relevance of role-related information presented in the component.
