We've expanded on our risk area functionality and added a new page to your Workplace Settings: **{{< fa align-left >}} Risk Areas & Validation Guidelines**.

This replaces the old Risk Areas set up under **{{< fa building-columns >}} Organization**, and allows you to customize guidelines associated with your model validation templates.

## Enhancements

### Model inventory fields

Previously, we used custom fields to refer to your organization's unique additional fields for models as well as the default fields provided as suggestions by {{< var vm.product >}}. Custom fields has been renamed to model inventory fields, capturing all additional fields, and the terminology standardized across the {{< var validmind.platform >}} and our documentation.

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-70-ns}
You can still require additional fields to be provided upon model registration, and work with a number of different types of fields.

### Model lifecyle statuses

Previously, we used resource statuses to refer to the model stages made available for use in your model workflows. Resource statuses has been renamed to model lifecycle statuses, clarifying their function, and the terminology standardized across the {{< var validmind.platform >}} and our documentation.

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-60-ns}
- Default statuses are provided for you as suggestions. 
- You can add, edit, remove, and define your own custom statuses.

<!-- ### Multi-organizational roles display issue 

Previously, for users that belonged to multiple organizations, there was a display issue in the {{< var vm.platform >}} where your user roles from other organizations other than your actively selected organization were shown. 

Now only your roles from your actively selected organization are displayed, reducing confusion around access permissions. -->
