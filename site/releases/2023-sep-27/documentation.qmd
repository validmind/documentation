<!---User journey improvements by @nrichers in [#128](https://github.com/validmind/documentation/pull/128)--->
- **User journey improvements**. We enhanced the architecture and content of our external docs site to make the user journey more efficient for model developers and model validators who are new to our products:
   
   * **Reworked the "Get Started" section** to include more conceptual information and an overview of the high-level workflows. [Try it ...](../../guide/get-started.qmd)
   * **Revised the "Developer Framework"** section to provide an end-to-end overview of the workflow that model developers should follow as they adopt the framework.  [Try it ...](../../guide/get-started-developer-framework.qmd)

<!---Docs site improvements by @nrichers in [#132](https://github.com/validmind/documentation/pull/132)--->
- **Docs site improvements**. We made a number of incremental improvements to our user guide:

   - **New dropdown for the Developer Framework** that gives faster access to the most important bits, such as our code samples and the reference documentation.

   - **Publication date** for each page that reflects the last time the source file was touched.
   - Previous and next topic footers** for related topics that make it easier to keep reading.
   - **Expanded overview** for key ValidMind concepts with some additional information.
   - **Lighter background for diagrams** that improves legibility.
