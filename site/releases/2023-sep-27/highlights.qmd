## Release highlights

In this release, we've added support for large language models (LLMs) to enhance the capabilities of the ValidMind Developer Framework in preparation for the [closed beta](https://validmind.com/announcing-validminds-closed-beta-coming-soon/), along with a number of new demo notebooks that you can try out. Other enhancements provide improvements for the developer experience and with our documentation site.

## ValidMind Developer Framework (v1.19.0)

<!---John6797/sc 2062/sentiment analysis demo notebook should support by @johnwalz97 in [#224](https://github.com/validmind/validmind-python/pull/224)--->
### Large language model (LLM) support

We added initial support for large language models (LLMs) in ValidMind via the new `FoundationModel` class. You can now create an instance of a `FoundationModel` and specify `predict_fn` and a `prompt`, and pass that into any test suite, for example. The `predict_fn` must be defined by the user and implements the logic for calling the Foundation LLM, usually via the API.

To demonstrate the capabilities of LLM support, this release also includes new demo notebooks: 

<!---John6797/sc 2088/implement prompt validation metrics poc by @johnwalz97 in [#232](https://github.com/validmind/validmind-python/pull/232)--->
- **Prompt validation demo notebook for LLMs**. As a proof of concept, we added initial native prompt validation tests to the developer framework, including a notebook and simple template to test out these metrics on a sentiment analysis LLM model we built.

<!---[SC-2216] Implement demo notebook for summarization model using LLMs by @cachafla in [#242](https://github.com/validmind/validmind-python/pull/242)--->
<!---[SC-2144] Support hugging face summarization models by @AnilSorathiya in [#238](https://github.com/validmind/validmind-python/pull/238)--->
- **Text summarization model demo notebook for LLMs**. We added a new notebook in the developer framework that includes the financial news dataset, initializes a Hugging Face summarization model using the `init_model` interface, implements relevant metrics for testing, and demonstrates how to run a _text summarization metrics_ test suite for an LLM instructed as a financial news summarizer.

<!---SC-2061: Support hugging face models by @AnilSorathiya in [#222](https://github.com/validmind/validmind-python/pull/222)--->
### Support for Hugging Face models

ValidMind can now validate pre-trained models from the HuggingFace Hub, including any language model compatible with the HF transformers API. 

To illustrate this new feature, we have included a **financial news sentiment analysis demo** that runs documentation tests for a Hugging Face model with text classification using the [financial_phrasebank](https://huggingface.co/datasets/financial_phrasebank). [Try it ...](../../notebooks/code_samples/LLM_and_NLP/hugging_face_integration_demo.ipynb)

<!---[SC-1956] Credit risk scorecard demo notebooks by @juanmleng in [#223](https://github.com/validmind/validmind-python/pull/223)--->
<!--- NR As per Andres, these notebooks need to be updated before they can be shared again
### New credit risk scorecard demo notebooks 

We added new demo notebooks and supporting files for very popular financial services model use cases:

  - Developing credit risk scorecards. [Try it ...](../../notebooks/code_samples/probability_of_default/credit_risk_scorecard_development_demo.ipynb)
  - Validating credit risk scorecards. [Try it ...](../../notebooks/code_samples/probability_of_default/credit_risk_scorecard_validation_demo.ipynb)
 --->

### A better developer experience with `run_test`

We added a new `run_test` helper function that streamlines running tests for you. This function allows executing any individual test independent of a test suite or a documentation template. A one-line command can execute a test, making it easier to run tests with various parameters and options. For example:

```python
run_test("ClassImbalance", dataset=dataset, params=params, send=True)
```

<!---Add new `run_test` helper function by @cachafla in [#243](https://github.com/validmind/validmind-python/pull/243)--->
We also updated the QuickStart notebook to have a consistent experience: [Try it ...](../../notebooks/quickstart_customer_churn_full_suite.ipynb)

This notebook:

- Now runs `vm.preview_template()` after initializing ValidMind
- Now runs `vm.run_documentation_tests()` instead of running a test suite that is not connected to the template

#### Example usage for `run_test`

Discover existing tests by calling `list_tests()` or `describe_test()`:

`list_tests()`:

![](270865082-d85821f7-f43c-40fb-a68c-96d9a0e6cfe2.png)

`describe_test()`:

![](270865181-839c0bf1-898a-452d-8025-85534cc5ad7d.png)

View the tests associated with a documentation template by running `preview_template()`:

![](270865328-67488af6-0f19-4d81-bf50-3dc95d0fb305.png)

 Using the test ID, run a given test and pass in additional configuration parameters and inputs:

```python
# No params
test_results = vm.tests.run_test(
    "class_imbalance",
    dataset=vm_dataset
)

# Custom params
test_results = vm.tests.run_test(
    "class_imbalance",
    params={"min_percent_threshold": 30},
    dataset=vm_dataset
)
```
Output:
![](270865561-e202c0fb-ca90-4ab2-ba88-e2e524b32ff0.png)

Send the results of the test to ValidMind by calling `.log()`:

```python
test_results.log()
```

## Enhancements

<!---[SC-2108] Multi-class tests should report metrics for individual classes and many other changes by @cachafla in [#228](https://github.com/validmind/validmind-python/pull/228)--->

- **Multi-class test improvements**. We made a number of changes to metrics to improve the developer experience:
   - A new `fail_fast` argument can be passed to `run_test_plan`, `run_test_suite` and `run_documentation_tests`, used to fail and raise an exception on the first error encountered. This change is useful for debugging.
   - `ClassifierPerformance` test now determines if you are testing a binary or a multi-class model. When testing a multi-class model, we now report additional per-class, macro and weighted average metrics.
   - Fixed F1 score metric so it works correctly  for binary and multi-class models.

<!---SC-2042: Add multi-class classification support by @AnilSorathiya in [#221](https://github.com/validmind/validmind-python/pull/221)--->
- **Added multi-class classification support**. The developer framework now supports a multi-class version of some the existing metrics, such as confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and more. Also, the dataset and model interfaces now support dealing with multiple targets.

<!---SC-2100: Implement classification model comparison metrics by @AnilSorathiya in [#231](https://github.com/validmind/validmind-python/pull/231)--->
- **Implemented classification model comparison metrics**. Added a model performance comparison test for classification tasks. The test includes metrics such as accuracy, F1, precision, recall, and roc_auc score.

<!---John6797/sc 1790/framework should track additional test metadata by @johnwalz97 in [#239](https://github.com/validmind/validmind-python/pull/239)--->
- **Track additional test metadata**. Added a `metadata` property to every ValidMind test class. The `metadata` property includes a `task_types` field and a `tags` field which both serve to categorize the tests based on what data and model types they work with, what category of test they fall into, and more.

<!---feat: [sc-2196] Users should be able to filter tests by task type and tags by @johnwalz97 in [#241](https://github.com/validmind/validmind-python/pull/241)--->
- **Filter tests by task type and tags**. We added a new search feature to the `validmind.tests.list_tests` function to allow for better test discoverability. The `list_tests` function in the `tests` module now supports the following arguments:
   
   * `filter`: If set, will match tests by ID, task_types or tags using a combination of substring and fuzzy string matching. Defaults to `None`. 
   * `task`: If set, will further narrow matching tests (assuming `filter` has been passed) by exact matching the `task` to the test's `task_type` metadata. Defaults to `None`. 
   * `tags`: If a list is passed, will again narrow the matched tests by exact matching on tags. Defaults to `None`. 

## Documentation updates

<!---User journey improvements by @nrichers in [#128](https://github.com/validmind/documentation/pull/128)--->
- **User journey improvements**. We enhanced the architecture and content of our external docs site to make the user journey more efficient for model developers and model validators who are new to our products:
   
   * **Reworked the "Get Started" section** to include more conceptual information and an overview of the high-level workflows. [Try it ...](../../guide/get-started.qmd)
   * **Revised the "Developer Framework"** section to provide an end-to-end overview of the workflow that model developers should follow as they adopt the framework.  [Try it ...](../../guide/get-started-developer-framework.qmd)

<!---Docs site improvements by @nrichers in [#132](https://github.com/validmind/documentation/pull/132)--->
- **Docs site improvements**. We made a number of incremental improvements to our user guide:

   - **New dropdown for the developer framework** that gives faster access to the most important bits, such as our code samples and the reference documentation.
   
      ![](developer-framework-dropdown.gif)

   - **Publication date** for each page that reflects the last time the source file was touched.
   - Previous and next topic footers** for related topics that make it easier to keep reading.
   - **Expanded overview** for key ValidMind concepts with some additional information.
   - **Lighter background for diagrams** that improves legibility.
