## Bug fixes

### {{< var validmind.platform >}} (v1.11.0)

<!---Fixes text highlighting when there's a comment by [@gtagle](https://github.com/gtagle) in [#519](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/519)--->

#### Text highlighting for comments 

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-80-ns}

- We fixed text highlighting associated with comments so that text is more legible in both light and dark themes. 
- Additionally, we fixed the divider background on AI content generation and made some changes to empty text block contents.

<!---Cachafla/sc 2655/fix displaying dynamic index in template by @cachafla in [#514](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/514)--->

#### Dynamic index display in templates

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-60-ns}
- We fixed an issue where the internal `order` and `index` properties were incorrectly exposed in the template editor. 
- These properties have no effect during template editing as they are dynamically generated. The fix now prevents these properties from being saved back to the template.

<!---Allow clicking on activities related to dynamic text blocks by @cachafla in [#501](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/501)--->

#### Activity links now redirect to the relevant section
:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-75-ns}
- We fixed an issue where clicking on activity items related to comments or test descriptions inside a test-driven block would take the user to a non-existent page. 
- This functionality has been corrected by redirecting the user to the section that a content block belongs to.

<!---Cachafla/sc 2635/issues with search functionality by @cachafla in [#507](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/507)--->

#### Search experience fixes
We implemented multiple fixes to the search functionality in the {{< var vm.platform >}}:

- Linking from activity items has been corrected to ensure accurate navigation.
- Routing to documentation pages when a search result is associated with text in a test-driven block now works as expected.
- Search now excludes results for `content_id` that are no longer part of the documentation.
- Search functionality is now available from project overview pages. Previously, search only worked when invoked from documentation pages.

<!---Fix issues with user picker by @cachafla in [#523](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/523)--->

#### Issues with the user selection component
We fixed the following UI/UX issues with the user picker interface component:

- Clicking on **X** now properly clears the current search input and dismisses the user list.
- Clicking on **Cancel** now properly clears out any unsaved users from the list.
- Entering text now correctly filters users that match the search criteria.
- A new 'micro search' utility improves user matching.

Additionally, we updated the business unit selector component to be a simple dropdown.

<!---Cachafla/sc 2646/status updates on dashboard disappearing by @cachafla in [#513](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/513)--->

#### Disappearing status updates on Document Overview
:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-70-ns}
- We fixed an issue where the Recent Activity section would become unavailable when clicking on **Status Updates**. 
- We now show an empty state element when there is no data to show.
