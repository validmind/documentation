::: {.w-40-ns}

##### {{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Findings

![New {{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Findings page with a table of clickable findings](model-findings-page.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the new Findings page showing a table of findings that can be clicked on" .screenshot}

The new **{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Findings** page allows you to efficiently track all findings flagged during model validation, such as major and minor issues, deficiencies, model limitations, or other concerns that must be addressed. 

To facilitate working with findings across all models undergoing validation in your organization, you can filter and view findings by specific criteria, including:

- Inventory model
- Severity 
- Status
- Risk area
- Assignee
- Due date

![New {{< fa square-poll-vertical >}} Analytics page with clickable bar chart tiles](reports-page.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the new Reports page showing several tiles with bar charts that can be clicked on" .screenshot}

The new **{{< fa square-poll-vertical >}} Analytics** page provides quick insights into your model validation efforts to ensure effective oversight and management of model-related risks. 

Analytical reports are grouped into bar charts for different types of findings, including:

- Findings by risk area
- Findings by business unit
- Findings by status
- Findings by model

Additionally, you can seamlessly navigate between the **{{< fa square-poll-vertical >}} Analytics** page and relevant model findings by selecting information from the available bar charts to drill down into specific areas of concern.

These improvements enable you to manage collections of users at the organization or team level with similar roles or permissions more effectively.

##### User invitation history

We also made improvements to how the invitation history gets displayed when you add new users to your organization:

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-40-ns}
- Added an **Invite History** table to show accepted invitations
- Renamed the existing table to **Pending Invites** and updated it to show only users that have not yet accepted

Combined, these changes make it easier to see both pending and accepted invitations for new users joining your organization.

## Enhancements

### {{< var validmind.platform >}} (v1.18.4)

<!---[SC-3255] adding SSO login option to auth flow by @jamadriz in [#579](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/579)--->

#### Added SSO login option to auth flow

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-70-ns}
We introduced the option to log in to {{< var vm.product >}} using SSO. 

:::

::: {.w-30-ns .tl}

[Log in to {{< var vm.product >}}](/guide/configuration/log-in-to-validmind.qmd){.button}

:::

::::

Single sign on (SSO) allows your enterprise organizations to have a centralized authentication mechanism, more integrated control over internal applications, and integration with existing identity management systems, such as Google Workspace, LDAP or Active Directory.

In order for this feature to be enabled for your organization, we can configure our Auth0 authentication provider to integrate with your organization's identity provider. The steps required to make SSO available include:

1. Creating an Auth0 Enterprise SAML connection to your organization's identity provider
2. Configuring your organizations identity provider and adding a new SSO application for {{< var vm.product >}}
3. Enabling SSO on the {{< var vm.product >}} backend by associating the domain and the Auth0 SAML connection with your organization

<!--- NR Commented out as per Slack convo with Andres
Apply changes from juan5508/sc-3259/Create-Metric-V2-class
: This pull request introduces the Unit Metric feature, a new single value measure designed to streamline the risk assessment process in Machine Learning and AI model development. The Unit Metric simplifies complex evidence into actionable insights, allowing for efficient monitoring and comparison of risks across different models or datasets.

Example: 
```python
metric_id = "validmind.unit_metrics.sklearn.classification.F1"

inputs = {
    "model": vm_model,
    "dataset": vm_test_ds
}

result = vm.unit_metrics.run_metric(
    metric_id=metric_id, 
    inputs=inputs,
)
result.value
```
```python
>>> 0.5709401709401709
```
```python
result.summary
```
```python
>>> {'f1': 0.5709401709401709}
```

**Changes**
- Implemented the `UnitMetric` class.
- Implemented sklearn classification metrics as unit metrics: `F1`, `Accuracy`, `Precision`, `Recall` and `ROC_AUC`
- Added `vm.unit_metrics.run_metric` to the ValidMind Library to support running metrics. 

**Testing**
- Provided a notebook on defining, executing, and extracting results from Unit Metrics using a customer churn use case. See `run_unit_metrics.ipynb`

<!---Panchicore/sc 3001/remove documentation projects from the UI by @panchicore in [#569](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/569)--->

#### Removed documentation projects from the UI

Documentation projects have been removed from the {{< var validmind.platform >}}, streamlining navigation for accessing model documentation. You can now easily locate a model of interest and then access its documentation or validation report directly within the context of that model. 

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-60-ns}
- This change aims to improve navigation by providing you with a single entry point from the **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory** page.
