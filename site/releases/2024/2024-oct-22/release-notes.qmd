### Support for ongoing monitoring

Monitoring is a critical component of model risk management, as emphasized in regulations such as SR 11-7, SS1/23, and E-24. With this release of {{< var vm.product >}}, we officially support ongoing monitoring. You can enable this feature for both existing and new models.

![Ongoing monitoring of a model](/releases/2024/2024-oct-22/358433496-02a6d5b9-0521-4110-b45c-b91e06798a97.png){fig-alt="An image showing some ongoing monitoring data on the ValidMind Platform" .screenshot}

Scenarios where ongoing monitoring is warranted:

- Pre-approval monitoring of new models
- Monitoring during significant updates
- Post-production monitoring

The monitoring template for your model automatically populates with data as your code runs, providing a comprehensive view of performance over time. You can access these results in the {{< var validmind.platform >}}, identify deviations, and take corrective actions as needed.

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-70-ns}
To start uploading ongoing monitoring results for a model to {{< var vm.product >}}, you enable monitoring in your code and then select a monitoring template. Our user guide can walk you through the process of setting up ongoing monitoring step-by-step.

PR #191: [SC-6060] Initial support for bias and fairness tests
URL: https://github.com/validmind/validmind-library/pull/191
Labels: enhancement
--->
#### Support for bias and fairness tests

The latest update to the {{< var validmind.developer >}} introduces new features and improvements that enhance bias and fairness testing.

To let you evaluate model bias and fairness effectively across protected classes, four new metrics are available: 

- [`ProtectedClassesCombination`](/validmind/validmind/tests/data_validation/ProtectedClassesCombination.qmd){target=_blank}
- [`ProtectedClassesDescription`](/validmind/validmind/tests/data_validation/ProtectedClassesDescription.qmd){target=_blank}
- [`ProtectedClassesDisparity`](/validmind/validmind/tests/data_validation/ProtectedClassesDisparity.qmd){target=_blank}
- [`ProtectedClassesThresholdOptimizer`](/validmind/validmind/tests/data_validation/ProtectedClassesThresholdOptimizer.qmd){target=_blank}

There is also an additional parameter `class_of_interest` in the SHAPGlobalImportance tool for better SHAP value selection.

A new Jupyter Notebook guides you through building a credit risk model with integrated bias and fairness analysis.

Accompanying this, a dataset called `lending_club_biased.csv.gz` and its processing script have been added for testing purposes, alongside an update to the dataset module initializer.

PR #155: Feat: Mechanism for Filtering Columns in a Dataset when Running a Test
URL: https://github.com/validmind/validmind-library/pull/155
Labels: enhancement
--->
#### Filtering columns when running tests

When running a test, you now have the option to filter specific columns in your dataset.

- This feature helps simplify and analyze your results more efficiently. 
- For example, you can use this enhancement to focus on relevant data. 

Tests can run on a subset of columns in a dataset without creating a new dataset with columns removed. 

The following example shows how to run the [`DatasetDescription`](/validmind/validmind/tests/data_validation/DatasetDescription.qmd){target=_blank} test with only a single column from a dataset:

```python
from validmind.tests import run_test

result = run_test(
    test_id="validmind.data_validation.DatasetDescription",
    inputs={
        "dataset": {
            "input_id": "my_dataset",
            "columns": ["col1"]
        }
    },
)
```

Notice how the `dataset` input is set to a dictionary whose key `input_id` maps to a particular input dataset. And whose `columns` key sets the subset of columns from the original dataset to pass to the `DatasetDescription` test.
