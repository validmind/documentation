### Support for ongoing monitoring

Monitoring is a critical component of model risk management, as emphasized in regulations such as SR 11-7, SS1/23, and E-24. With this release of ValidMind, we officially support ongoing monitoring. You can enable this feature for both existing and new models.

![Ongoing monitoring of a model](/releases/2024-oct-22/358433496-02a6d5b9-0521-4110-b45c-b91e06798a97.png){fig-alt="An image showing some ongoing monitoring data on the ValidMind platform" class="screenshot"}

Scenarios where ongoing monitoring is warranted:

- Pre-approval monitoring of new models
- Monitoring during significant updates
- Post-production monitoring

The monitoring template for your model automatically populates with data as your code runs, providing a comprehensive view of performance over time. You can access these results in the {{< var validmind.platform >}}, identify deviations, and take corrective actions as needed.

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-70-ns}
To start uploading ongoing monitoring results for a model to ValidMind, you enable monitoring in your code and then select a monitoring template. Our user guide can walk you through the process of setting up ongoing monitoring step-by-step.

### Archive and delete models

<!-- TODO screenshot -->

When you need to decommission models that you no longer need, you can now archive and then delete them. This feature helps keep your model inventory accurate and up to date with your organization's current resources.

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-70-ns}
You now have new stages for inventory models, including `ACTIVE`, `ARCHIVED`, and `DELETED`, which are shown as a new column in the model inventory and as field in the model overview.

- Archived models are read-only and do not contribute to statistics or reports. 
- Models must be inactive and archived before they can be deleted. 
- Model archiving and deletion are recorded in the activity feed. 
- An administrator can restore archived models if needed.

PR #191: [SC-6060] Initial support for bias and fairness tests
URL: https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/191
Labels: enhancement
--->
### Support for bias and fairness tests

The latest update to the {{< var validmind.developer >}} introduces new features and improvements that enhance bias and fairness testing.

To let you evaluate model bias and fairness effectively across protected classes, four new metrics are available: 

- [`ProtectedClassesCombination`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind/tests/data_validation/ProtectedClassesCombination.html){target=_blank}
- [`ProtectedClassesDescription`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind/tests/data_validation/ProtectedClassesDescription.html){target=_blank}
- [`ProtectedClassesDisparity`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind/tests/data_validation/ProtectedClassesDisparity.html){target=_blank}
- [`ProtectedClassesThresholdOptimizer`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind/tests/data_validation/ProtectedClassesThresholdOptimizer.html){target=_blank}

There is also an additional parameter `class_of_interest` in the SHAPGlobalImportance tool for better SHAP value selection.

A new Jupyter Notebook guides you through building a credit risk model with integrated bias and fairness analysis.

PR #155: Feat: Mechanism for Filtering Columns in a Dataset when Running a Test
URL: https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/155
Labels: enhancement
--->
### Filtering columns when running tests

When running a test, you now have the option to filter specific columns in your dataset.

- This feature helps simplify and analyze your results more efficiently. 
- For example, you can use this enhancement to focus on relevant data. 

Tests can run on a subset of columns in a dataset without creating a new dataset with columns removed. 

The following example shows how to run the [`DatasetDescription`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind/tests/data_validation/DatasetDescription.html){target=_blank} test with only a single column from a dataset:

```python
from validmind.tests import run_test

result = run_test(
    test_id="validmind.data_validation.DatasetDescription",
    inputs={
        "dataset": {
            "input_id": "my_dataset",
            "columns": ["col1"]
        }
    },
)
```

Notice how the `dataset` input is set to a dictionary whose key `input_id` maps to a particular input dataset. And whose `columns` key sets the subset of columns from the original dataset to pass to the `DatasetDescription` test.

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-60-ns}
A new Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to selectively include columns in your analysis based on your specific criteria.
