PR #552: Updated workflows/actions to dynamically generate an `.env` file

### Actions to dynamically generate an `.env` file

Valid Mind Academy

- The Valid Mind Academy Developer Fundamentals course has been updated with an improved version of the Valid Mind Introduction for Model Developers Jupyter Notebook.

- Now the embedded notebook executes live within the training. This allows you to interact with output cells previously omitted, such as when previewing the documentation template.

- The training notebook serves as a reference guide. It helps you know what to expect when you first run the cells.

Jupyter notebooks

- We've now included details on how to initialize ValidMind with credentials stored in an `.env` file in our Jupyter Notebook samples.

- Our documentation guides have also been updated to match this new experience.
 
Generated PR summary: 
 
This update enhances the environment configuration and execution of Jupyter Notebooks within the project. You can now use new environment variables (`VM_API_HOST`, `VM_API_KEY`, `VM_API_SECRET`, and `VM_API_MODEL`) as specified in the updated `.env.example` file. GitHub Actions for demo, production, and staging notebooks require an `env_file` input to ensure that a `.env` file is in place before notebook execution. Workflow files are also updated to dynamically create a `.env` file with secrets before executing notebooks.

A new `execute` target in the `Makefile` facilitates running Jupyter Notebooks with specific profiles and file paths, duplicating notebooks for execution rather than checking them out from the main branch.

Documentation updates include enhanced instructions on storing model credentials in `.env` files and using them in notebooks, as well as examples for enabling monitoring when using these configuration files. These changes aim to improve flexibility, security, and streamline your experience with executing and monitoring Jupyter Notebooks.

### Add developer fundamentals videos & training fixes

We created a series of 10 short videos

These videos help you learn about the model documentation process as a developer. You are introduced to generating model documentation that includes tests. You also learn about adding your own tests, editing the content online, and then submitting your documentation for approval so that a validator can review the submitted documentation.

Generated PR summary: 
 
This update to the ValidMind project includes several improvements and new features. The titles of training modules in the `internal/templates/videos/index.qmd` file have been revised, such as renaming "Documenting Models 101" to "Developer Fundamentals" and "Validating Models 101" to "Train a model". You can now find three new SVG assets in the `site/assets/img/` directory, with specific colors for different visual elements.

In the `site/guide/guides.qmd`, you will discover a new video series named 'Developer Fundamentals', comprising 10 videos, along with a refreshed card title for the 'Validating Models 101' series. References within the `site/notebooks/tutorials/intro_for_model_developers_EXECUTED.ipynb` file have been updated from "ValidMind Developer Framework" to "ValidMind Library", enhancing clarity across various sections including initialization and documentation processes.

The training module in `site/training/developer-fundamentals/developer-fundamentals.qmd` sees improved section references and added interactivity, aiming to streamline your learning experience. Lastly, the addition of a JSON file, `test-results/.last-run.json`, helps track test results, confirming that all tests have successfully passed.

### Add login button to docs site

We added the option to log in to the ValidMind platform

You can now visit our docs site and easily find the right login.

Click **Login** to try logging into the ValidMind platform.
 
Generated PR summary: 
 
The website's navigation menu now features a 'Login' section with multiple options. The search box has been removed from the sidebar, and a 'Login' menu has been added to the right side of the navigation bar. This menu includes links to different login portals (US1 and CA1) for the ValidMind platform. A help link titled "Which login should I use?" guides you through choosing the appropriate login option for ValidMind. There are also styling updates in `styles.css` that enhance the appearance of the new login menu, including changes to background color, border, text color, padding, and hover effects.
