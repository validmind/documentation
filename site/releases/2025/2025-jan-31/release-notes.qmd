## Release highlights — `25.01`

::: {.callout}
Our documentation now follows the new **unified versioning scheme** for our software, starting with this `25.01` release. Included in this release:

- **{{< var validmind.developer >}} — `v2.7.7`**
- **{{< var validmind.platform >}} — `v1.29.10`**

#### Why a unified versioning scheme?

We manage multiple repositories, each with its own version tags. The new versioning scheme replaces the {{< var validmind.developer >}} version in the documentation to clarify that each release includes code from multiple repositories rather than a single source.

This change simplifies tracking changes for each {{< var vm.product >}} release and streamlines version management for you. Release frequency and the upgrade process remain unchanged.

URL: https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/1117

### Custom reports and dashboards

You can now create personalized views to surface the insights you want right when you log in to the ValidMind platform. With customizable reporting, your teams can tailor the format, metrics, and level of detail to each audience while maintaining consistency in the underlying data. 

For instance, a chief risk officer might set up a custom _high-risk dashboard_ that combines widgets for:

- High-risk (Tier 1) models, their owners, and their status
- High-risk findings for different models and their status

![Custom dashboards allow you to create personalized views](custom-dashboards.png){width="809" fig-alt="A screenshot showing two custom dashboards with table views for high-risk models and findings" .screenshot}

You can add as many dashboards as you need to suit different use cases, whether it's managing model documentation and testing as a developer, tracking findings in validation reports as a developer, or monitoring analytics.

### Edit your dashboards

We’ve streamlined dashboard configuration with dedicated view and edit modes. Click **Edit Mode** to make changes, then click **Done Editing** to save and return to view mode: 

![Edit mode for your dashboard](401290459-838f933f-f15a-4503-bbe7-a6514f736773.png){width="809" fig-alt="A screenshot showing edit mode" .screenshot}

To prevent any confusion when multiple people are working on the same dashboard, we've added some helpful safeguards:

- If someone else makes changes while you're editing, you'll get a friendly notification to reload the page
- The system automatically detects if you're looking at an older version of the dashboard and prompts you to get the latest updates

#### Document credit risk scorecard models using XGBoost

We've introduced enhancements to the {{< var validmind.developer >}} that focus on documenting credit risk scorecard models:

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-50-ns .pr4}
- **New notebooks**: Two Jupyter Notebooks demonstrate how to document application scorecard models using the {{< var vm.developer >}}. 

    These notebooks provide a step-by-step guide for loading a demo dataset, preprocessing data, training models, and documenting the model.

- **New tests**:

  - [`MutualInformation`](/tests/data_validation/MutualInformation.md): Evaluates feature relevance by calculating mutual information scores between features and the target variable.  
  - [`ScoreBandDefaultRates`](/tests/data_validation/ScoreBandDefaultRates.md): Analyzes default rates and population distribution across credit score bands.  
  - [`CalibrationCurve`](/tests/model_validation/sklearn/CalibrationCurve.md): Assesses calibration by comparing predicted probabilities against observed frequencies.  
  - [`ClassifierThresholdOptimization`](/tests/model_validation/sklearn/ClassifierThresholdOptimization.md): Visualizes threshold optimization methods for binary classification models.  
  - [`ModelParameters`](/tests/model_validation/sklearn/ModelParameters.md): Extracts and displays model parameters for transparency and reproducibility.  
  - [`ScoreProbabilityAlignment`](/tests/model_validation/sklearn/ScoreProbabilityAlignment.md): Evaluates alignment between credit scores and predicted probabilities.

Modifications have also been made to existing tests to improve functionality and accuracy. The [`TooManyZeroValues`](/tests/data_validation/TooManyZeroValues.md) test now includes a row count and applies a percentage threshold for zero values.

The [`split`](/validmind/validmind/datasets/regression/lending_club.html#preprocess){target="_blank"} function in `lending_club.py` has been enhanced to support an optional validation set, allowing for more flexible dataset splitting.

A new utility function, [`get_demo_test_config`](/validmind/validmind/datasets/credit_risk/lending_club.html#get_demo_test_config){target="_blank"}, has been added to generate a default test configuration for demo purposes.

URL: https://github.com/validmind/validmind-library/pull/293
Labels: enhancement
--->
### Threshold lines in unit metric plots

When logging metrics using `log_metric()`, you can now include a `thresholds` dictionary. For example, use `thresholds={"target": 0.8, "minimum": 0.6}` to define multiple reference levels.

![Threshold lines in unit metric plots](403022728-81371dda-3e2c-4b53-abbe-a0caa7c0501a.png){width="949" fig-alt="A screenshot showing threshold lines in unit metric plots" .screenshot}

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-70-ns .pr4}
These thresholds automatically appear as horizontal reference lines when you add a *Metric Over Time* block to the documentation. The visualization uses a distinct color palette to differentiate between thresholds. It displays only the most recent threshold configuration and includes threshold information in both the chart legend and data table.
:::

::: {.w-30-ns .tr}
[Add metrics over time](/guide/monitoring/work-with-metrics-over-time.qmd){.button}

::::
This enhancement provides immediate visual context for metric values. It helps track metric performance against multiple defined thresholds over time.

Usage example:

```
log_metric(
    key="AUC Score",
    value=auc,
    recorded_at=datetime(2024, 1, 1),
    thresholds={
        "high_risk": 0.6,
        "medium_risk": 0.7,
        "low_risk": 0.8,
    }

### Simplified workflow nodes

Workflows are now easier to read when zoomed out, helped by a larger modal window and simplified nodes:

Hovering over a node highlights all `in` and `out` connections, making relationships clearer:
