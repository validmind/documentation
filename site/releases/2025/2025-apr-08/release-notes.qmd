URL: https://github.com/validmind/validmind-library/pull/285
Labels: enhancement
--->
##### Add raw data to `validmind` library tests

Adding raw data storage

Raw data storage is added across all of our test library. Every ValidMind test now returns a `RawData` object. You can use the `RawData` object in post-processing functions to recreate any test output. The feature continues the trend towards more flexibility and customizability.
 
Generated PR summary: 
 
This release introduces significant updates to the AI test scripts and unit tests by integrating a new `RawData` mechanism. This allows you to store and retrieve intermediate data used in test functions, enhancing post-processing capabilities and providing more detailed insights into test results.

The script `add_test_description.py` has been removed, suggesting a change in how test descriptions are managed or generated. In its place, a new script called `bulk_ai_test_updates.py` is added to facilitate bulk updates on test files using AI, supporting actions like adding descriptions and raw data.

Many test scripts now utilize the `RawData` class to capture intermediate data useful for regenerating test results during post-processing. Test scripts have been updated to return this raw data alongside traditional outputs like figures and tables.

Unit tests are also updated to accommodate these changes, particularly by checking for the presence of `RawData` in test results and verifying its contents. New unit tests ensure the correct functionality of the `RawData` integration.

Codebase refactoring improves readability and maintainability through reorganization of imports, removal of redundant code, and adherence to coding standards. Security and dependency management are enhanced by ensuring all necessary dependencies are correctly imported and utilized, reducing runtime errors and improving overall security.

##### Add initial support for post-processing functions

Adding support for post-processing functions

You can modify test outputs without changing the test code.
 
Generated PR summary: 
 
This update to the ValidMind project focuses on enhancing post-processing capabilities and raw data handling. You can now utilize a `post_process_fn` parameter in the `run_test` function, allowing the customization of test outputs through user-defined post-processing functions. This enables modifications to the `TestResult` object after running a test, such as altering tables and creating figures.

The update introduces a `RawData` class that encapsulates raw data generated during test execution. This class allows for easier inspection and serialization of additional data not directly shown in test results. A new Jupyter notebook, `post_processing_functions.ipynb`, is available to demonstrate how to use these post-processing functions with practical examples like modifying tables and creating figures.

The Python version has been updated in the GitHub Actions workflow from 3.8 to 3.11, ensuring compatibility with newer Python features. The enhancement also extends to the `ROCCurve` test, which now returns both a `RawData` object and a Plotly figure for flexible data visualization.

Lastly, various code refinements include improvements for JSON serialization of numpy arrays using a `HumanReadableEncoder`, along with refactored logic for handling multiple figure types. These changes are designed to improve customization and detail in handling test results within the ValidMind library.

PR #274: [SC-7759] Exposing static descriptions in test results
URL: https://github.com/validmind/validmind-library/pull/274
Labels: enhancement
--->
#### Exposing static descriptions in test results

Added `doc` property to `TestResult` class

The `doc` property clearly separates the static test documentation from the LLM-generated descriptions. This change helps distinguish between the original test documentation (accessed via `result.doc`) and the dynamic descriptions generated by the LLM. You can access these via `result.description`.

The `doc` property contains the test's docstring. It provides direct access to users which clarifies the test's purpose and behavior.
 
Generated PR summary: 
 
This update to the ValidMind project includes various enhancements and bug fixes. You can now document test results more comprehensively with the addition of a `doc` attribute to the `TestResult` class, which stores related documentation. Functions such as `build_test_result`, `_run_composite_test`, `_run_comparison_test`, and `run_test` are updated to incorporate this documentation into the test result pipeline. The ROC curve tests in `test_ROCCurve.py`, including `test_roc_curve_structure` and `test_perfect_separation`, are enhanced to accommodate changes in the `ROCCurve` function's return values, which now include a tuple of `RawData` and `Figure`. The improvements add assertions to verify that the `RawData` object has expected fields like `fpr`, `tpr`, and `auc`. Additionally, modifications to the test execution process ensure that if any unit tests fail in `tests/test_unit_tests.py`, it exits with a failure status, enhancing overall testing robustness.

#### Explore dynamic llm context injection in test descriptions

Added the capability to include contextual information in LLM-based descriptions  
The changes mainly focus on improving the generation of descriptions for test results. You can do this by incorporating additional context that you specify through environment variables.
 
Generated PR summary: 
 
This update enhances the ValidMind library by enabling you to include contextual information in LLM-based descriptions. The improvements focus on generating more informative test result descriptions through additional context specified via environment variables.

Notable changes include the addition of a Jupyter notebook, `llm_descriptions_context.ipynb`, which demonstrates how to incorporate context into LLM-based descriptions. You can see examples of setting up environments, initializing datasets and models, and comparing test results with and without added context.

A new function, `_get_llm_global_context()`, is introduced in `test_descriptions.py` for retrieving context from environment variables, ensuring that context is utilized only if enabled and non-empty. The `generate_description` function now incorporates this context when creating description input data.

Additionally, the `user.jinja` template has been updated to conditionally add the context in generated descriptions if available. This allows you to align LLM-generated insights more closely with specific business requirements or policies by providing extra information about tests or use cases.

**Changes**

- Added threshold support in `log_metric()`.
- Added notebook `how_to\log_metrics_over_time.ipynb`.

**Testing**

- Tested with various threshold configurations.
- Verified threshold line rendering in the UI.
- Validated that threshold updates reflect immediately in visualization.

**Example**

```
log_metric(
    key="AUC Score",
    value=auc,
    recorded_at=datetime(2024, 1, 1),
    thresholds={
        "high_risk": 0.6,
        "medium_risk": 0.7,
        "low_risk": 0.8,
    }
)

#### Support config option for logging test results

We now have configuration options 

You can pass configuration options through `result.log()` to display and customize the test results block in UI documents.

Available config options:

- hideTitle
- hideText
- hideParams
- hideTables
- hideFigures

```python
test = vm.tests.run_test(
    "validmind.data_validation.TabularDescriptionTables:raw_dataset",
    input_grid={
        "dataset": [vm_raw_dataset],
    },
)
test.log(
    config={
        "hideFigures": False,
        "hideTables": True
    }
)
```
 
Generated PR summary: 
 
This release includes several enhancements and bug fixes to the `validmind` API client and result logging functionalities. You can now specify configuration options when displaying test results through a `config` parameter added to the `alog_test_result` and `log_async` methods. These options allow you to hide titles, text, parameters, tables, and figures in the document view as desired. A new method, `validate_log_config`, verifies that provided configuration options are valid by checking for invalid keys and ensuring all values are boolean. If any issues are found, an `InvalidParameterError` is raised.

The error handling is improved with the introduction of the new `InvalidParameterError` class to manage cases involving invalid parameters. Code refactoring efforts include updating the `log_metric` function to return results consistently from `run_async`, aiding in potential error handling. Additionally, docstrings across the codebase received updates for improved clarity.

Test updates accompany these changes as well, specifically altering the `test_log_test_result` case to incorporate the new configuration parameter and ensure thorough testing of logging functionality with these improvements. These enhancements offer greater flexibility in how test results are logged and displayed while strengthening error management and overall code clarity.

#### Update stakeholder role mapping in workflows builder and filtering logic

Replace this comment with your description
 
Generated PR summary: 
 
This update centralizes and standardizes field identifier handling by introducing a shared constant (FIELD_IDENTIFIERS) throughout the application. In the JsonLogicHumanizer component, role mappings are refined to filter roles based on their scope; roles not of 'Model' scope are mapped to the USER_ROLES identifier, while 'Model' scoped roles are treated as model stakeholder roles using USER_MODEL_STAKEHOLDERS. Merged field mappers now combine custom, general role, and stakeholder mappers for consistent processing of JSON logic queries.

The ApprovalPanel component's query builder is enhanced to use FIELD_IDENTIFIERS instead of hardcoded strings for improved consistency and maintainability. It also introduces new configurations for model stakeholder roles, allowing these roles to be properly selectable and mapped in the UI.

The ApprovalNode component updates conditions to check against FIELD_IDENTIFIERS, which clarifies references to user roles, stakeholder roles, and custom fields. The humanizeJsonLogic utility's outputs now consistently align with updated constants based on role assignments.

Finally, in the useQueryBuilder hook, FIELD_IDENTIFIERS are exported for consistent usage across components, with query fields adjusted to reflect new role identifier mappings. These changes enhance code maintainability by reducing hardcoded values and ensuring consistency in role-based operations across the system.
