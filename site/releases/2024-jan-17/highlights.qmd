## Enhancements



<!---Upgrade kbar by @cachafla in [#511](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/511)--->
- **Upgraded search experience**: We've updated the component in our web application responsible for the search command bar interface. The new version brings enhanced search performance, particularly for multi-word queries.

## Bug fixes

<!---Cachafla/sc 2655/fix displaying dynamic index in template by @cachafla in [#514](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/514)--->
- **Dynamic index display in templates**. We fixed an issue where the internal `order` and `index` properties were incorrectly exposed in the template editor. These properties have no effect during template editing as they are dynamically generated. The fix now prevents these properties from being saved back to the template.

<!---Allow clicking on activities related to dynamic text blocks by @cachafla in [#501](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/501)--->
- **Activity links now redirect users to the relevant section**. We fixed an issue where clicking on recent activity items related to comments or test descriptions inside a test- driven block would take the user to a non-existent page. This functionality has been corrected by redirecting the user to the section that a content block belongs to.

<!---Cachafla/sc 2635/issues with search functionality by @cachafla in [#507](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/507)--->
- **Search experience fixes**. We implemented multiple fixes to the search functionality in the Platform UI:
  
  - Linking from recent activity items has been corrected to ensure accurate navigation.
  - Routing to documentation pages when a search result is associated with text in a test-driven block now works as expected.
  - Search now excludes results for `content_id` that are no longer part of the documentation.
  - Search functionality is now available from project overview pages. Previously, search only worked when invoked from documentation pages.

<!---Fix issues with user picker by @cachafla in [#523](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/523)--->
- **Issues with the user picker component**. We fixed the following UI/UX issues with the user picker interface component:
  
  - Clicking on **X** now properly clears the current search input and dismisses the user list.
  - Clicking on **Cancel** now properly clears out any unsaved users from the list.
  - Entering text now correctly filters users that match the search criteria.
  - A new 'micro search' utility improves user matching.
  
  Additionally, we updated the business unit selector component to be a simple dropdown.

<!---Cachafla/sc 2646/status updates on dashboard disappearing by @cachafla in [#513](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/513)--->
- **Disappearing status updates on dashboard**. We fixed an issue where the **Recent activity** widget would become unavailable when clicking on **Status updates**. We now show an empty state element when there is no data to show.
