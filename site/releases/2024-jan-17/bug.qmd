<!---Allow clicking on activities related to dynamic text blocks by @cachafla in [#501](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/501)--->
- **Allow clicking on activities related to dynamic text blocks**. - Fixed an issue where clicking on recent activity items related to comments or test descriptions inside a test driven block would take the user to a non-existent page


<!---Cachafla/sc 2635/issues with search functionality by @cachafla in [#507](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/507)--->
- **Cachafla/sc 2635/issues with search functionality**. Multiple fixes to search functionality:

- Ensure we correctly link from recent activity items
- Properly route to documentation pages when a search result belongs to a test driven block's text
- Ensure we filter out search results for `content_id` that are no longer part of the documentation
- Ensure search works from the project overview page. It was only working if one invoked it from a documentation page


<!---Fix issues with user picker by @cachafla in [#523](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/523)--->
- **Fix issues with user picker**. - Fixes the following UI/UX issues with the user picker component:
    - Clicking on X properly clears the current search input and dismisses the user list
    - Clicking on Cancel properly clears out any unsaved users from the list
    - Typing now properly filters users that match the search criteria
    - Implemented a simple "micro search" utility to improve matching
- Update "business unit" selector component to a simple dropdown


<!---Cachafla/sc 2646/status updates on dashboard disappearing by @cachafla in [#513](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/513)--->
- **Cachafla/sc 2646/status updates on dashboard disappearing**. - Fixed issue where the `Recent activity` widget would "disappear" when clicking on "Status updates". We now show an empty state element when there's no data to show
