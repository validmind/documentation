<!---[SC-2303] Shap metric issue resolved by @juanmleng in [#262](https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/262)--->
- **Shap metric issue resolved**. - We set `matplotlib` to version `3.7.x` in `pyproject.toml` to fix an incompatibility with the latest `matplotlib` version (`3.8.0`). This incompatibility was causing SHAP plot errors. We will keep track of `matplotlib` releases for future updates. Once fixed, we will consider updating the version.
