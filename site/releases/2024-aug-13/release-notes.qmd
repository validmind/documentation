### Customize your dashboard

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-70-ns}
We enhanced the {{< var validmind.platform >}} **{{< fa home >}} Dashboard** with new customization options: 

- Rearrange and resize widgets to suit your preferences. 

- Add charts from **{{< fa square-poll-vertical >}} Analytics** to your **{{< fa home >}} Dashboard**, for a more personalized and streamlined experience.

### Generalized support for comparison tests

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-70-ns}

To make comparison tests easier to analyze, we've added support to specify an input grid when a test has many `datasets` or `models`. 

:::

::: {.w-30-ns}

::: {.tc}
[Run comparison tests](/notebooks/how_to/run_tests/2_run_comparison_tests.ipynb){.button}
:::

:::

::::

::: {.callout}
You'll need to pass a list of lists for `datasets` or `models`, since the original input is a list of inputs.
:::

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-50-ns}

For example, the following test produces a combined GINI table:

- XGBoost on training and test dataset
- RandomForest on training and test dataset

```py
vm.tests.run_test(
    "validmind.model_validation.statsmodels.GINITable",

    input_grid={
        "datasets": [
            [vm_train_ds, vm_test_ds],
        ],
        "model": [vm_model_xgb, vm_model_rf],
    },
)
```

:::

::: {.w-40-ns}

This test produces a combined PSI report for XGBoost and RandomForest on training and test datasets:

```py
vm.tests.run_test(
    "validmind.model_validation.sklearn.PopulationStabilityIndex",

    input_grid={
        "datasets": [
            [vm_train_ds, vm_test_ds],
        ],
        "model": [vm_model_xgb, vm_model_rf],
    },
)
```

## Bug fixes

<!---
PR #140: [SC-5466] Exclude categorical and binary features from outlier tests
URL: https://github.com/validmind/validmind-library/pull/140
Labels: bug
--->
### Exclude categorical & binary features from outlier tests

We've excluded categorical and binary features from the outlier tests [`IQROutliersTable`](/tests/data_validation/IQROutliersTable.md) and [`IQROutliersBarPlot`](/tests/data_validation/IQROutliersBarPlot.md).

This fix ensures that outlier detection is applied correctly and appropriately, improving computational efficiency and leading to more relevant, accurate, and meaningful insights from the data.

## Documentation

### Support for GCP Private Service Connect 

We've introduced support for Google Cloud Private Service Connect for enhanced network security and privacy. This is in addition to the existing support for AWS PrivateLink.

- Google Cloud Private Service Connect allows private connections between {{< var vm.product >}} and your company network. It ensures secure communication over the Google network without exposing traffic to the public internet. 
- By using private endpoints within your `VPC`, you can reduce your network's attack surface and maintain traffic privacy.
