### Customize your dashboard

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-50-ns}

We enhanced the {{< var validmind.platform >}} **{{< fa home >}} Dashboard** with new customization options: 

- Rearrange and resize widgets to suit your preferences. 
- Add charts from [**Reports**](/guide/model-validation/view-reports.qmd) to your Dashboard, for a more personalized and streamlined experience.

PR #144: Generalize support for comparison tests
URL: https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/144
Labels: enhancement

### Generalize support for comparison tests

To make [comparison tests](/notebooks/how_to/run_tests/2_run_comparison_tests.ipynb) easier to analyze, we've added support to specify an input grid when a test has many `datasets` or `models`.

::: {.callout}
You'll need to pass a list of lists for `datasets` or `models`, since the original input is a list of inputs.
::: 


:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-50-ns}

For example, the following test produces a combined GINI table:

- XGBoost on training and test dataset
- RandomForest on training and test dataset

```py
vm.tests.run_test(
    "validmind.model_validation.statsmodels.GINITable",

    input_grid={
        "datasets": [
            [vm_train_ds, vm_test_ds],
        ],
        "model": [vm_model_xgb, vm_model_rf],
    },
)
```

:::

::: {.w-40-ns}

This test produces a combined PSI report for XGBoost and RandomForest on training and test datasets:

```py
vm.tests.run_test(
    "validmind.model_validation.sklearn.PopulationStabilityIndex",

    input_grid={
        "datasets": [
            [vm_train_ds, vm_test_ds],
        ],
        "model": [vm_model_xgb, vm_model_rf],
    },
)
```

## Bug fixes

<!---
PR #140: [SC-5466] Exclude categorical and binary features from outlier tests
URL: https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/140
Labels: bug
--->
### Exclude categorical & binary features from outlier tests

We've excluded categorical and binary features from the outlier tests [`IQROutliersTable`](/tests/data_validation/IQROutliersTable.md) and [`IQROutliersBarPlot`](/tests/data_validation/IQROutliersBarPlot.md).

This fix ensures that outlier detection is applied correctly and appropriately, improving computational efficiency and leading to more relevant, accurate, and meaningful insights from the data.

## Documentation

### Support for GCP Private Service Connect 

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-75-ns}

We've introduced support for Google Cloud Private Service Connect for enhanced network security and privacy. This is in addition to the existing support for AWS PrivateLink.

- Google Cloud Private Service Connect allows private connections between ValidMind and your company network. It ensures secure communication over the Google network without exposing traffic to the public internet. 
- By using private endpoints within your `VPC`, you can reduce your network's attack surface and maintain traffic privacy.
