### Ability to customize dashboard using widgets

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-60-ns}
We enhanced the dashboard with new customization options. Users can now resize and rearrange dashboard widgets to better suit their preferences. Additionally, you can easily add charts from the Reports section to your dashboard and remove them as needed, providing a more personalized and flexible user experience.

PR #144: Generalize support for comparison tests

## Enhancements

### Generalize support for comparison tests

To make comparison tests easier to analyze, we've added support to specify an input grid when a test has many `datasets` or `models`.

::: {.callout-important}
For this to work, you need to pass a list of lists for `datasets` or `models`, since the original input is a list of inputs.
::: 

For example, the following test produces a combined GINI table:

- XGBoost on training and test dataset
- RandomForest on training and test dataset

```py
vm.tests.run_test(
    "validmind.model_validation.statsmodels.GINITable",

    input_grid={
        "datasets": [
            [vm_train_ds, vm_test_ds],
        ],
        "model": [vm_model_xgb, vm_model_rf],
    },
)
```

This test produces a combined PSI report for XGBoost and RandomForest on training and test datasets.

```py
vm.tests.run_test(
    "validmind.model_validation.sklearn.PopulationStabilityIndex",

    input_grid={
        "datasets": [
            [vm_train_ds, vm_test_ds],
        ],
        "model": [vm_model_xgb, vm_model_rf],
    },
)
```

PR #874: Rod/sc 5517/ability to configure model dependencies
URL: https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/874
Labels: enhancement
--->
### Ability to configure model dependencies

Model dependencies can now be configured on the inventory model overview page.

- Edit upstream model dependencies
- Edit downstream model dependencies
- If you add model A as an upstream dependency to model B, then model B becomes a downstream dependency to model A.

## Documentation

### Add private service connect and rework login info

We've introduced support for Google Cloud Private Service Connect for enhanced network security and privacy. This is in addition to the existing support for AWS PrivateLink.

Google Cloud Private Service Connect allows private connections between ValidMind and your company network. It ensures secure communication over the Google network without exposing traffic to the public internet. 

By using private endpoints within your `VPC`, you can reduce your network's attack surface and maintain traffic privacy.
