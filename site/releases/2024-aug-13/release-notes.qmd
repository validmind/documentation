### Customize your dashboard using widgets

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

PR #144: Generalize support for comparison tests
URL: https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/144
Labels: enhancement

### Generalize support for comparison tests

To make comparison tests easier to analyze, we've added support to specify an input grid when a test has many `datasets` or `models`.

::: {.callout-important}
You'll need to pass a list of lists for `datasets` or `models`, since the original input is a list of inputs.
::: 

For example, the following test produces a combined GINI table:

- XGBoost on training and test dataset
- RandomForest on training and test dataset

```py
vm.tests.run_test(
    "validmind.model_validation.statsmodels.GINITable",

    input_grid={
        "datasets": [
            [vm_train_ds, vm_test_ds],
        ],
        "model": [vm_model_xgb, vm_model_rf],
    },
)
```

This test produces a combined PSI report for XGBoost and RandomForest on training and test datasets:

```py
vm.tests.run_test(
    "validmind.model_validation.sklearn.PopulationStabilityIndex",

    input_grid={
        "datasets": [
            [vm_train_ds, vm_test_ds],
        ],
        "model": [vm_model_xgb, vm_model_rf],
    },
)
```

### Reports page improvements

We added new widgets to the Reports tab, including:

- Total models
- Total findings
- Open findings
- Past due findings
- Closed findings

This summarizes key information from your reports, available at a glance.

## Documentation

### Add private service connect and rework login info

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-75-ns}
We've introduced support for Google Cloud Private Service Connect for enhanced network security and privacy. This is in addition to the existing support for AWS PrivateLink.

Google Cloud Private Service Connect allows private connections between ValidMind and your company network. It ensures secure communication over the Google network without exposing traffic to the public internet. 

By using private endpoints within your `VPC`, you can reduce your network's attack surface and maintain traffic privacy.
