PR #29: Custom Metric Function Decorator
URL: https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/29
Labels: enhancement, highlight
--->
### custom metric function decorator

we've introduced a new `metric` decorator designed to turn any function into a ValidMind Metric. Custom metrics offer added flexibility by allowing you to extend the library of default metrics provided by ValidMind. This enables you to document any type of model or use case.

The new decorator simplifies the process of creating and using custom metrics by almost completely eliminating the boilerplate code required to define and register a custom metric. 

check out the [new notebook](https://docs.validmind.ai/notebooks/code_samples/custom_tests/implement_custom_tests.html) to see how you can start using custom metrics in your documentation

PR #67: Support for external models
URL: https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/67
Labels: enhancement, highlight
--->
### support for external models

you can now run documentation tests without passing a Python-native model object. This enables documenting:

models developed in non-python environments

non-standard model interfaces:

- models deployed as APIs, e.g., SageMaker model endpoints
- tools such as Spark where a "model" is not a typical object that exposes a `predict()` interface

run tests for these models

To run tests for these models, you typically need to load model predictions from a file, dataset, etc. The new `init_model` interface does not enforce a Python model object anymore. You only need to pass `attributes` that describe the model. This is required as a best practice for model documentation.

initializing an external model

Since there is no native Python object to pass to `init_model`, you need to pass attributes that describe the model:

```python
# Assume you want to load predictions for a PySpark ML model
model_attributes = {
    "architecture": "Spark",
    "language": "PySpark",
}

# Or maybe you're loading predictions for a SageMaker endpoint (model API)
model_attributes = {
    "architecture": "SageMaker Model",
    "language": "Python",
}
```

Call `init_model` without passing a model

Pass `attributes` instead:
```python
vm_model = vm.init_model(
    attributes=model_attributes,
    input_id="model"
)
```

assigning predictions

Since there's no model object available, the developer framework won't be able to call `model.predict()` and `model.predict_proba()`. You will need to load predictions and probabilities manually:
```python
vm_train_ds.assign_predictions(
    model=vm_model,
    prediction_values=prediction_values,
    prediction_probabilities=prediction_probabilities,
)
```
run tests as usual

You can run tests as usual. No other changes are needed.

### new introductory notebook for model developers

new introductory notebook for model developers

This notebook gives you a full introduction to the developer framework and teaches you how to document a model end-to-end.

high level sections:

**1. initialize the `ValidMind` developer framework**

The `ValidMind` Developer Framework provides a rich collection of documentation tools and test suites. These range from documenting descriptions of datasets to validating and testing models using various open-source testing frameworks.

**2. start the model development process with raw data, run out-of-the-box tests and add evidence to model documentation**

At this stage, the notebook provides details on how to access `ValidMind`'s test repository of individual tests. You will use these as building blocks to ensure a model is being built appropriately. The goal is to show how to run tests, investigate results, and add test results/evidence to the documentation.

For a full list of out-of-box tests, please refer to: https://docs.validmind.com/guide/test-descriptions.html

**3. learn how to implement custom tests**

Usually, you have many custom tests that are important to include in the model documentation. This section shows how to include custom tests and then how they can be added as additional evidence in the documentation.

**4. ensure completion of documentation**

In this stage, the notebook demonstrates how to ensure that model documentation includes custom tests. You will also learn how to make test configuration changes applicable to all tests in the model documentation template. By the end of this section, you should have a fully documented model ready for review.

PR #27: Support adding new extra columns on the fly
URL: https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/27
Labels: enhancement
--->
### support adding new extra columns on the fly

added support for two new VM dataset methods: `add_extra_column()` and `get_extra_column()`

### add_extra_column()

You can now register arbitrary extra columns in a dataset when a test needs to compute metrics outside of the existing (`features`, `targets`, `predictions`) sets of columns. 

An example is when credit risk-related metrics require access to a list of scores computed from predictions. In this case, there needs to be an extra column called `scores` that you use for computing the metrics.

Example usage:

```
python

# Init your dataset as usual
vm_train_ds = vm.init_dataset(
    dataset=train_df,
    input_id="train_dataset",
    target_column=customer_churn.target_column,
)

# Generate scores using a user-defined function:
scores = compute_my_scores(x_train)

# Assign a new "scores" column to vm_train_ds:
vm_train_ds.add_extra_column("scores", scores)
```

This function throws an error if no column values are passed:

```
python

vm_train_ds.add_extra_column("scores")

ValueError: Column values must be provided when the column doesn't exist in the dataset
```

You can also use `init_dataset` with a dataset that has precomputed scores, like this:

```
>
train_df.columns
Index(['CreditScore', 'Gender', 'Age', 'Tenure', 'Balance', 'NumOfProducts',
      'HasCrCard', 'IsActiveMember', 'EstimatedSalary', 'Exited',
      'Geography_France', 'Geography_Germany', 'Geography_Spain'], dtype='object')

> train_df["my_scores"] = scores
> train_df.columns
Index(['CreditScore', 'Gender', 'Age', 'Tenure', 'Balance', 'NumOfProducts',
      'HasCrCard', 'IsActiveMember','EstimatedSalary','Exited','Geography_France',
      'Geography_Germany','Geography_Spain','my_scores'],dtype='object')
```

Make sure you set the `feature_columns` properly:

```
python

vm_train_ds = vm.init_dataset(
    dataset=train_df,
    input_id="another_ds",
    feature_columns=[
        "CreditScore", "Gender", "Age", "Tenure","Balance","NumOfProducts",
        "HasCrCard", "IsActiveMember", "EstimatedSalary", 
        "Exited","Geography_France","Geography_Germany","Geography_Spain"
    ],
    target_column=customer_churn.target_column,
)

Then, call `add_extra_column()` to register the extra column:

```
>
another_ds.add_extra_column(column_name="my_scores")

Column my_scores exists in the dataset, registering as an extra column
```


### get_extra_column()

You can use this inside a test to retrieve the extra column values. Example:

```
python

scores = self.inputs.dataset.get_extra_column("scores")
```

### metric decorators should work with test providers

adding support for functional metrics for internal tests and test providers

Continuing our efforts to simplify the process for getting your custom code working in ValidMind, we now support `functional_metrics`, i.e., tests that can be defined as pure functions without any boilerplate.

See how this works and more in our [updated tutorial on custom test providers](https://docs.validmind.ai/notebooks/code_samples/custom_tests/external_test_providers.html).

this PR adds support for assigning `prediction_probabilities` to `assign_predictions`.

this allows:

- assign prediction values and probabilities that have been computed outside ValidMind (VM).
- incorporate prediction values and probabilities from datasets that already have prediction columns.
- automate the assignment of prediction values and probabilities within VM.

URL: https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/76
Labels: enhancement
--->
### define and implement required text data validation tests

To ensure the integrity of your data, you need to define and implement text data validation tests. Start by identifying the criteria your data must meet. These could include length, format, or specific content requirements.

Once you know what to validate, create tests for each criterion. For example, check if the text meets a minimum or maximum length. Verify that it follows a specific format like an email address or phone number.

Use coding techniques to implement these tests in your system. Functions in languages like Python can help automate the process. Testing regularly ensures your data remains accurate and reliable

the following tests for text data validation have been added:

* `validmind.data_validation.nlp.LanguageDetection`
* `validmind.data_validation.nlp.Toxicity`
* `validmind.data_validation.nlp.PolarityAndSubjectivity`
* `validmind.data_validation.nlp.Sentiment`

### validation report overview

- created a new validation report overview page

- this page shows a section-by-section outline of the model's validation report. It includes a total compliance summary for all risk areas associated with the model.

- you may hover over any section in the report outline to view the current compliance status in the document section.

- the new validation report page also adds an `Add_Finding` button

### sandbox instructions

The sandbox is a testing environment that lets you try out features without affecting the live system. Follow these steps to use the sandbox effectively:

set up your account
To begin, set up your sandbox account. Visit the registration page and provide the necessary details. Verify your email address through the confirmation link sent to you.

accessing the sandbox environment
After setting up your account, log in to access the sandbox. Navigate to [Sandbox Environment](https://sandbox.example.com) and enter your credentials.

testing features
Use the sandbox to test new features or changes. Make sure that all functionalities work as expected before applying them to the live system. Use sample data where possible.

reporting issues
If you encounter any problems while using the sandbox, report them immediately. Contact support through [Support Page](https://support.example.com) with detailed information about the issue.

resetting your environment
You can reset your sandbox environment at any time if needed. This reverts all changes and restores default settings. Go to "Settings" and select "Reset Environment."

understanding limitations
Keep in mind that some features might not be available in the sandbox. Check for any limitations mentioned on our [Documentation Page](https://docs.example.com).

following best practices
Always follow best practices while using the sandbox:
- Test extensively before making changes live.
- Use descriptive names for test cases.
- Document any deviations from expected behavior.

end of instructions

we added getting started information for the new valid mind sandbox environment

You use the sandbox to gain hands-on experience and explore what valid mind offers.

The sandbox mimics a production environment. It includes comprehensive resources such as notebooks with sample code you can run, sample models registered in the model inventory, and draft documentation and validation reports.

Most of our model documentation features are available for you to test in the sandbox. These include automated model testing and documentation, preparing model validation reports, and large language model (`LLM`) support.

These features provide a rich context for testing and evaluation using realistic models and datasets without any risk to your production environment.
