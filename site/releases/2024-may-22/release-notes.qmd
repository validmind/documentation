High level sections include:

1. **Initializing the {{< var validmind.developer >}}** — The {{< var vm.developer >}} provides tools for documentation and testing, from dataset descriptions to model validation using various open-source frameworks.
2. **Starting the model development process** — Access the test repository[^1] to use individual tests as building blocks for model development. Learn to run tests, analyze results, and add evidence to model documentation. 
3. **Implementing custom tests** — Include custom tests in model documentation. Learn how to add these tests and use them as additional evidence.
4. **Finalizing testing and documentation** — Ensure model documentation includes custom tests and configure settings for all tests in the template. By the end, you should have a fully documented model ready for review.

PR #67: Support for external models
URL: https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/67
Labels: enhancement, highlight
--->
### Support for external models

You can now run documentation tests without passing a Python-native model object. 

**This change enables you to document:**

- Models that are developed in non-Python environments
- Non-standard model interfaces:
  - Models deployed as APIs, such as SageMaker model endpoints
  - Tools such as Spark where a model is not a typical object that exposes a `predict()` interface

::: {.column-margin}
[Developer reference](/validmind/validmind.html){.button target="_blank"}

:::

To run tests for these models, you typically must load model predictions from a file, dataset, and so on. 

- The new `init_model` interface does not enforce a Python model object anymore. 
- You only need to pass `attributes` that describe the model which is required as a best practice for model documentation.

#### Initializing an external model

Since there is no native Python object to pass to `init_model`, you instead pass attributes that describe the model:

```python
# Assume you want to load predictions for a PySpark ML model

model_attributes = {
    "architecture": "Spark",
    "language": "PySpark",
}

# Or maybe you're loading predictions for a SageMaker endpoint (model API)
model_attributes = {
    "architecture": "SageMaker Model",
    "language": "Python",
}

# Call `init_model` without passing a model. Pass `attributes` instead.
vm_model = vm.init_model(
    attributes=model_attributes,
    input_id="model",
)
```

#### Assigning predictions

Since there's no model object available, the {{< var vm.developer >}} won't be able to call `model.predict()` or `model.predict_proba()`; you need to load predictions and probabilities manually. 

**For example:**

```python
vm_train_ds.assign_predictions(
    model=vm_model,
    prediction_values=prediction_values,
    prediction_probabilities=prediction_probabilities,
)
```

You can proceed to run tests on your data as you would under normal conditions, without needing to modify any other parts of your code.

### Custom test function decorators

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

- Custom tests offer added flexibility. They allow you to extend the library of default tests provided by {{< var vm.product >}} which enables you to document any type of model or use case.
- This new decorator simplifies creating and using custom tests by almost completely eliminating the boilerplate code required to define and register a custom test.

PR #27: Support adding new extra columns on the fly
URL: https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/27
Labels: enhancement
--->
### Add extra columns on the fly

We added support for two new VMDataset methods:

- `add_extra_column()`
- `get_extra_column()`

#### `add_extra_column()`

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-70-ns}
You can now register arbitrary extra columns in a dataset when a test needs to compute metrics outside of the existing sets of columns (features, targets, predictions). 

:::

::: {.w-30-ns .tc}

[add_extra_column()](/validmind/validmind/vm_models.html#VMDataset.add_extra_column){.button target="_blank"}

:::

::::

- For example, credit risk-related metrics may require access to a list of scores computed from predictions. 
- In this case, an extra column called `scores` is needed for computing the metrics.

**Example usage:**

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-50-ns}
```python
# Init your dataset as usual
vm_train_ds = vm.init_dataset(
    dataset=train_df,
    input_id="train_dataset",
    target_column=customer_churn.target_column,
)

# Generate scores using a user defined function:
scores = compute_my_scores(x_train)

# Assign a new "scores" column to vm_train_ds:
vm_train_ds.add_extra_column("scores", scores)
```

:::

::: {.w-40-ns}
This function returns an error if no column values are passed:

```python
vm_train_ds.add_extra_column("scores")

ValueError: Column values must be provided when the column doesn't exist in the dataset
```

:::

::::

It's also possible to use `init_dataset` with a dataset that has precomputed scores, for example:

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-40-ns}
```python
> train_df.columns
Index(['CreditScore', 'Gender', 'Age', 'Tenure', 'Balance', 'NumOfProducts',
       'HasCrCard', 'IsActiveMember', 'EstimatedSalary', 'Exited',
       'Geography_France', 'Geography_Germany', 'Geography_Spain'],
      dtype='object')
```
:::

::: {.w-40-ns}
```python
> train_df["my_scores"] = scores
> train_df.columns
Index(['CreditScore', 'Gender', 'Age', 'Tenure', 'Balance', 'NumOfProducts',
       'HasCrCard', 'IsActiveMember', 'EstimatedSalary', 'Exited',
       'Geography_France', 'Geography_Germany', 'Geography_Spain',
       'my_scores'],
      dtype='object')
```

:::

::::

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-50-ns}
Make sure you set the `feature_columns` correctly:

```python
vm_train_ds = vm.init_dataset(
    dataset=train_df,
    input_id="another_ds",
    feature_columns=[
        "CreditScore",
        "Gender",
        "Age",
        "Tenure",
        "Balance",
        "NumOfProducts",
        "HasCrCard",
        "IsActiveMember",
        "EstimatedSalary",
        "Exited",
        "Geography_France",
        "Geography_Germany",
        "Geography_Spain",
    ],
    target_column=customer_churn.target_column,
)
```
:::

::: {.w-40-ns}
Then, call `add_extra_column()` to register the extra column:

```python
> another_ds.add_extra_column(column_name="my_scores")
Column my_scores exists in the dataset, registering as an extra column
```

:::

::::


#### `get_extra_column()`

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-30-ns}
You can use this inside a test to retrieve the extra column values.

:::

::: {.w-60-ns}
**Example usage:**

```python
scores = self.inputs.dataset.get_extra_column("scores")
```

### Sandbox getting started

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-50-ns}
We added getting started information for the new {{< var vm.product >}} sandbox environment, which is currently available on request. You can use the sandbox to gain hands-on experience and explore what {{< var vm.product >}} has to offer.

The sandbox mimics a production environment. It includes comprehensive resources such as notebooks with sample code you can run, sample models registered in the model inventory, and draft documentation and validation reports.

Most of our model documentation features are available for you to test in the sandbox. These include:

- Automated model testing & documentation
- Preparing model validation reports
- Large language model (LLM) support

These features provide a rich context for testing and evaluation. You can use realistic models and datasets without any risk to your production environment.
