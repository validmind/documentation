PR #173: First draft for sandbox instructions
URL: https://github.com/validmind/documentation/pull/173
Labels: documentation
--->
### First draft for sandbox instructions

We added getting started information for the new ValidMind sandbox environment. You use the sandbox to gain hands-on experience and explore what ValidMind offers.

The sandbox mimics a production environment and includes comprehensive resources. These resources include notebooks with sample code you can run, sample models registered in the model inventory, and draft documentation and validation reports.

Most of our model documentation features are available for you to test in the sandbox. Features include automated model testing & documentation, preparing model validation reports, and `large_language_model` (LLM) support.

These features provide a rich context for testing and evaluation using realistic models and datasets without any risk to your production environment.
