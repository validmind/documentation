The onboarding guide tracks six common tasks that can be completed in almost any order:

You can hover over each task for more details. The guide can be minimized, leaving a trigger in the bottom right corner, or dismissed entirely. To reactivate the guide, go to **Settings** > **Profile**.

#### New model inventory and project listing display options

We've introduced new display options for search results in the **Model Inventory** and **Documentation Projects** pages:

You can easily switch between views using the **Display table** or **Display cards** toggle next to the search results.
