PR #198: Add parameter grid support in the comparison tests functionality
URL: https://github.com/validmind/validmind-library/pull/198
Labels: documentation, enhancement
--->
#### Add parameter grid support in the comparison tests functionality

We support for comparison tests using the `input_grid` parameter in `run_test` functionality. However, similar support is required for params. This feature is useful when you want to run the same test against multiple combinations of test parameters and create a single documentation block that compares the individual results.

The updated `run_test()` function allows you to pass a `param_grid`. This grid runs a test for all combinations of parameters.

Example - For this param grid:

```
param_grid = {
    "param1": [1],
    "param2": [0.1, 0.2],
}
```

A test runs once for each of the following param groups:

```
{"param1": 1, "param2": 0.1}
{"param1": 1, "param2": 0.2}
```
 
Generated PR summary: 
 
This update to the ValidMind test framework brings several enhancements and bug fixes, along with improvements to the associated Jupyter notebooks. In `quickstart_regression_full_suite.ipynb`, the `vm.init` function is modified to use `project` instead of `model`, aligning parameters with the new API structure. Additionally, in `2_run_comparison_tests.ipynb`, a new test that utilizes a `param_grid` for multiple parameter configurations has been added.

Code enhancements include updates to the `ClassifierPerformance` class, now featuring a `default_params` attribute and support for the `average` parameter in ROC AUC calculations. The `run.py` script now accommodates both parameter grids (`param_grid`) and input grids (`input_grid`) during comparison tests, enabling more flexible test configurations with various inputs and parameters. Helper functions have been introduced for validating test inputs and grid setups to enhance testing robustness.

Furthermore, unnecessary blank lines have been removed from several Python files to improve code readability. These updates aim to increase the flexibility and functionality of the ValidMind testing framework, supporting more comprehensive and varied testing scenarios.

PR #214: [SC-7262] Update RAG documentation demo notebook
URL: https://github.com/validmind/validmind-library/pull/214
Labels: enhancement
--->
#### Update RAG documentation demo notebook

Updated RAG documentation demo notebook

- Added section on generation quality 
and included the following tests:

  - `Token_Disparity`
  - `Rouge_Score`
  - `Bleu_Score`
  - `Bert_Score`
  - `Meteor_Score`

- Added section on bias and toxicity 
and the following tests:

  - `Toxicity_Score`
  - `Regard_Score`
 
Generated PR summary: 
 
This update enhances the RAG documentation demo notebook by incorporating new tests and improvements to logging functionality. The markdown section for initializing the client library now contains detailed instructions for obtaining and using the ValidMind code snippet for model registration and connection. Additionally, the `punkt_tab` resource is downloaded to support tokenization tasks. The `.log()` method is added to several test invocations for proper result logging.

Several new tests are introduced to evaluate the quality of the RAG model's outputs. These include tests for cosine similarity distribution, token disparity between generated and reference texts, and evaluation metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, BERT, and METEOR scores. Tests also assess potential issues like toxicity and regard scores in generated responses. Furthermore, the notebook's kernel specification is updated to use Python 3.10.

These enhancements aim to improve the robustness and comprehensiveness of the RAG model evaluation process by ensuring better alignment with reference outputs and identifying potential biases or quality issues you might encounter.

Generated PR summary: 
 
This update includes a comprehensive refactor of the UI components and styling throughout the application. You will notice that custom button components have been replaced with Chakra UI's `Button` component, and various elements now use Chakra UI's typography components for a consistent style. Unused components and storybook examples have been removed to streamline the codebase.

The styling has been enhanced with a new theme configuration featuring custom colors, fonts, and styles, including a revamped color palette for brand and neutral tones. Button styles have been updated with new variants such as `primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary`, and `ghost`, along with standardized font sizes and weights for headings and text.

Additionally, new storybook stories have been added to showcase different button variants and states, while outdated examples have been cleaned up. The code has undergone significant cleanup, with redundant CSS files removed and simpler component imports implemented.

Overall, these changes improve the maintainability and consistency of the UI components, facilitating easier future design updates and ensuring a cohesive look across the application.

The user interface has been enhanced by updating the `ManageAttachmentsField` component, allowing you to add and remove notes (descriptions) for attachments. This includes a new `NoteState` type to manage note states and modifications to the `FileDisplay` component, enabling you to display and edit notes. A vertical stack (`VStack`) is implemented to support the new note features, along with a menu that provides options for adding/removing notes and deleting files. Additionally, the `entity_attachments.ts` model now includes an optional `description` field in the `EntityAttachmentFile` type for storing attachment descriptions.

#### Implement filtering and sorting features on historical test runs component

Filtering and sorting on historical test runs

Added the ability to filter and sort historical test runs. This improvement enhances data navigation and analysis.
 
Generated PR summary: 
 
This update brings several enhancements and bug fixes focused on API improvements and UI component updates. You can now use the new function `GetTestResultsFiltersForProject` to fetch filter options for test results. The existing API functions `GetMetricHistoryForProject` and `GetTestResultHistoryForProject` have been updated to accept additional parameters for more flexible filtering and sorting. A new type, `TFiltersResult`, is introduced to define the structure of filter results. On the UI side, the `DataTable` component has a streamlined sorting logic, while the `InputInfoModal` now supports filtering and sorting of history data with a new `TestResultsFilter` component for selecting filters. Updates to the `MetricContent` and `TestResultContent` components allow them to pass new filtering and sorting parameters to the API. Additionally, console log statements have been removed from various components, and utility functions in `utils.ts` have been refactored to include new date conversion functions and a query parameter generator. These changes enhance user experience by providing more versatile data filtering choices and improve codebase maintainability.

Generated PR summary: 
 
This update brings several enhancements and new features to attachment management in the project. The `ManageAttachmentsField` component has been refactored to export types like `NoteState`, `RemoveAttachmentDetails`, and `RemoveAttachmentModalProps`, improving type management and reusability. Some components now use named exports for consistency and easier imports. A new `CustomAttachments` component is added, allowing you to manage attachments within custom fields with functionalities for file uploads, deletions, and displaying file information. This component integrates with the `InventoryModelContext`, uses `Auth0` for authentication, employs feature flag management via `useFlags`, and supports user notifications through `useToast`. 

The `FileDisplay` component has seen improvements to handle additional props and enhance user interaction, including options like opening files in a new tab and managing notes. An optional `canAddNote` prop allows conditional rendering of note-related actions. The integration of the `CustomAttachments` component into the `CustomFieldRenderer` enables its use as a custom field type, with updates made to include the new `attachments` type in the list of custom field types.

Additional improvements include enhancing the `pickProperties` utility function for better type safety, removing unnecessary loading states in the `WorkflowStatusFormModal`, and improving sorting logic in the `FieldForm` to sort available fields by title. These changes are designed to enhance flexibility and usability, providing a more robust and user-friendly experience in managing attachments within the application.

#### Support for `datetime` manipulation in inventory fields

You can now use the following date/date-time-related functions in calculated fields:

- time
- date
- datetime
- `timedelta`
- `relativedelta`

Example formula using `date` and `relativedelta`:

```python
def formula(params):
    """ 
    Calculate the next review date based on the approval date and review frequency.

    Args:
        params.dmApprovedDate (str): The approval date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
        params.dmRiskTier (string): The review tier (Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3).

    Returns:
        datetime: The next review date.
    """
    
    # Guard against empty dates
    if params.dmApprovedDate == "":
        return "N/A"
    
    # Convert the approved_date string to a datetime object
    approved_date = date.fromtimestamp((int(params.dmApprovedDate) or 0) / 1000)
    
    # Define the review frequency mapping
    review_frequency = {
        "Tier 1": relativedelta(months=3),  # Quarterly
        "Tier 2": relativedelta(months=6),  # Semi-annually
        "Tier 3": relativedelta(years=1)   # Annually
    }
    
    # Get the appropriate timedelta based on the tier
    frequency = review_frequency.get(params.dmRiskTier)
    
    if not frequency:
        return "N/A"
    
    # Calculate the next review date
    next_review_date = approved_date + frequency
    
    return next_review_date.isoformat()
```

Generated PR summary: 
 
This update improves the `UserRoleTable` and `Templates` components. In the `UserRoleTable`, the logic for displaying user roles is simplified by removing a redundant conditional check, as roles are already filtered by organization through the `getUserRolesForOrg` function. The rendering of the `RolePill` component is also streamlined for better readability and maintainability. In the `Templates` component, the "Last Updated" column now shows the creation date of the most recent version when available. This provides more accurate information about template updates, enhancing your user experience.

Generated PR summary: 
 
This release enhances the `AddUserRolesModal` component by improving how role pills are displayed in the web application. The update involves replacing the `HStack` component with the `Wrap` component from Chakra UI, allowing for better handling of roles when there is limited space, resulting in a more responsive and flexible user interface. Specifically, in `RolesPicker.tsx`, the `HStack` now includes `flexWrap={"wrap"}` to enable this functionality. Similarly, in `index.tsx`, the use of `Wrap` ensures a more adaptable layout for displaying selected roles. Additionally, minor formatting adjustments have been made to improve code readability. These changes are intended to enhance your user experience by ensuring role pills display effectively even if they exceed available horizontal space.

#### Updated validator training

We expanded our validator training and user guide. It includes more guidance for tracking and resolving issues identified in model findings. 
 
Generated PR summary: 
 
This update introduces several enhancements and bug fixes to the ValidMind documentation and training templates. You now have access to new course templates for Administrator Fundamentals, Developer Fundamentals, and Validator Fundamentals. These templates offer structured learning paths tailored to different roles within the ValidMind platform and include sections for learning objectives, course content, and registration details. They also incorporate support and feedback mechanisms via Slack and email.

The documentation has been updated for improved clarity and consistency. For example, instructions now specify "Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it" instead of simply "Select a model by clicking on it". Additionally, navigation links and file paths are revised to align with the new course structures.

Site navigation modifications include integrating new training paths and updating links accordingly. The `_quarto.yml` file is adjusted to accommodate changes in the training section, while iframe links in `index.qmd` now direct you to the new course pages.

A new section is added for tracking issue resolution during the validation process, offering guidance on assessing open issues and determining their severity. These updates aim to improve user experience by providing clearer guidance and structured learning paths based on user roles.
