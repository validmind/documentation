The ValidMind documentation site Docker image now supports full customization for white-label deployments and branded environments.

**Configurable branding & URLs**

- You can now customize product names in both long and short forms.
- Replace the ValidMind logo and favicon with your own SVG assets.
- Configure custom URLs for your ValidMind platform and JupyterHub instances. Configuration is managed through a Kubernetes ConfigMap, allowing for easy customization.

**Local development support**

- Integrate Kind (Kubernetes in Docker) for local testing.
- Use simple `make` commands to set up a local Kubernetes environment.
- Access real-time log viewing and cluster management.

For detailed setup instructions and configuration options, refer to [Local Kubernetes development with Kind](/README.md#local-kubernetes-development-with-kind). For a sample configuration, see [`validmind-docs.yaml`](/site/validmind-docs.yaml).

<!--- DEBUG INFORMATION
INITIAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
ASSESSMENT:
The main issues identified in the content include the presence of Markdown headings that need conversion to bold text, references to internal development processes that should be removed, and some verbose language that could be streamlined for clarity. There is no duplication between the PR summary and external notes since the PR summary is absent. The content is otherwise well-organized and clear.

PASS_1_INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Remove Internal Content**: Eliminate any references to internal development processes, such as "Configuration handled through a Kubernetes ConfigMap that gets generated at build time," as this pertains to internal automation.
2. **Convert Markdown Headings**: Change the Markdown headings in the external notes to bold text. For example, convert `**Configurable branding & URLs**` and `**Local development support**` to bold text without the Markdown heading syntax.

PASS_2_INSTRUCTIONS:
- No changes needed. The content does not have overlapping introductory paragraphs or duplication issues since the PR summary is absent.

PASS_3_INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Streamline Language**: Simplify verbose language for clarity. For example, rephrase "New Kind (Kubernetes in Docker) integration for local testing" to "Integrate Kind (Kubernetes in Docker) for local testing."
2. **Ensure Proper Punctuation**: Verify that all sentences end with periods and adjust as necessary.
3. **Improve Flow**: Ensure the content flows logically and cohesively, maintaining technical accuracy and clarity without adding new content.

FINAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
DETAILED ASSESSMENT:
STATUS: PASS  
ISSUE: None  
RECOMMENDATION: None

Loop 1: RETURN_TO_PASS_1
Issue: The final edited content has a structural issue where the mention of "Configuration handled through a Kubernetes ConfigMap that gets generated at build time" from the original content was removed. This could lead to confusion about how the customization is implemented.
Recommendation: Reinstate the information about the Kubernetes ConfigMap to clarify how configuration is managed for customization.

Loop 2: PASS
Issue: None
Recommendation: Content quality acceptable
