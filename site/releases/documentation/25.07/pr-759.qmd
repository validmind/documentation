This update enhances workflow documentation and configuration, providing a more streamlined and user-friendly experience. The "Model Workflows" section in the Guides has been restructured into concise guides, improving readability by reducing interruptions from examples. All examples are now consolidated on a single page titled "Workflow configuration examples," simplifying the instructional experience and easing maintenance.

**Other adjustments**

The global sidebar width has been increased to provide more space for links. Additionally, the `Guides` sidebar links have been organized into their own `_sidebar.yaml` file for better structure.

To complement the updated workflow functionality, the section on model workflows in the user guides has been renovated. You can now learn how to configure workflows to match your organizational needs for overseeing model development, validation, implementation, ongoing monitoring, auditing, or other risk management activities. Once customized, use workflows to transition your models into their appropriate next stages throughout their lifecycles.
