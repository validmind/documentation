We've revamped the quickstart experience for model developers to provide a user-friendly introduction to documenting models with ValidMind. This update guides you through the basics of using ValidMind to develop models, including how to register your first model, use the `ValidMind Library` to run tests and document a model, and review your generated model documentation on the ValidMind platform.

This quickstart is the first in a series of new user journeys. Stay tuned for upcoming guides on model validation and platform administration!

<!--- DEBUG INFORMATION
INITIAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
ASSESSMENT:
The main issues identified in the content are duplication between the PR summary and external notes, and the presence of verbose language. The external notes provide a more detailed and user-focused explanation of the changes, which should be prioritized. There is no presence of Markdown headings or internal content references that need removal.

PASS_1_INSTRUCTIONS:
- Remove any references to CI/CD workflows, GitHub Actions, build processes, deployment pipelines, or internal automation if present. None found in this content, so no changes needed here.

PASS_2_INSTRUCTIONS:
- Consolidate the PR summary and external notes by removing the PR summary, as the external notes provide a more comprehensive and user-focused description of the changes. 
- Ensure the external notes are the primary focus and opening statement, as they provide the necessary context and detail about the update.

PASS_3_INSTRUCTIONS:
- Simplify any verbose language in the external notes to ensure clarity and conciseness. For example, rephrase "aiming to present a more user-friendly introduction to using ValidMind for documenting models" to "to provide a user-friendly introduction to documenting models with ValidMind."
- Ensure all sentences are clear and end with periods.
- Convert any Markdown headings to bold text if present. No headings found, so no changes needed here.
