You now have access to a new quickstart for model validators, offering an introduction to using ValidMind for model validation. This quickstart guides you through using the ValidMind Library to run tests, evaluate a champion model, and add your test results as evidence to your validation report within the ValidMind platform.

This quickstart is the second in a series of new user journeys. Stay tuned for our upcoming guide for platform administration!

<!--- DEBUG INFORMATION
INITIAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
ASSESSMENT:
The main issues in the content include duplication between the PR summary and external notes, as well as the presence of verbose language. There are no Markdown headings to convert, and no internal content references that need removal. The external notes provide a more comprehensive and user-focused explanation compared to the PR summary.

PASS_1_INSTRUCTIONS:
- Remove the PR summary entirely as it is redundant and less informative compared to the external notes.
- Ensure that all sentences end with periods and maintain proper punctuation throughout the text.

PASS_2_INSTRUCTIONS:
- Since the PR summary is removed in Pass 1, focus on ensuring that the remaining content from the external notes is clear and concise. No further deduplication is needed as the external notes are distinct and comprehensive.

PASS_3_INSTRUCTIONS:
- Simplify any verbose language in the external notes to enhance clarity. For example, rephrase "a user-friendly introduction to using ValidMind for validating models" to "an introduction to using ValidMind for model validation."
- Break up any overly long sentences to improve readability. For instance, consider splitting the sentence that begins with "This quickstart covers the basics..." into two sentences for better flow.
- Ensure all sentences are clear and direct, using simple language while maintaining technical accuracy.
