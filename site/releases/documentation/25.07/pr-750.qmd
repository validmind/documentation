We've introduced a new quickstart experience for model validation, providing an easy introduction to ValidMind. This update guides you through using the ValidMind Library to test and evaluate a champion model. You'll learn to add your test results as evidence in your validation report on the ValidMind platform.

This quickstart is the second in a series of new user journeys. Stay tuned for our upcoming guide for platform administration!
