<!---feat: improvements to groups by @sammusaev in [#627](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/627)--->
feat: improvements to groups
: Added ability to create new groups
- Added ability to add members during group creation
- Added ability to see what models are visible to a group

One minor thing we discovered during UAT was that it's possible to create a group with a single blank space character as its name. Do let us know if this is something we'd like to prevent users from doing.

<!---Apply changes from juan5508/sc-3259/Create-Metric-V2-class by @nrichers in [#1](https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/1)--->
Apply changes from juan5508/sc-3259/Create-Metric-V2-class
: This pull request introduces the Unit Metric feature, a new single value measure designed to streamline the risk assessment process in Machine Learning and AI model development. The Unit Metric simplifies complex evidence into actionable insights, allowing for efficient monitoring and comparison of risks across different models or datasets.

Example: 
```
metric_id = "validmind.unit_metrics.sklearn.classification.F1"

inputs = {
    "model": vm_model,
    "dataset": vm_test_ds
}

result = vm.unit_metrics.run_metric(
    metric_id=metric_id, 
    inputs=inputs,
)
result.value
```
```
>>> 0.5709401709401709
```
```
result.summary
```
```
>>> {'f1': 0.5709401709401709}
```




**Changes**
- Implemented the `UnitMetric` class.
- Implemented sklearn classification metrics as unit metrics: `F1`, `Accuracy`, `Precision`, `Recall` and `ROC_AUC`
- Added `vm.unit_metrics.run_metric` to the ValidMind client library to support running metrics. 

**Testing**
- Provided a notebook on defining, executing, and extracting results from Unit Metrics using a customer churn use case. See `run_unit_metrics.ipynb`


<!---Added Report and fixed chart colors by @even-steven in [#591](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/591)--->
Added Report and fixed chart colors
: Added new report: Findings by Model


<!---Panchicore/sc 3001/remove documentation projects from the UI by @panchicore in [#569](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/569)--->
Panchicore/sc 3001/remove documentation projects from the UI
: ValidMind's new navigational pattern provides a clear path for users to find Model's documentation by first identifying the Model they are interested in and once they are in the context of that Model, then select its documentation or validation report.

All actions and general information related to the Model's documentation has been moved to a new page "Document Overview"   (formerly Documentation Project Detail page) 

This should make navigation much clearer from the moment users land on the dashboard, giving users a single path of entry (Model Inventory) instead of two (Model Inventory & Documentation Projects)


<!---[SC-3255] adding SSO login option to auth flow by @jamadriz in [#579](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/579)--->
[SC-3255] adding SSO login option to auth flow
: Single Sign On (SSO) allows enterprise organizations to have a centralized authentication mechanism, more integrated control over internal applications, and integration with existing identity management systems such as Google Workspace, LDAP or Active Directory. It also provides more enhanced security and customization control over authentication processes according to the organization's security policies and compliance requirements. 

In this release, we are incorporating (under release flag) the option to Login to ValidMind using SSO. 

In order for this feature to apply to an organization, we must configure our Auth0 authentication provider to integrate with the organization's identity provider, following this general high level steps:

* Create an Auth0 Enterprise SAML Connection to the Organization's Identity Provider
* Configure the Organizations Identity Provider, and add a new SSO Application for ValidMind
* Enable this on ValidMInd's backend by associating the domain and the Auth0 SAML Connection to the Organization


<!---Findings & Reports Tab by @even-steven in [#585](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/585)--->
Findings & Reports Tab
: Added a new Tab in the Sidenav called Reports. This tab shows charts of various analytics across the organization.
- Added a new Tab in the Sidenav called Model Findings. This tab allows you to view and filter Findings across the entire organization.
- Also added the ability to click a Report in the Reports tab to jump to the relevant Model Findings.
