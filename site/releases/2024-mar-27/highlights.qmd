## Release highlights

This extensive release brings many improvements ValidMind, from the display of new metadata for test results in the {{< var vm.developer >}}, to two new core features of {{< var vm.platform >}} — **Model Findings** and **Reports** pages, and many more!

### {{< var validmind.developer >}} (v2.0.0)

<!---Display result metadata on the UI by @even-steven in [#607](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/607)--->
#### View test results metadata

New test metadata available in the {{< var validmind.platform >}} makes it easy to see information about the test results that were generated with the {{< var validmind.developer >}}. Test results metadata includes:

- The history of values for test results in your model documentation
- User attribution to tell you who updated the test results
- Relevant inputs associated with the test results

Test results metadata is available directly in your model documentation:

### {{< var validmind.platform >}} (v1.18.4)

<!---Findings & Reports Tab by @even-steven in [#585](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/585)--->
#### New Model Findings & Reports pages

We're introducing two important new features to our platform: the **Model Findings** and **Reports** pages. The **Reports** page offers access to essential information about your model validation efforts, summarizing findings, while the **Model Findings** page facilitates efficient tracking of issues identified during model validation. Together, these pages improve your model validation workflow and simplify compliance with organizational standards and regulatory requirements.

| New Model Findings page | New Reports page |
|----------|----------|
| ![](model-findings-page.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the new Model Findings page showing a table of findings that can be clicked on"} | ![](reports-page.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the new Reports page showing several tiles with bar charts that can be clicked on"} |

The new **Model Findings** page allows you to efficiently track all findings flagged during model validation, such as major and minor issues, deficiencies, model limitations, or other concerns that must be addressed. To facilitate working with findings across all models undergoing validation in your organization, you can filter and view findings by specific criteria, including:

- Inventory model
- Severity 
- Status
- Risk area
- Assignee
- Due date

The new **Reports** page provides quick insights into your model validation efforts to ensure effective oversight and management of model-related risks. Reports are grouped into bar charts for different types of findings, including:

- Findings by risk area
- Findings by business unit
- Findings by status
- Findings by model

Additionally, you can seamlessly navigate between the **Reports** page and relevant model findings by selecting information from the available bar charts to drill down into specific areas of concern.

Try it: 

- [Model Findings]({{< var url.us1 >}}/model-findings)
- [Reports]({{< var url.us1 >}}/reports)

<!---Model inventory select and persist table columns by @even-steven in [#667](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/667)--->
<!---Model Findings table columns and sorting by @even-steven in [#615](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/615)--->
#### Model Inventory and Model Findings page customization

We enhanced both the **Model Inventory** and **Model Findings** pages to allow for the customization of table views. This feature enables you to customize these pages according to your own preferences, so that specific columns that are of interest are always shown. Columns can also be sorted by clicking on the column header.

On the **Model Inventory** page, you can show or hide table columns by clicking the **Manage Columns** button and toggling individual columns on or off:

<video src="/assets/video/releases/model-inventory-manage-columns.mp4" controls alt="A video that demonstrates how you can show or hide table columns on the Model Inventory page by clicking the Manage Columns button and toggling individual columns on or off." style="width: 80%; border: 4px solid #333; box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px #ccc, -5px 5px 5px #ccc; border-radius: 5px;">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.

The same customization is available on the **Model Findings** page:

![](model-findings-manage-columns.png){width=80% fig-alt="A screenshot that highlights how you can show or hide table columns on the Model Findings page by clicking the Manage Columns button and toggling individual columns on or off"}

Try it: 

- [Model Inventory]({{< var url.us1 >}}/model-inventory)
- [Model Findings]({{< var url.us1 >}}/model-findings)

<!---Additional Fields during Model Registration by @even-steven in [#628](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/628)--->
#### Additional fields for model registration

When registering new models in the model inventory, you can now designate additional fields as mandatory. Users must complete these additional fields before they can proceed with registering a model. This feature ensures that all necessary information is provided upfront, improving the completeness and accuracy of the model registration process.

You can specify the inventory fields that are required under **{{< fa gear >}} Settings** > **Model Inventory Fields**:

<video src="/assets/video/releases/required-inventory-fields.mp4" controls alt="A video that demonstrates how you can add additional fields under Settings > Model Inventory Fields." style="width: 80%; border: 4px solid #333; box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px #ccc, -5px 5px 5px #ccc; border-radius: 5px;">

<!---[VALIDMIND-166] Exclude accepted invites from Pending Invites table by @sammusaev in [#634](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/634)--->
#### User management improvements

We made a number of improvements to how you manage user groups:

- Added support for the creation of new groups
- Enabled the addition of members during group creation
- Added a section to show what models are visible to a group
- Included the assigned groups to user profile pages

These improvements enable you to manage collections of users at the organization or team level with similar roles or permissions more effectively.

You can create new user groups under **{{< fa gear >}} Settings** > **Groups**:

<video src="/assets/video/releases/create-new-group.mp4" controls alt="A video that demonstrates how you can create new user groups under Settings > Groups." style="width: 80%; border: 4px solid #333; box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px #ccc, -5px 5px 5px #ccc; border-radius: 5px;">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video><br>

Try it: [Groups]({{< var url.us1 >}}/settings/groups)

We also made improvements to how the invitation history gets displayed when you add new users to your organization:

- Added an **Invite History** table to show accepted invitations
- Renamed the existing table to **Pending Invites** and updated it to show only users that have not yet accepted

Combined, these changes make it easier to see both pending and accepted invitations for new users joining your organization:

![](user-invite-history.png){width=80% fig-alt="A screenshot that highlights the user invitation history, showing both pending and accepted invitations to join your organization"}

Try it: [Invite New Users]({{< var url.us1 >}}/settings/invitation)

## Enhancements

<!---[SC-3255] adding SSO login option to auth flow by @jamadriz in [#579](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/579)--->
Added SSO login option to auth flow
: In this release, we are introducing the option to log in to ValidMind using SSO. Single sign on (SSO) allows your enterprise organizations to have a centralized authentication mechanism, more integrated control over internal applications, and integration with existing identity management systems, such as Google Workspace, LDAP or Active Directory. 

In order for this feature to be enabled for your organization, we can configure our Auth0 authentication provider to integrate with your organization's identity provider. The steps required to make SSO available include:

1. Creating an Auth0 Enterprise SAML connection to your organization's identity provider
2. Configuring your organizations identity provider and adding a new SSO application for ValidMind
3. Enabling SSO on the ValidMind backend by associating the domain and the Auth0 SAML connection with your organization

<!---Apply changes from juan5508/sc-3259/Create-Metric-V2-class by @nrichers in [#1](https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/1)--->
<!--- NR Commented out as per Slack convo with Andres
Apply changes from juan5508/sc-3259/Create-Metric-V2-class
: This pull request introduces the Unit Metric feature, a new single value measure designed to streamline the risk assessment process in Machine Learning and AI model development. The Unit Metric simplifies complex evidence into actionable insights, allowing for efficient monitoring and comparison of risks across different models or datasets.

Example: 
```python
metric_id = "validmind.unit_metrics.sklearn.classification.F1"

inputs = {
    "model": vm_model,
    "dataset": vm_test_ds
}

result = vm.unit_metrics.run_metric(
    metric_id=metric_id, 
    inputs=inputs,
)
result.value
```
```python
>>> 0.5709401709401709
```
```python
result.summary
```
```python
>>> {'f1': 0.5709401709401709}
```

**Changes**
- Implemented the `UnitMetric` class.
- Implemented sklearn classification metrics as unit metrics: `F1`, `Accuracy`, `Precision`, `Recall` and `ROC_AUC`
- Added `vm.unit_metrics.run_metric` to the ValidMind client library to support running metrics. 

**Testing**
- Provided a notebook on defining, executing, and extracting results from Unit Metrics using a customer churn use case. See `run_unit_metrics.ipynb`

<!---Panchicore/sc 3001/remove documentation projects from the UI by @panchicore in [#569](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/569)--->
Removed documentation projects from the UI
: Documentation projects have been removed from the {{< var validmind.platform >}}, streamlining navigation for accessing model documentation. You can now easily locate a model of interest and then access its documentation or validation report directly within the context of that model. 

This change aims to improve navigation by providing you with a single entry point from the **Model Inventory** page. Previously, both the **Model Inventory** and the **Documentation Projects** pages offered similar navigation pathways which were redundant. All actions and information previously available for model documentation or validation reports continue to be available, now on the **Document Overview** page.

## Bug fixes

<!---fix: user permissions settings menu showing when user doesn't have customer admin role by @wkm97 in [#646](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/646)--->
User permissions settings menu shown for users without the correct role
: We fixed an issue where the user permissions settings menu was displayed even when a user did not possess the required `Customer admin` role. The menu is now hidden from view for these users.

<!---[SC3129] UI not showing the correct message in text by @cachafla in [#616](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/616)--->
UI showing incorrect message to edit text
: Fixed an issue where users would see a message reading "Start editing by typing here ..." even when they didn't have permissions to edit documentation for the given model. This message is now no longer displayed.
