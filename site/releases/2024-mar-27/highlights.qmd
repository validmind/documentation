### Model Inventory and Model Findings customization

the customization of the table views for both Model Inventory, and Model Findings pages. This includes both showing/hiding a column as well as rearranging the order in which it

We enhanced the **Model Inventory** page to give you the option to display or conceal table columns. This change enables you to customize the page to your preference, for example to include specific columns of specific interest to you or your team. 

You can display or conceal table columns by clicking the **Manage Columns** button and toggling individual columns on or off:

## Enhancements

<!---[SC-3255] adding SSO login option to auth flow by @jamadriz in [#579](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/579)--->
Added SSO login option to auth flow
: Single sign on (SSO) allows your enterprise organizations to have a centralized authentication mechanism, more integrated control over internal applications, and integration with existing identity management systems, such as Google Workspace, LDAP or Active Directory. It also provides more enhanced security and customization control over authentication processes according to the organization's security policies and compliance requirements. 

In this release, we are introducing the option to log in to ValidMind using SSO. 

In order for this feature to apply to an organization, we must configure our Auth0 authentication provider to integrate with the organization's identity provider, following this general high level steps:

* Create an Auth0 Enterprise SAML Connection to the organization's identity provider
* Configure the Organizations Identity Provider, and add a new SSO application for ValidMind
* Enable this on ValidMInd's backend by associating the domain and the Auth0 SAML Connection to the Organization

<!---Added Report and fixed chart colors by @even-steven in [#591](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/591)

<!---Apply changes from juan5508/sc-3259/Create-Metric-V2-class by @nrichers in [#1](https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/1)--->
<!--- NR Commented out as per Slack convo with Andres
Apply changes from juan5508/sc-3259/Create-Metric-V2-class
: This pull request introduces the Unit Metric feature, a new single value measure designed to streamline the risk assessment process in Machine Learning and AI model development. The Unit Metric simplifies complex evidence into actionable insights, allowing for efficient monitoring and comparison of risks across different models or datasets.

Example: 
```
metric_id = "validmind.unit_metrics.sklearn.classification.F1"

inputs = {
    "model": vm_model,
    "dataset": vm_test_ds
}

result = vm.unit_metrics.run_metric(
    metric_id=metric_id, 
    inputs=inputs,
)
result.value
```
```
>>> 0.5709401709401709
```
```
result.summary
```
```
>>> {'f1': 0.5709401709401709}
```

**Changes**
- Implemented the `UnitMetric` class.
- Implemented sklearn classification metrics as unit metrics: `F1`, `Accuracy`, `Precision`, `Recall` and `ROC_AUC`
- Added `vm.unit_metrics.run_metric` to the ValidMind client library to support running metrics. 

**Testing**
- Provided a notebook on defining, executing, and extracting results from Unit Metrics using a customer churn use case. See `run_unit_metrics.ipynb`

<!---Panchicore/sc 3001/remove documentation projects from the UI by @panchicore in [#569](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/569)--->
Removed documentation projects from the UI
: Documentation projects have been removed from the ValidMind Platform UI, streamlining navigation for accessing model documentation. You can now easily locate a model of interest and then access its documentation or validation report directly within the context of that model. 

This change aims to improve navigation by providing you with a single entry point from the **Model Inventory** page. Previously, both the **Model Inventory** and the **Documentation Projects** pages offered similar navigation pathways which were redundant. All actions and information previously available for model documentation or validation reports continue to be available, as before.

## Bug fixes

<!---fix: user permissions settings menu showing when user doesn't have customer admin role by @wkm97 in [#646](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/646)--->
User permissions settings menu shown for users without the 'Customer admin' role
: We fixed an issue where the user permissions settings menu was displayed even when a user did not possess the required `Customer admin` role. The menu is now hidden from view for these users.

<!---[SC3129] UI not showing the correct message in text by @cachafla in [#616](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/616)--->
UI not showing the correct message in text
: Fixed an issue where users would see a message reading "Start editing by typing here ..." even when they didn't have permissions to edit documentation for the given model. This message is now no longer displayed.

Use input_id to track inputs being accessed
: Fixed a bug where input metadata was not tracked correctly because `input_id` was not being used to look up inputs. Input metadata is now tracked as expected.

## Documentation updates

<!---Guides section rework by @nrichers in [#152](https://github.com/validmind/documentation/pull/152)--->
Improved Guides section
: The main user guides section of our documentation site now features a new landing page that organizes common tasks by product area to assist with setting up ValidMind in a production environment. A redesigned left sidebar enhances navigation through content by product area or major feature, simplifying the search for relevant information based on your role or interest in specific product features.
