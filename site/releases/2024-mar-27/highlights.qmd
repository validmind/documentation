## Release highlights

This extensive release brings many improvements {{< var vm.product >}}, from the display of new metadata for test results in the {{< var vm.developer >}}, to two new core features of {{< var vm.platform >}} — **Model Findings** and **{{< fa square-poll-vertical >}} Analytics** pages, and many more!

### {{< var validmind.developer >}} (v2.0.0)

<!---Display result metadata on the UI by @even-steven in [#607](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/607)--->
#### View test result metadata

New test metadata available in the {{< var validmind.platform >}} makes it easy to see information about the test results that were generated with the {{< var validmind.developer >}}. 

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-40-ns}

Test result metadata includes:

- The history of values for test results in your model documentation
- User attribution to tell you who updated the test results
- Relevant inputs associated with the test results

[View test result metadata](/developer/model-documentation/work-with-test-results.qmd#view-test-result-metadata){.button}

### {{< var validmind.platform >}} (v1.18.4)

<!---Findings & Reports Tab by @even-steven in [#585](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/585)--->
#### New Model Findings & Reports pages

We're introducing two important new features to the {{< var validmind.platform >}}: 

- **Model Findings** 
- **{{< fa square-poll-vertical >}} Analytics** 

The **{{< fa square-poll-vertical >}} Analytics** page offers access to essential information about your model validation efforts, summarizing findings, while the **Model Findings** page facilitates efficient tracking of issues identified during model validation. Together, these pages improve your model validation workflow and simplify compliance with organizational standards and regulatory requirements.

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-40-ns}

##### Model Findings

![New Model Findings page with a table of clickable findings](model-findings-page.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the new Model Findings page showing a table of findings that can be clicked on" .screenshot}

The new **Model Findings** page allows you to efficiently track all findings flagged during model validation, such as major and minor issues, deficiencies, model limitations, or other concerns that must be addressed. 

To facilitate working with findings across all models undergoing validation in your organization, you can filter and view findings by specific criteria, including:

- Inventory model
- Severity 
- Status
- Risk area
- Assignee
- Due date

[View and filter model findings](/guide/model-validation/view-filter-model-findings.qmd){.button}

::: {.w-40-ns}

##### Reports

![New Reports page with clickable bar chart tiles](reports-page.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the new Reports page showing several tiles with bar charts that can be clicked on" .screenshot}

The new **{{< fa square-poll-vertical >}} Analytics** page provides quick insights into your model validation efforts to ensure effective oversight and management of model-related risks. 

Reports are grouped into bar charts for different types of findings, including:

- Findings by risk area
- Findings by business unit
- Findings by status
- Findings by model

Additionally, you can seamlessly navigate between the **{{< fa square-poll-vertical >}} Analytics** page and relevant model findings by selecting information from the available bar charts to drill down into specific areas of concern.

<!---Additional Fields during Model Registration by @even-steven in [#628](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/628)--->
#### Additional required fields on model registration

When registering new models in the model inventory, you can now designate additional fields as mandatory. 

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-50-ns}
- Users must complete these additional fields before they can proceed with registering a model. 
- This feature ensures that all necessary information is provided upfront, improving the completeness and accuracy of the model registration process.

:::

::: {.w-40-ns}

You can specify the inventory fields that are [required on registration]{.smallcaps} under **{{< fa gear >}} Settings** > **Model Inventory Fields**.

#### User management improvements

##### User groups

We made a number of improvements to how you manage user groups:

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-50-ns}
- Added support for the creation of new groups
- Enabled the addition of members during group creation
- Added a section to show what models are visible to a group
- Included the assigned groups to user profile pages

:::

::: {.w-40-ns}

You can create new user groups under **{{< fa gear >}} Settings** > **Groups**.

These improvements enable you to manage collections of users at the organization or team level with similar roles or permissions more effectively.

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-50-ns}

##### User invitation history

We also made improvements to how the invitation history gets displayed when you add new users to your organization:

- Added an **Invite History** table to show accepted invitations
- Renamed the existing table to **Pending Invites** and updated it to show only users that have not yet accepted

Combined, these changes make it easier to see both pending and accepted invitations for new users joining your organization.

## Enhancements

<!---[SC-3255] adding SSO login option to auth flow by @jamadriz in [#579](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/579)--->

#### Added SSO login option to auth flow

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-70-ns}
We introduced the option to log in to {{< var vm.product >}} using SSO. 

:::

::: {.w-30-ns .tl}

[Log in to {{< var vm.product >}}](/guide/configuration/log-in-to-validmind.qmd){.button}

:::

::::

Single sign on (SSO) allows your enterprise organizations to have a centralized authentication mechanism, more integrated control over internal applications, and integration with existing identity management systems, such as Google Workspace, LDAP or Active Directory.

In order for this feature to be enabled for your organization, we can configure our Auth0 authentication provider to integrate with your organization's identity provider. The steps required to make SSO available include:

1. Creating an Auth0 Enterprise SAML connection to your organization's identity provider
2. Configuring your organizations identity provider and adding a new SSO application for {{< var vm.product >}}
3. Enabling SSO on the {{< var vm.product >}} backend by associating the domain and the Auth0 SAML connection with your organization

<!--- NR Commented out as per Slack convo with Andres
Apply changes from juan5508/sc-3259/Create-Metric-V2-class
: This pull request introduces the Unit Metric feature, a new single value measure designed to streamline the risk assessment process in Machine Learning and AI model development. The Unit Metric simplifies complex evidence into actionable insights, allowing for efficient monitoring and comparison of risks across different models or datasets.

Example: 
```python
metric_id = "validmind.unit_metrics.sklearn.classification.F1"

inputs = {
    "model": vm_model,
    "dataset": vm_test_ds
}

result = vm.unit_metrics.run_metric(
    metric_id=metric_id, 
    inputs=inputs,
)
result.value
```
```python
>>> 0.5709401709401709
```
```python
result.summary
```
```python
>>> {'f1': 0.5709401709401709}
```

**Changes**
- Implemented the `UnitMetric` class.
- Implemented sklearn classification metrics as unit metrics: `F1`, `Accuracy`, `Precision`, `Recall` and `ROC_AUC`
- Added `vm.unit_metrics.run_metric` to the ValidMind Library to support running metrics. 

**Testing**
- Provided a notebook on defining, executing, and extracting results from Unit Metrics using a customer churn use case. See `run_unit_metrics.ipynb`

<!---Panchicore/sc 3001/remove documentation projects from the UI by @panchicore in [#569](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/569)--->

#### Removed documentation projects from the UI

Documentation projects have been removed from the {{< var validmind.platform >}}, streamlining navigation for accessing model documentation. You can now easily locate a model of interest and then access its documentation or validation report directly within the context of that model. 

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-60-ns}
- This change aims to improve navigation by providing you with a single entry point from the **{{< fa cubes >}} Model Inventory** page.
