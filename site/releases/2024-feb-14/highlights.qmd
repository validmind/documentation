## Release highlights

### ValidMind Developer Framework (v1.26.6)

<!---[SC-2706] Documentation templates should allow rendering more than one unique metric result for the same metric by @AnilSorathiya in [#322](https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/322)--->
#### Documentation templates now support tracking each metric result with a unique identifier

Documentation templates have been updated to support logging each metric run as a unique result, making it possible to run the same test across different datasets or models. To make use of this new feature, you simply add a unique `result_id` identifier as a suffix to a `content_id` identifier in the content block definition of a `metric` or `test` content type. 

For example, the following content blocks with the suffixes `training_data` and `test_data` enable you to log two individual results for the same test `validmind.data_validation.Skewness`:

```yaml
- content_type: test
  content_id: validmind.data_validation.Skewness:training_data
- content_type: metric
  content_id: validmind.data_validation.Skewness:test_data
```

You can configure each of these unique `content_id` identifiers by passing the appropriate `config` and `inputs` in `run_documentation_tests()` or `run_test()`. For example, to configure two separate tests for `Skewness` using different datasets and parameters:

```python
test = vm.tests.run_test(
    test_id="validmind.data_validation.Skewness:training_data",
    params={
        "max_threshold": 1
    },
    dataset=vm_train_ds,
)
test.log()

test = vm.tests.run_test(
    test_id="validmind.data_validation.Skewness:test_data",
    params={
        "max_threshold": 1.5
    },
    dataset=vm_test_ds
)
test.log()
```

<!---[SC 3073] `run_documentation_tests()` should allow specifying inputs for any test individually by @AnilSorathiya in [#327](https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/327)--->
#### Easier specification of inputs for individual tests with `run_documentation_tests()`

The `run_documentation_tests()` function has been updated to allow passing both test `inputs` and `params` via the `config` parameter.

Previously, `config` could already pass `params` to each test that you declare. In this example, the test `SomeTest` receives a custom value for the param `min_threshold`:

```python
full_suite = vm.run_documentation_tests(
    inputs = {
        ...
    },
    config={
        "validmind.data_validation.SomeTest": {
            "min_threshold": 1
        }
    }
)
```

With the updated function, `config` can now pass both `params` and `inputs` to each declared test. For example, to specify what model should be passed to each individual test instance:

```python
full_suite = vm.run_documentation_tests(
    inputs = {
        "dataset": vm_dataset,
        "model": xgb_model
    },
    config = {
        "validmind..model_validation.Accuracy:xgb_model": {
            "params": { threshold: 0.5 },
            "inputs": { "model": xgb_model }
        },
        "validmind..model_validation.Accuracy:lr_model": {
            "params": { threshold: 0.3 },
            "inputs": { "model": lr_model }
        },
    }
)
```

Here, the top-level `inputs` parameter acts as a global `inputs` parameter, and the individual tests can customize what they see as the input model via their own `config` parameters.

<!---[SC-2330] Ability to see available task types and tags by @juanmleng in [#317](https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/317)--->
#### View available task types and tags to filter tests

To enable model developers to know what task types and tags are available to filter on, we have made some updates to our developer framework:

- New `list_task_types()` and `list_tags()` endpoints enable you to list all available `task_type` and `tags` across all test classes
- New `list_tasks_and_tags()` endpoint enables you to list which `tags` are associated to which `task_type`

<!---John6797/sc 2943/developer framework should register documentation by @johnwalz97 in [#324](https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/324)--->
#### Developer framework documentation inputs tracking

We have added a new feature that tracks which datasets and models are used when running tests. Now, when you initialize datasets or models with `vm.init_dataset()` and `vm.init_model()`, we link those inputs with the test results they generate. This makes it clear which inputs were used for each result, improving transparency and making it easier to understand test outcomes. This update does not require any changes to your code and works with existing `init` methods.

### ValidMind Platform UI (v1.13.13)

<!---Update events to show users who ran the developer framework actions by @cachafla in [#532](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/532)--->
#### Updated events to show who ran the developer framework actions

We are now showing the name of the user who ran the action instead of a generic "Developer Framework" name whenever you generate documentation:

::: {.grid}
::: {.g-col-6}
**Before**

<!---Invalid content blocks create errors in run documentation by @cachafla in [#326](https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/326)--->
Invalid content blocks create errors for `run_documentation_tests()`
