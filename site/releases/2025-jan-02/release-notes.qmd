### # Adding Custom Field Permission Check in Your Application

When developing applications, ensuring that users have the appropriate permissions to access and modify custom fields is crucial. This guide outlines the steps necessary to implement a robust custom field permission check in your application.

## Steps for Implementing Custom Field Permission Checks

### 1. Define Permission Levels
Start by defining various permission levels for your custom fields, such as:
- **Read**: Allows users to view the field.
- **Write**: Permits users to modify the field.
- **Admin**: Grants full control, including setting permissions for other users.

### 2. Assign Permissions
Next, assign these permissions on a per-user or per-role basis. You should consider:
- Creating permission groups aligned with user roles (e.g., Admin, Editor, Viewer).
- Storing user-specific permission data in your database.

### 3. Integrate Permission Checks
Incorporate permission checks into your application logic:
- Before displaying a page or a section of it, verify if the user has the correct read permissions.
- Validate write permissions before processing updates on your server-side logic.

### 4. Use Middleware or Interceptors
Implement middleware (in Node.js) or interceptors (in Java/Spring Boot) in the request lifecycle to centralize permission checks:
- This prevents repeated code across different components.
- It ensures consistent checking behavior across all endpoints or services that handle these fields.

Example in Node.js:
```javascript
function checkPermissions(requiredPermission) {
    return function(req, res, next) {
        const userPermissions = req.user.permissions;
        if (userPermissions.includes(requiredPermission)) {
            next();
        } else {
            res.status(403).send('Access Denied');
        }
    };
}

// Usage
app.put('/updateField', checkPermissions('write'), updateFieldHandler);
```

### 5. Provide User Feedback
Ensure that your UI provides clear feedback when a user does not have sufficient privileges to view or edit certain fields:
- Display lock icons or other visual indicators if a field is read-only.
- Show error messages with details about missing permissions attempts.

### 6. Regularly Audit Security Settings
Conduct regular security audits and reviews of your permission settings:
- Ensure that no overly permissive settings could compromise sensitive data.
- Adjust based on changes in role responsibilities and organizational policies.

By following this framework for adding custom field permission checks, you can ensure secure and efficient management of access rights within your applications while safeguarding critical business information from unauthorized access

Administrators can now assign write permissions to individual fields in the model inventory.
 
Generated PR summary: 
 
### Release Notes

This update brings significant enhancements to the management of custom field permissions:

- **Permission Handling Simplification**:
  - Replaced `TPermissionAction` with a generic `string[]` type across various components for streamlined permission handling.

- **Custom Field Modal Enhancements**:
  - New states and logic enable users to change roles associated with specific custom field permissions.
  - Introduced the `useCustomFieldPermissions` hook for efficient fetching and managing of role permissions related to custom fields.
  - Asynchronous updates in role permissions are now supported, with user feedback provided through toast notifications.

- **UI Improvements**:
  - Improved multi-select experience in the `CustomFieldModal` using `chakra-react-select`.
  - Ensured more effective modal state management on the `CustomFields` page for editing or adding fields.

- **Context and Hook Updates**:
  - Updated contexts to incorporate new permission types.
  - Added utility function `isReadOnlyField` in `InventoryModelOverview` to check field editability based on assigned permissions.

These upgrades enhance the flexibility and usability of role-based permission management for custom fields within the application.

PR #198: Add parameter grid support in the comparison tests functionality
URL: https://github.com/validmind/validmind-library/pull/198
Labels: documentation, enhancement
--->
### To incorporate parameter grid support into the comparison tests functionality, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Define Parameter Grid**: Create a dictionary specifying the parameters and their possible values you want to include in the grid. For example:
   ```python
   param_grid = {
       'parameter_1': [value_1, value_2, value_3],
       'parameter_2': [option_1, option_2]
   }
   ```

2. **Use Grid Search**: Implement a mechanism to iterate over all combinations of parameter values as defined in your parameter grid. This can be achieved through a nested loop or by using tools such as `itertools.product`.

3. **Integration with Comparison Tests**: Modify the comparison tests function to accept parameters dynamically and run tests for each set of parameters in the grid.

4. **Collect and Compare Results**: For each parameter combination, execute the test and store results for analysis. You might consider outputting detailed reports for benchmarking performance across different configurations.

Here's some conceptual Python code illustrating these steps:

```python
from itertools import product

def comparison_tests(parameter_set):
    # Functionality that performs the tests with given parameters
    pass

param_grid = {
    'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.05, 0.1],
    'max_depth': [5, 10]
}

# Iterating through all combinations of our parameter grid
for params in product(*param_grid.values()):
    params_dict = dict(zip(param_grid.keys(), params))
    result = comparison_tests(params_dict)
    
    # Store or process result based on your needs
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to get started with integrating a parameter grid into your testing framework efficiently

We currently support comparison tests using the `input_grid` parameter within the `run_test` functionality. However, a similar feature is required for parameters to enhance usability across cases where running the same test against various combinations of test parameters and creating a singular documentation block that compares individual results would be beneficial.

The updated `run_test()` function now accepts a `param_grid`, which facilitates running a test for all possible combinations of specified parameters.

For example, consider the following parameter grid:

```python
param_grid = {
    "param1": [1],
    "param2": [0.1, 0.2],
}
```

In this scenario, a test will be executed once for each of the subsequent parameter groups:

```python
{
    "param1": 1,
    "param2": 0.1
}

{
    "param1": 1,
    "param2": 0.2
}
```

PR #488: Rework training section & update validator training
URL: https://github.com/validmind/documentation/pull/488
Labels: documentation
--->
### ### Training

To ensure our model performs at a high level, we have restructured our training approach to enhance efficiency and outcomes. The updated training plan is divided into three distinct phases:

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**
    - Collect diverse data samples pertinent to the target domain.
    - Preprocess the data by cleaning, normalizing, and augmenting it, which helps in reducing biases and improving model generalization.

2. **Model Architecture Optimization**
    - Evaluate various model architectures to identify the most effective configurations for our tasks.
    - Use hyperparameter tuning techniques such as grid search or Bayesian optimization to fine-tune parameters for optimal performance.

3. **Training Process**
    - Implement a multi-stage training process where simpler models are trained first followed by more complex ones. This incremental complexity allows the model to build foundational knowledge before tackling more intricate tasks.
    - Apply early stopping techniques to prevent overfitting by monitoring validation loss declines without substantial improvement over several epochs.

### Validator Training

The validator module plays a crucial role in ensuring the robustness of model predictions by verifying outputs before final deployment. Its training has been updated as follows:

- **Incorporate Adversarial Examples**: Train validators with adversarial examples to strengthen their ability to detect anomalies and unreliable predictions.
  
- **Cross-validation Techniques**: Adopt k-fold cross-validation during validator training to enhance its reliability across different subsets of data, mitigating potential overfitting.

- **Continuous Learning Integration**: Establish a pipeline for continuous learning where validators receive updates from live data inputs, adapting dynamically to new patterns and variances encountered post-deployment.

These enhancements aim at achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and reliability in real-world applications while maintaining efficiency throughout both the training process and validation stages

We have launched a new training homepage designed to simplify the process of finding and registering for our courses. Additionally, we have enhanced our validator training and user guide by providing more comprehensive guidance for tracking and resolving issues identified in model findings. You can access the new training page through this [link](https://docs.validmind.ai/training/training.html).
