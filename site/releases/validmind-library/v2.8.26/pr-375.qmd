This update enhances the `log_metric` and `alog_metric` functions in the ValidMind Library by adding visual status indicators for monitoring metrics. You can now use the `passed` parameter in the `log_metric()` function to include status badges in Metrics Over Time blocks. The `passed` parameter accepts a boolean value: `passed=True` shows a green "Satisfactory" badge, while `passed=False` shows a yellow "Requires Attention" badge.

This feature lets you visually assess metric performance against defined business rules. You can set the status manually or determine it programmatically using custom evaluation functions with specific acceptance criteria. The status indicators help quickly identify metrics that need attention, support compliance documentation with clear visual cues, and enable more targeted alerts based on metric status.
