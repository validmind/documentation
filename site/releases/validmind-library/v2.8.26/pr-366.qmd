This update enhances the `run_task` function in the `validmind/experimental/agents.py` file to support a new task type. You can now generate qualitative text for a specific section of a document using the `vm.experimental.agents.run_task` method. The generated content will be displayed in the `model_overview` text block section.

The main content is a paragraph discussing the Demo Customer Churn Model, its objectives, and how it integrates with financial institutions to predict customer behavior. The text emphasizes the models use of machine learning techniques and the importance of data validation and quality checks. The layout features a clean, white background with black text, and the section is organized in a single-column format."}
