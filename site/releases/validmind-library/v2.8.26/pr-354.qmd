This update enhances the Jupyter notebook `add_context_to_llm_descriptions.ipynb` by introducing a new section. This section guides you on embedding explicit instructions within a test's docstring to influence LLM-generated test result descriptions. Titled **Add test-specific context using the docstring**, it addresses the issue where non-instructional context in docstrings was previously ignored by the LLM. You are now advised to format specific lines as instructions using syntax like: *INSTRUCTION: Please add the following note at the end of the description: "NOTE: This is a sample of the data, for the full data results please look in the appendix."* This ensures your intended context is reliably included in the LLM-generated descriptions.
