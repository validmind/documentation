We've improved our Jupyter notebooks to make the model documentation quickstart guide more user-friendly and informative for beginners. A new "quickstart" directory has been added to `notebooks/`, along with an updated README to guide you:

To get started with documenting models using the ValidMind Library, check out our updated **Quickstart for model documentation** notebook:

- Learn the basics of using ValidMind to document models as part of a model development workflow.
- Set up the ValidMind Library in your environment and generate a draft of documentation using ValidMind tests for a binary classification model.

This update removes the old `notebooks/code_samples/quickstart_customer_churn_full_suite.ipynb` file as the new file and directory replace it.

The section is divided into two main parts: Split the dataset and Separate features and targets. Under Split the dataset, three bullet points explain the use of train_df, validation_df, and test_df for training, validation, and testing respectively, with a code snippet showing the command customer_churn.preprocess(raw_df). The Separate features and targets section describes the need to differentiate inputs and correct answers, with code snippets defining x_train, x_val, y_train, and y_val using the customer_churn.target_column variable. The layout uses a clear hierarchy with bold section titles and code snippets in a monospaced font." />

The text explains the process of setting up early stopping to prevent overfitting and evaluating model performance using three metrics: error, logloss, and auc. Below the text, a code snippet demonstrates setting early stopping rounds to 10. Another code block shows setting evaluation metrics with model.set_params and a list of metrics. The final code snippet illustrates fitting the model using model.fit with parameters x_train, y_train, x_val, and y_val, and setting verbose to False. The layout is structured with explanatory text followed by corresponding code examples." />
