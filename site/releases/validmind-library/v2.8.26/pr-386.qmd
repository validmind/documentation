This update enhances your experience by allowing you to use your own `LLM`. All existing tests that use an `LLM` now support a user-defined `LLM` or `Embedding` model, provided it is compatible with the `Langchain Chat/Embedding` framework. This functionality is available for `RAGAS` and prompt validation tests, offering greater customization and flexibility in your AI and prompt validation processes.
