### Generate with ValidMind AI

Our new **Generate with AI** button is now available when you edit text blocks in model documentation, model validation reports, and ongoing monitoring plans. This button replaces the old button that was used to AI-generate content.

Clicking on **Generate Text with AI** pops up a modal showing the AI content generation:

Here, you can choose to **Accept Text** or **Try Again**:
