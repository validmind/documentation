### Generate with ValidMind AI



:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-50-ns}
Our new **Generate with AI** button is now available when you edit simple text blocks in model documentation, model validation reports, and ongoing monitoring plans. 

- This button replaces the old button that was used to AI-generate content.
- Enter a prompt, which will present you with a draft for review. You can choose to **Accept Text** to insert the draft into your text block, or **Try Again**.

<form method="get" action="/guide/model-documentation/work-with-content-blocks.html" target="_blank">
   <button type="submit" style="color: white; background-color: #de257e; border-radius: 8px; border: none; font-size: 16px; padding: 6.25px 12.5px; margin-left: 16px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Work with content blocks</button>
</form>
