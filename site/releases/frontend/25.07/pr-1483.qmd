You can now view OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication details directly on the `admin/users` page. By clicking on a user's details, you can see which OIDC provider they used to log in and the time of their login.

<!--- DEBUG INFORMATION
INITIAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
ASSESSMENT:
The main issues in the content include duplication between the PR summary and external notes, and the presence of technical jargon that could be simplified for clarity. There are no Markdown headings that need conversion, and no internal content related to CI/CD workflows is present. The images are correctly formatted and should be preserved.

PASS_1_INSTRUCTIONS:
- Remove the PR summary as it is redundant with the external notes. The external notes provide a more comprehensive and user-focused description of the update.
- Ensure that the external notes start with a clear user benefit statement, as they already do, and maintain the current structure.

PASS_2_INSTRUCTIONS:
- Since the PR summary and external notes overlap, consolidate by removing the PR summary entirely. The external notes should be prioritized and preserved as they provide more context.
- Ensure that the external notes clearly describe the update without needing additional introductory content.

PASS_3_INSTRUCTIONS:
- Simplify any technical jargon in the external notes for clarity. For example, ensure terms like "OIDC" are clearly explained or contextualized if necessary.
- Ensure all sentences in the external notes end with periods for proper punctuation.
- Maintain the flow and readability of the external notes without adding new content or altering the existing structure.
