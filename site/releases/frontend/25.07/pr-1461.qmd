<!--- DEBUG INFORMATION
INITIAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
ASSESSMENT:
The main issues in the content include a lack of clear structure and potential duplication between the PR summary and external notes. The PR summary introduces a feature that is then elaborated upon in the external notes. Additionally, there are Markdown headings that need conversion to bold text, and references to CI/CD workflows, which should be removed. The content should start with text, not images.

PASS_1_INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Remove any references to CI/CD workflows, GitHub Actions, build processes, deployment pipelines, or internal automation.
2. Ensure the content begins with text rather than images. Move the introductory text from the external notes to the beginning of the document.
3. Convert the Markdown heading "**Enhancement**" to bold text format.
4. Ensure all sentences end with periods.

PASS_2_INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Consolidate the PR summary and the external notes introduction. The external notes should be prioritized, so integrate the PR summary's mention of the "new broadcast messaging feature" into the external notes introduction, if not already covered.
2. Remove the PR summary after integrating its content into the external notes to avoid redundancy.

PASS_3_INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Simplify any verbose language and ensure clarity in the explanation of features.
2. Break up any overly long sentences for better readability.
3. Ensure the flow of the document is logical and coherent, focusing on the user benefits of the new broadcast feature.
4. Double-check that all sentences are clear and concise, using direct language addressed to 'you'.

FINAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
DETAILED ASSESSMENT:
STATUS: RETURN_TO_PASS_2  
ISSUE: Duplicate introductions are present. Both the introductory sentence and the enhancement section start with similar information about the new broadcast messaging feature.  
RECOMMENDATION: Consolidate the introductory sentences to eliminate redundancy and create a single, clear introduction to the enhancement.

Loop 1: RETURN_TO_PASS_2
Issue: Duplicate introductions are present. Both the introductory sentence and the enhancement section start with similar information about the new broadcast messaging feature.
Recommendation: Consolidate the introductory sentences to eliminate redundancy and create a single, clear introduction to the enhancement.

Loop 2: RETURN_TO_PASS_2
Issue: Duplicate introductions are present. Both the introductory sentence and the enhancement section start with similar information about the new broadcast messaging feature.
Recommendation: Remove or consolidate the duplicate introductory content to streamline the information and avoid redundancy.

Loop 3: RETURN_TO_PASS_2
