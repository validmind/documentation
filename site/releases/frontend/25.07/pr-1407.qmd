This update allows you to customize finding statuses within the application. You can now create new finding statuses and 'soft-delete' existing ones. If a finding status is deleted, all findings currently using that status will default to `Open`.

<!--- DEBUG INFORMATION
INITIAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
ASSESSMENT:
The main issues in the content include a lack of clear structure and some duplication between the PR summary and external notes. The external notes provide more detailed information, which should be prioritized. There are no Markdown headings to convert, and the content is generally clear and concise. There are no references to CI/CD workflows or internal processes, and the image is properly included.

PASS_1_INSTRUCTIONS:
- Remove the PR summary as its content is redundant with the more detailed external notes. The external notes already cover the introduction of the new feature for managing finding statuses.
- Ensure the content starts with the external notes, preserving the image link and all its attributes.

PASS_2_INSTRUCTIONS:
- No changes needed. The PR summary will be removed in Pass 1, so no further deduplication is required.

PASS_3_INSTRUCTIONS:
- No changes needed. The content is already clear and concise, with no verbose language or complex lists. There are no Markdown headings to convert, and all sentences are properly punctuated.
