You can now upload sourcemaps to Datadog and Sentry, improving error tracking and debugging in production. This update helps you monitor and resolve issues more efficiently by using a new multi-stage Docker build. This method creates smaller, more efficient Docker images by separating the build and runtime environments, simplifying dependency management and optimizing sourcemap uploads.
