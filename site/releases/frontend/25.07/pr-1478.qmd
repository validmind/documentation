The `pbkdf2` library has been updated from version 3.1.2 to 3.1.3. This update includes the following changes:

- Fixed an issue where unknown algorithms now correctly produce errors, and known algorithms align with Node.js behavior.
- Updated dependencies: `create-hmac`, `safe-buffer`, and `sha.js`.
- Pinned `create-hash` and `ripemd160` to prevent breaking changes.
