This update upgrades `pbkdf2` from version 3.1.2 to 3.1.3.

**Changelog**

- Fixed an issue where unknown algorithms now correctly throw errors, and known algorithms align with Node.js behavior.
- Updated dependencies: `create-hmac`, `safe-buffer`, and `sha.js`.
- Pinned `create-hash` and `ripemd160` due to breaking changes.

<!--- DEBUG INFORMATION
INITIAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
ASSESSMENT:
The main issues identified in the content include the presence of Markdown headings that need conversion to bold text, potential duplication between the PR summary and external notes, and internal content that should be removed. Additionally, there is a need to ensure clarity and streamline verbose language.

PASS_1_INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Remove Internal Content**: Eliminate any references to CI/CD workflows, GitHub Actions, build processes, deployment pipelines, or internal automation. In this case, there are no such references, so no changes are needed.
2. **Convert Markdown Headings**: Change the Markdown headings in the changelog section to bold text. For example, convert `##` to `**` for the version number and `###` to `**` for the "Commits" section.
3. **Ensure Completeness**: Verify that all sentences are complete and end with periods. Ensure that the content starts with text and not images.

PASS_2_INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Deduplicate Content**: Since the PR Summary is "None," there is no introductory paragraph to overlap with the external notes. Therefore, no deduplication is needed in this case.

PASS_3_INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Streamline Language**: Simplify any verbose language and ensure clarity. For example, rephrase complex sentences for better readability without altering the technical meaning.
2. **Improve Flow**: Ensure that the content flows logically and cohesively from one section to the next. Adjust sentence structure as needed to enhance readability.
3. **Formatting Consistency**: Ensure all sentences are properly punctuated and that any technical terms are enclosed in backticks as needed.
