When you are added to an organization, you now receive a Basic User role, identified by the `is_basic_role` property. This role comes with preset permissions that you can modify later if needed.

<!--- DEBUG INFORMATION
INITIAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
ASSESSMENT:
The main issues in the content include overlap between the PR summary and external notes, which needs consolidation. There are no Markdown headings to convert, and no internal content references to remove. The language is clear, but the structure could be improved by merging the overlapping information.

PASS_1_INSTRUCTIONS:
- No changes needed for content structure as there are no Markdown headings or internal content references.
- Ensure that the content starts with the most relevant user-focused information from the external notes.

PASS_2_INSTRUCTIONS:
- Consolidate the PR summary and external notes into a single, coherent statement. The PR summary introduces the enhancement, while the external notes provide user-focused details. Merge these by starting with the user-focused information: "When you are added to an organization, you now receive a Basic User role (list of roles marked as `is_basic_role`) with preset permissions that can be modified later."
- Remove the redundant introductory sentence from the PR summary: "This update introduces an enhancement to the role management feature by adding a new property, `is_basic_role`, to the role model."

PASS_3_INSTRUCTIONS:
- No changes needed for clarity and style as the language is already clear and direct.
- Ensure all sentences have proper punctuation and flow smoothly.
- Verify that there are no formatting issues, and that the content is concise and focused on user benefits.
