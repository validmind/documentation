<!-- Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first line. 
    In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it isn't indented. -->
