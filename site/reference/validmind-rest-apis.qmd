https://api.validmind.com/vm/api/v1
```

This version of the API is **v1**, specified in the path (`/vm/api/v1`). Future breaking changes will be introduced under a new version path.

### Key capabilities

- **Model inventory management**  
  Retrieve, filter, create, and update models.  
  Supports querying by tiering, owners, validators, status, and more.  
  Supports exporting model data as JSON or CSV.

- **Group and access control**  
  List, create, and manage access groups.  
  Add or remove users and resources to/from groups.

  Basic endpoints to validate authentication (`/test-auth`) and check service status (`/health`).
