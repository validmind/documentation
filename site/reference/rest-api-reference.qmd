## ValidMind API Overview

The ValidMind Public API allows clients to programmatically interact with models, templates, groups, business units, and other organizational resources. It follows REST principles and uses JSON for both requests and responses.

### Base URL

```
https://api.validmind.com/vm/api/v1
```

### Versioning

This version of the API is **v1**, specified in the path (`/vm/api/v1`). Future breaking changes will be introduced under a new version path.

### Key capabilities

- **Model inventory management**  
  Retrieve, filter, create, and update models.  
  Supports querying by tiering, owners, validators, status, and more.  
  Supports exporting model data as JSON or CSV.

- **Group and access control**  
  List, create, and manage access groups.  
  Add or remove users and resources to/from groups.  
  Filter by default groups and apply sorting.

- **Business unit management**  
  Retrieve and manage business units associated with the organization.  
  Supports filtering, search, and pagination.

- **Template access**  
  Retrieve available templates used for model documentation and validation.  
  Includes support for fetching template metadata and default structures.

- **Use case management**  
  Create and organize use cases and use case categories.  
  Supports sorting, filtering, and hierarchical structures.

- **Field masking for optimized responses**  
  Use the `X-Fields` header to control which fields are returned in API responses.  
  Useful for minimizing payload size and tailoring data for frontend consumption.

- **Health and authentication checks**  
  Basic endpoints to validate authentication (`/test-auth`) and check service status (`/health`).

## ValidMind Admin API Overview

The ValidMind Admin API provides endpoints to manage organizations, users, roles, templates, and system bootstrap. It is intended for internal or privileged use and requires a valid **admin API key** for all operations.

### Base URL

```
https://api.validmind.com/admin/api/v1
```

### Versioning

This version of the API is **v1**, specified in the path (`/admin/api/v1`). Future breaking changes will be introduced under a new version path.


### Key capabilities

- **Organization management**
  - Create, update, and retrieve organizations
  - Bootstrap an initial organization with default configuration
  - Fetch or upload default templates and configuration data

- **User management**
  - Create and update users and admin users
  - Assign roles and organizations
  - Regenerate user API credentials

- **System bootstrap**
  - One-time initialization of a base organization, admin user, and default data

## Authentication

All endpoints require API key authentication. Include the key in the `Authorization` header:

```
-H x-api-key <api-key>
-H x-api-secret <api-secret>
```

Some endpoints also support the `X-Fields` header to return a partial response based on a field mask.

## Rate Limiting

All authenticated requests are subject to rate limits. If a rate limit is exceeded, the API responds with a `429 Too Many Requests` error.

## Common Response Codes

| Code | Meaning                      |
|------|------------------------------|
| 200  | Success                      |
| 400  | Bad request (validation)     |
| 401  | Authentication failed        |
| 403  | Authorization failed         |
| 404  | Resource not found           |
| 500  | Internal server error        |

## Data Formats

- All endpoints consume and produce `application/json`
- CSV format is optionally supported for some listing endpoints using the `format=csv` query parameter
