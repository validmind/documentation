Time Series Test Suites









  
### Class: TimeSeriesDataQuality

Test suite for data quality on time series datasets





**Bases:** TestSuite

#### Methods

   
### Class: TimeSeriesDataset

Test suite for time series datasets.





**Bases:** TestSuite

#### Methods

   
### Class: TimeSeriesModelValidation

Test suite for time series model validation.





**Bases:** TestSuite

#### Methods

   
### Class: TimeSeriesMultivariate

This test suite provides a preliminary understanding of the features
and relationship in multivariate dataset. It presents various
multivariate visualizations that can help identify patterns, trends,
and relationships between pairs of variables. The visualizations are
designed to explore the relationships between multiple features
simultaneously. They allow you to quickly identify any patterns or
trends in the data, as well as any potential outliers or anomalies.
The individual feature distribution can also be explored to provide
insight into the range and frequency of values observed in the data.
This multivariate analysis test suite aims to provide an overview of
the data structure and guide further exploration and modeling.

#### Methods

   
### Class: TimeSeriesUnivariate

This test suite provides a preliminary understanding of the target variable(s)
used in the time series dataset. It visualizations that present the raw time
series data and a histogram of the target variable(s).

The raw time series data provides a visual inspection of the target variable's
behavior over time. This helps to identify any patterns or trends in the data,
as well as any potential outliers or anomalies. The histogram of the target
variable displays the distribution of values, providing insight into the range
and frequency of values observed in the data.
