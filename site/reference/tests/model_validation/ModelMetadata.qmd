## get_model_info[()]{.muted}

```python
def get_model_info(
    model):
```

Attempts to extract all model info from a model object instance

## ModelMetadata[()]{.muted}

```python
def ModelMetadata(
    model):
```

Compare metadata of different models and generate a summary table with the results. **Purpose**: The purpose of this function is to compare the metadata of different models, including information about their architecture, framework, framework version, and programming language.

**Test Mechanism**: The function retrieves the metadata for each model using `get_model_info`, renames columns according to a predefined set of labels, and compiles this information into a summary table.

**Signs of High Risk**:

- Inconsistent or missing metadata across models can indicate potential issues in model documentation or management.
- Significant differences in framework versions or programming languages might pose challenges in model integration and deployment.

**Strengths**:

- Provides a clear comparison of essential model metadata.
- Standardizes metadata labels for easier interpretation and comparison.
- Helps identify potential compatibility or consistency issues across models.

**Limitations**:

- Assumes that the `get_model_info` function returns all necessary metadata fields.
- Relies on the correctness and completeness of the metadata provided by each model.
- Does not include detailed parameter information, focusing instead on high-level metadata.
