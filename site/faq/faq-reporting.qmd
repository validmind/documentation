## What analytic features are offered by {{< var vm.product >}}?

- Out-of-the-box reports within the {{< var validmind.platform >}}[^1] are broken down by data on models and data on artifacts.
- For each of the bar charts, you can hover for numerical breakdowns or click on individual bars to get a more detailed view.[^2]
- You're also able to add custom report pages and analytic widgets to supplement the out-of-the-box reports provided.[^3] 

By default, the [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} role[^4] has sufficient permissions to manage custom reporting.
