## Which languages, libraries, and environments do you support?

- The {{< var validmind.developer >}}[^1] is designed to be platform-agnostic and compatible with most popular open-source programming languages and model development environments in Python and R,[^2] from XGBoost to more sophisticated libraries such as Pytorch and TensorFlow — and many more.
- We directly support Matplotlib[^3] and Plotly[^4] plotting libraries for visual representations, and you're able to return images from other libraries as bytes-like objects.[^5]

::: {.callout}
## Currently, we support **Python {{< var version.python >}}** and the most popular AI/ML and data science libraries.

Support for commercial and closed-source programming languages such as SAS and Matlab depends on specific deployment details and commercial agreements with customers.

## What test ingestion or modeling techniques are supported?

- {{< var vm.product >}} supports ingesting test results from your training and evaluation pipeline, such as using batch prediction or online prediction mechanisms.[^6]
- We are also offer standard documentation via the {{< var vm.developer >}} for additional modeling techniques.[^7] 

{{< include _faq-images.qmd >}}

## What large language model (LLM) features are offered?

{{< var vm.product >}} offers several specialized features that use large language models (LLMs) to streamline model risk management and ensure regulatory compliance:
 
- **Test interpretation** — Interprets results from tests run within {{< var vm.product >}}.
- **Qualitative checks** — Leverages metadata from the model inventory, test outcomes, and additional data provided to create qualitative sections within model documentation.
- **Risk assessment** — Using data from test results, generates a tailored risk assessment for each section of model documentation.
- **Document checker** — Reviews model development documentation to ensure it aligns with relevant regulatory requirements.

## What deployment options are supported by {{< var vm.product >}}?

{{< include /about/deployment/_deployment-available-options.qmd >}}

<!-- BELOW REMOVED AFTER ANDRES CONFIRMED WE DON'T SUPPORT DATA DICTIONARIES IN A WAY OUR USERS WOULD EXPECT - BC (Nov 27, 2024) -->

<!-- ## Does {{< var vm.product >}} support data dictionaries?

Yes, you can pass data dictionaries to {{< var vm.product >}} via the {{< var vm.developer >}}, such as in CSV format. -->

<!-- BELOW REMOVED ON REQUEST AS PER SC-6528 -->

<!-- ## Can you integrate with JIRA to connect with our Model Development pipeline?

{{< var vm.product >}} is planning to provide integration with JIRA tickets via the JIRA Python API. You will be able to configure {{< var vm.product >}} to update the status of a particular JIRA ticket when a specific state or approval is triggered from the workflow (roadmap item – Q3’2023). -->

<!-- ## Do you support integration with data lakes and ETL solutions?

Support for connecting to data lakes and data processing or ETL pipelines is on our roadmap (Q3’2023+).

We will be implementing connector interfaces allowing extraction of relationships between raw data sources and final post-processed datasets for preloaded session instances received from Spark and Snowflake. -->
