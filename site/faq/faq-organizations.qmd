## How do I get access to {{< var vm.product >}}?

#### 1. Register with ValidMind

Register with our cloud-hosted {{< var validmind.platform >}},[^1] which enables you to work with model documentation or configure ValidMind for your organization.

With an email address or a Google, GitHub, or Microsoft account, you can gain access to ValidMind either by signing up independently, or accepting an invite from another member of your organization.

#### 2. Log in to ValidMind


## How do access permissions to the {{< var validmind.platform >}} work? 

Access to the {{< var validmind.platform >}} where your model inventory is hosted is associated with an organization, which encompasses all your users, groups, and business units. 

 - Users belong to groups which determine which models they can see, and have roles with attached permissions which define the level of access they have to features.
 - Groups are segments of users with the ability to view models associated with that group. Access to granular features in the {{< var vm.platform >}} within a group’s set of models is further defined by roles and permissions.
 - Roles are a named set of permissions that determine your users’ access to features within the {{< var vm.platform >}} based on your organization’s structure. 
 - Permissions dictate user access controls within the {{< var vm.platform >}}, and are associated with specific roles.

By default, the [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} role[^1] has sufficient permissions to manage access permissions for users, groups, and roles.
