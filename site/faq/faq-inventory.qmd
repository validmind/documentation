## Can permissions for the model inventory be configured?

ValidMind allows you to configure view and edit permissions for the model inventory and documentation or validation reports based on user roles.

## Is it possible to track or view a summary of questions asked by validators?

Questions, comments, and findings from model validations are centrally tracked and accessible within the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.

## Can the model inventory track revalidation, periodic validation dates, and more?

In addition to initial validation exercises, ValidMind can manage activities throughout the entire model risk management lifecycle, including periodic reviews, change validations, and ongoing monitoring deadlines (roadmap item â€“ Q3 2023).

## Do you support executive reporting for senior leaders in our BUs?

ValidMind is working on a dashboard feature that provides executive metrics, such as model documentation compliance reporting across BUs, findings by status and model use case, and more.

These metrics can be exported into a customizable report for the customer.
