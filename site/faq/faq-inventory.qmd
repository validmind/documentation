## Can the {{< var vm.product >}} model inventory be customized?

The information that is displayed on the model inventory is configurable on a per user basis. You can also search, filter, and sort models to narrow down results.  

 - Fields that appear on all models for all users can also be customized.[^1]
 - By default, the [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} role[^2] has sufficient permissions to manage model inventory fields.

## Can I archive or delete models within {{< var vm.product >}}?

Yes, models can be archived within the {{< var validmind.platform >}} model inventory to keep your inventory accurate and up to date with your organization’s current resources.[^3]
 
- Once models are archived, they can then be deleted if desired. 
- By default, the [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} role has sufficient permissions to archive and delete models.

## Can I track model interdependencies within the model inventory?

Yes, the {{< var validmind.platform >}} allows you to connect two or more models together in your model inventory.[^4] 

- You can note both upstream and downstream models.
- By default, the [{{< fa code >}} Developer]{.bubble} role has sufficient permissions to edit model interdependencies.

## How do I track activity on models, documentation, validation reports, etc.?

The {{< var validmind.platform >}} provides an audit trail functionality, enabling you to track or audit all the information events associated with a specific model. 

You can review a full record of comments, workflow status changes, and any other updates made to the model.

<!-- ## Can the model inventory track revalidation, periodic validation dates, and more?
