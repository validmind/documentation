## How does {{< var vm.product >}} manage updates to models?

1. {{< var vm.product >}} allows model developers to re-run documentation functions with the {{< var validmind.developer >}}^[[{{< var validmind.developer >}}](/developer/validmind-library.qmd)] to capture changes in the model, such as changes in the number of features or hyperparameters. 
2. After a model developer has made a change in their development environment, such as to a Jupyter Notebook,^[[Code samples](/developer/samples-jupyter-notebooks.qmd)] they can execute the relevant {{< var vm.product >}} documentation function to update the corresponding documentation section. 
3. {{< var vm.product >}} will then automatically recreate the relevant figures and tables and update them in the online documentation.
