## How do I register models with {{< var vm.product >}}?

Register models within the {{< var validmind.platform >}} via the model inventory as the first step towards streamlining your model documentation and validation workflow.

To add a model to the inventory, you fill out a customizable questionnaire capturing the required registration metadata.

## Are model registration questionnaires customizable?

Along with default fields provided by {{< var vm.product >}} as part of your basic model information,[^1] you can add additional model information and make these custom fields required on registration. 

You can modify these custom fields as needed and on an ongoing basis.

<!-- BELOW REMOVED ON REQUEST AS PER SC-6528 -->

<!-- ## Can we leverage content from historical documentation? 

{{< var vm.product >}} is in the process of developing features that allow you to benefit from content in historical documentation by:

- Allowing users to select definitions and specific documentation artifacts from previous model documentation for particular model use cases
- Offering users AI-generated content suggestions for specific areas of the documentation (e.g., qualitative sections) based on high-quality historical documentation

These features are currently on the roadmap and under research, no release schedule is set yet. -->

<!-- ## Can we customize illustrations?

{{< var vm.product >}} utilizes open-source libraries (such as Seaborn and Matplotlib) to generate plots and illustrations. We are working on implementing the ability for model developers to customize styling parameters for these libraries directly within the {{< var vm.developer >}}.

This feature is currently scheduled for Q4 2023.

Additionally, {{< var vm.product >}} is developing a feature that enables developers to create custom visualization widgets by writing JavaScript-based rendering code. -->

<!-- ## Can {{< var vm.product >}} manage complex model hierarchies or use cases with multiple models?

{{< var vm.product >}} is enhancing support for complex or modular models in two ways:

- By adding parent/sub-model relational attributes to the model inventory. This is a roadmap item currently scheduled for Q2’2023.
- By enabling tests to run on multiple models simultaneously and aggregating the results. This is a roadmap item currently scheduled for Q3’2023. -->
