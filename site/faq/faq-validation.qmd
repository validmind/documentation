## Can I set up custom validation guidelines for use in templates?

Yes, {{< var vm.product >}} supports the implementation of custom validation guidelines from within the {{< var validmind.platform >}}:[^1] 

1. After you set up risk areas for your organization, you can then add guidelines to each risk area.
2. Once guidelines are available, add them to the desired validation report templates. 

By default, the [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} role[^2] has sufficient permissions to manage validation guidelines. 

## How does {{< var vm.product >}} help with assessing model compliance?

Use {{< var vm.product >}} to assess compliance of your models with guidelines based on analyzing evidence and findings,[^3] providing an unbiased starting point that enables more efficient discussions between validators and developers.

Without leaving the {{< var validmind.platform >}}, you're able to:

1. Link logged evidence to validation reports
2. Link tracked findings to validation reports
3. Provide granular compliance assessments for each section of your validation report

By default, the [{{< fa circle-check >}} Validator]{.bubble} role has sufficient permissions to assess model compliance on validation reports.

## What support does {{< var vm.product >}} offer for model findings?

- Within the {{< var validmind.platform >}}, you're able to log findings at the model or the documentation section level.[^4]
- On each finding, you're able to outline proposed remediation plans, attach supporting documentation, track the finding's status, attach the finding to a risk area and/or documentation section, designate a due date, and assign a resolution owner. 
- You can also access a complete list of filterable findings logged across all your models, or look at only findings linked to a specific model.[^5]

By default, the [{{< fa circle-check >}} Validator]{.bubble} role has sufficient permissions to manage model findings.
