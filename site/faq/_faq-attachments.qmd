## Can we attach files to models, findings, or documentation? 

Yes, attachment type inventory fields are available for custom use.^[[Manage model inventory fields](/guide/model-inventory/manage-model-inventory-fields.qmd)] Once created, attachment type fields allow you to upload supporting files to your model.

- Out-of-the-box functionality is included for attaching files to model findings.
- You can also attach images to documentation content blocks and comments. 

By default, the [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} role has sufficient permissions to manage model inventory fields.
