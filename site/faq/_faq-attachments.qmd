## Can we attach files to models, findings, or documentation? 

- Attachment type inventory fields are available for custom use.^[[Manage model inventory fields](/guide/model-inventory/manage-model-inventory-fields.qmd)] Once created, attachment type fields allow you to upload supporting files to your model.
- Out-of-the-box functionality is included for attaching files to model findings.
- You can also attach images to documentation content blocks and comments.
