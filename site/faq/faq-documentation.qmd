## Can I run tests and log documentation without having a model available?

If you do not have a model ready, or your model can't be loaded directly, or you only have access to model predictions, you can still run tests and log documentation with {{< var vm.product >}} as long as you're able to load the model predictions.

- Use [`assign_predictions()`](/validmind/validmind/vm_models.html#VMDataset.assign_predictions){target="_blank"} to load predictions from a separate file or a dataset with predictions.
- Call [`init_model()`](/validmind/validmind.html#init_model){target="_blank"} but instead of a trained model instance, pass an `input_id` and model metadata. [`ModelMetadata()`](/validmind/validmind/tests/model_validation/ModelMetadata.html#ModelMetadata){target="_blank"} will use the provided metadata instead of trying to calculate it from the model's library. 

    For example: 

    ```python
    external_model = vm.init_model(
        input_id="spark_ml_model",
        metadata={...}
    )
    ```

::: {.callout title="If neither a trained model instance nor metadata is provided, `init_model()` will return an error.  "}
However, tests that need a trained model will not work with "empty" models.

## Can documentation templates be configured per model use case or to match our existing templates?

The {{< var validmind.platform >}} allows you to configure multiple templates based on documentation requirements for each model use case. During the model registration process, the {{< var vm.platform >}} automatically selects the template based on the provided model use case information.

Documentation templates can be modified by configuring a YAML file in the backend.

## Can the documentation be exported?

{{< var vm.product >}} supports exporting documentation and validation reports in Word (.docx) or PDF formats.

## Can we attach files to the documentation on the UI? What file formats are supported?

You can attach image files to documentation cells and comments on the UI. The following file formats are supported:

- JPEG
- PNG
- GIF
- TIFF
- BMP
- SVG
- RAW
- WebP
- HEIF
- PSD

Additionally, {{< var vm.product >}} is working on enabling you to attach Excel, CSV, Word, and PDF files to the documentation in the UI (Roadmap item â€“ Q2 2023).

## Can the documentation be initialized from the {{< var validmind.platform >}} instead of the {{< var validmind.developer >}}?

{{< var vm.product >}} allows you to write documentation directly in the {{< var validmind.platform >}}, without having to use the {{< var validmind.developer >}}.

You can edit text and tables and upload your test results using the {{< var vm.platform >}}, including images. Using the {{< var vm.developer >}}, you can execute test suites and generate the corresponding documentation.

## Can we export the documentation produced by {{< var vm.product >}} to the storage/workflow system used by the model validation team?

Documentation and validation reports produced in {{< var vm.product >}} can be exported to Word and PDF formats. Depending on the integration requirements of the systems used by your validation teams, such as connectivity via API, SharePoint, and more, {{< var vm.product >}} can work with you to automate the export and storage of documentation into these systems.
