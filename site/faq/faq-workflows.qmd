### How are parallel editing and version control handled?

{{< var vm.product >}} currently allows multiple users to simultaneously edit documentation in the {{< var validmind.platform >}}. If two users are editing the same cell on the UI, the most recently saved version of the content will prevail. 

{{< var vm.product >}} is implementing more sophisticated version control features:

- {{< var vm.product >}} will provide a detailed version and revision history, and notification system, for you to view what changes have been applied to the documentation (roadmap item for Q2’2023).
- The {{< var vm.platform >}} will provide an indication if another user is currently editing the same cell on the online UI (roadmap item for Q3’2023).
- Administrators will be given the ability to configure content syncing and session management preferences (roadmap item currently scheduled for Q4’2023).

### Can we work with disconnected workflows?

{{< var vm.product >}} supports disconnected workflows natively at the data-collection level since the {{< var validmind.developer >}} creates individual test runs every time a new test iteration is executed. This allows for running parallel/disconnected tests that individually send results to the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.

Visualizing the disconnected workflow in terms of model testing and documentation will depend on requirements at the use-case level.

### Can the workflow accommodate an additional review step, before the documentation gets sent to the 2nd line model validation team?

With {{< var vm.product >}}, administrators can create custom workflows for the review and approval of models throughout their lifecycles.

These workflows can be configured to include any number of review stages before submission, and administrators can configure which stakeholders will be involved at each stage. 

{{< var vm.product >}} is also implementing the ability for administrators to configure default user roles and user groups or teams as part of initial onboarding onto the tool (roadmap item – Q2 2023).


### How flexible is {{< var vm.product >}} to accommodate our own model development and review workflows?

{{< var vm.product >}} allows administrators to create custom workflows for the review and approval of models based on your model risk management processes, once the user decides it is ready for review.

These workflows can be configured to include any number of review stages before submission, and administrators can configure which stakeholders are involved at each stage.

You can also leverage {{< var vm.product >}}’s {{< var vm.developer >}} once you are ready to document a specific model for review and validation. That is, you do not need to use {{< var vm.product >}} while you are in the exploration or R&D phase of model development.
