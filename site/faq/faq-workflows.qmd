## Can I customize workflows within {{< var vm.product >}}?

- Yes, you can create custom workflows for the review and approval of models throughout their lifecycles with {{< var validmind.platform >}},[^1] enabling you to more easily oversee your organization's unique model risk management process. 
- For example, workflows can be configured to include any number of review stages involving different sets of stakeholders â€” at any point in the process.

By default, the [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} role[^2] has sufficient permissions to manage workflows.

## What statuses are available for use in workflows?

- Lifecycle statuses are manipulated via workflow transitions and can also be fully customized within the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.
- Default statuses are provided for you as suggestions. You can add, edit, remove, and define your own custom statuses.

By default, the [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} role has sufficient permissions to manage lifecycle statuses.

## Can we work with disconnected workflows?

Yes, {{< var vm.product >}} supports disconnected workflows natively at the data-collection level since the {{< var validmind.developer >}}[^3] creates individual test runs every time a new test iteration is executed. 

- This allows for running parallel/disconnected tests that individually send results to the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.
- Visualizing the disconnected workflow in terms of model testing and documentation will depend on requirements at the use-case level.

## You can also leverage the {{< var validmind.developer >}} once you are ready to document a specific model for review and validation. 

You do not need to use the {{< var validmind.platform >}} while you are in the exploration or R&D phase of model development.
