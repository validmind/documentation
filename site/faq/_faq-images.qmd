## Do you support including images in model documentation?
<span id="images"></span>
Yes, as long as you can produce the image with Python or open the image from a file, you can include it in your documentation with {{< var vm.product >}}:^[[Implement custom tests](/notebooks/code_samples/custom_tests/implement_custom_tests.ipynb#custom-test-images)]

- If you want to log an image as a test result, you can do so by passing the path to the image as a parameter to the custom test and then opening the file in the test function.
- If you are using a plotting library that isn’t directly supported by {{< var vm.product >}}, you can still return the image directly as a bytes-like object.
