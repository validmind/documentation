## How do the out-of-the-box tests developed by {{< var vm.product >}} work?

All the default tests are developed using open-source Python and R libraries.

The {{< var validmind.developer >}}[^1] test interface is a light wrapper that defines utility functions to agnostically interact with different dataset and model backends, and contains functions to collect and post results to the {{< var validmind.platform >}}[^2] using a generic results schema.

## When do I use tests and tests suites?

While you have the flexibility to decide when to use which {{< var vm.product >}} tests, here are a few typical scenarios:[^3]

- **Dataset testing** — To document and validate your dataset.
- **Model testing** — To document and validate your model.
- **End-to-end testing** — To document a binary classification model and the relevant dataset end-to-end.

## Can we configure, customize, or add our own tests?

Yes, {{< var vm.product >}} allows tests to be manipulated at several levels:

- You can configure which tests are required to run programmatically depending on the model use case.[^4]
- You can change the thresholds and parameters for default tests already available in the {{< var vm.developer >}} — for instance, changing the threshold parameter for the class imbalance flag.[^5]
- You can also connect your own custom tests with the {{< var validmind.developer >}}. These custom tests are configurable and are able to run programmatically, just like the rest of the {{< var vm.developer >}}.[^6]
- Personalize tests further for your use case by using {{< var vm.product >}}'s `RawData` feature[^7] to customize the output of tests.

In addition to custom tests, you can also add use case and test-specific context for any test to enhance the LLM-generated test descriptions using the {{< var validmind.developer >}}.[^8]
:::

## How do I log tests as a developer?

You use the {{< var validmind.developer >}} to run and log tests during model development, the results of which are then inserted your model documentation within the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.[^9] The {{< var vm.developer >}} also automatically generates draft test descriptions for your test results — generations that can be modified for your custom use cases.[^10]

To log tests as a developer with the {{< var validmind.developer >}}:

- You must have the [{{< fa code >}} Developer]{.bubble} role[^11] or another role with sufficient permissions to create and own models, and to work with model documentation.
- You must be the model owner or model developer, but not the model validator,[^12] for the model you want to log tests and update documentation for.

## How do I log tests as a validator?

You use the {{< var validmind.developer >}} to run and log tests during model validation, the results of which are then inserted your validation report within the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.[^13] The {{< var vm.developer >}} also automatically generates draft test descriptions for your test results — generations that can be modified for your custom use cases.[^14]

To log tests as a validator with the {{< var validmind.developer >}}:

- You must have the [{{< fa circle-check >}} Validator]{.bubble} role[^15] or another role with sufficient permissions to access models for validation, to review model documentation, and to work with validation reports and model artifacts.
- You must be the model validator, but not the model owner or model developer,[^16] for the model you want to log tests and update documentation for.
