The {{< var validmind.developer >}} helps you streamline model documentation by automating the generation of drafts. All you need to do is upload your documentation artifacts and test results to the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.

## What is the {{< var validmind.developer >}}?

The {{< var validmind.developer >}} provides a rich collection of documentation tools and test suites, from documenting descriptions of your dataset to validation testing your models for weak spots and overfit areas.

![The two main components of {{< var vm.product >}}: the {{< var validmind.developer >}} that integrates with your existing developer environment, and the {{< var validmind.platform >}}](/get-started/validmind-lifecycle.jpg){width=70% fig-alt="An image showing the two main components of ValidMind: the ValidMind Library that integrates with your existing developer environment, and the ValidMind Platform"}

{{< var vm.product >}} offers two primary methods for automating model documentation:

- **Generate documentation** — Through automation, the {{< var vm.developer >}} extracts metadata from associated datasets and models for you and generates model documentation based on a template. You can also add more documentation and tests manually using the documentation editing capabilities in the {{< var validmind.platform >}}. 

- **Run validation tests** — The {{< var vm.developer >}} provides a suite of validation tests for common financial services use cases. For cases where these tests do not cover everything you need, you can also extend existing test suites with your own proprietary tests or testing providers. 

The {{< var validmind.developer >}} is designed to be model agnostic. If your model is built in Python, the {{< var vm.developer >}} provides all the standard functionality you may need without requiring you to rewrite any functions.

## Learn how to run tests

The {{< var validmind.developer >}} provides many built-in tests and test suites which make it easy for developers to automate their model documentation. Start by running a pre-made test, then modify it, and finally create your own test:

## What's next

After you have tried out the {{< var validmind.developer >}}, continue [working with your model documentation](/guide/model-documentation/working-with-model-documentation.qmd) in the {{< var validmind.platform >}} online. There, you can:

- Work with documentation templates to customize them to your specific needs
- Work with model documentation in the {{< var vm.platform >}} to make edits, collaborate with validators, and submit your model documentation for approval
- Export your finalized model documentation
