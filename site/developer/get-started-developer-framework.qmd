The {{< var validmind.developer >}} helps you streamline model documentation by automating the generation of drafts. All you need to do is upload your documentation artifacts and test results to the ValidMind platform.

## What is the {{< var validmind.developer >}}?

ValidMind's {{< var vm.developer >}} provides a rich collection of documentation tools and test suites, from documenting descriptions of your dataset to validation testing your models for weak spots and overfit areas.

ValidMind offers two primary methods for automating model documentation:

- **Generate documentation** — Through automation, the {{< var vm.developer >}} extracts metadata from associated datasets and models for you and generates model documentation based on a template. You can also add more documentation and tests manually using the documentation editing capabilities in the {{< var validmind.platform >}}. 

- **Run validation tests** — The {{< var vm.developer >}} provides a suite of validation tests for common financial services use cases. For cases where these tests do not cover everything you need, you can also extend existing test suites with your own proprietary tests or testing providers. 

The {{< var vm.developer >}} is designed to be model agnostic. If your model is built in Python, ValidMind’s Python client library already provides all the standard functionality you might need without requiring your developers to rewrite any functions.

## Learn how to run tests

ValidMind provides many built-in tests and test suites which make it easy for developers to automate their model documentation. Start by running a pre-made test, then modify it, and finally create your own test:

## What's next

After you have tried out the {{< var vm.developer >}}, continue [working with your model documentation](/guide/model-documentation/working-with-model-documentation.qmd) in the AI Risk Platform ({{< var vm.platform >}}) online. There, you can:

- Work with documentation templates to customize them to your specific needs
- Work with model documentation in the UI to make edits, collaborate with validators, and submit your model documentation for approval
- Export your finalized model documentation
