- [x] Test results have already been documented via the {{< var validmind.developer >}} for your model.[^1] 
- [x] You are a `Developer` or `Validator`, or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^2]

## Add test results

{{< include /guide/model-documentation/_add-content-block.qmd >}}

5. Click {{< fa square-plus >}} and then select **Test-Driven Block**.[^3]

    - By default, the `Developer` role can add test-driven blocks within model documentation.
    - By default, the `Validator` role can add test-driven blocks within validation reports. 

6. Select test results using one of these methods:

   - Select the tests to insert into the model documentation from the list of available tests.
   - Search by name using **{{<fa magnifying-glass >}} Search** on the top-left.

   To preview what is included in a test, select it. By default, selected tests are previewed.

7. Click **Insert # Test Results to Document** when you are ready.

8. After inserting the results into your documentation, click on the text to make changes or add comments.[^4]


## View test result metadata

After you have added a test result to your documentation, you can view the following information attached to the result:

- History of values for the result
- What users wrote those results
- Relevant inputs associated with the result

1. In the left sidebar, click **Model Inventory**.

2. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^5]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Documentation** or **Validation Report**.

4. Locate the test result whose metadata you want to view. 

5. Under the test result's name, click on the row indicating the date of the latest changes.

    - On the test result timeline, click on the **{{< fa chevron-down >}}** associated with a test run to expand for details.
    - When you are done, you can either click **Cancel** or **{{< fa x >}}** to close the metadata menu.
