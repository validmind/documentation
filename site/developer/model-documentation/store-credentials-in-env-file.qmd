Learn how to store model identifier credentials in a `.env` file instead of using inline credentials. This topic is relevant for model developers who want to follow best practices for security when running notebooks.

## Why is this recommended?

Storing credentials in a `.env` file is considered a best practice for security. Embedding credentials directly within the code makes them more susceptible to accidental exposure when sharing code or collaborating on models. 

::: {.callout-important}
Keeing model credentials in a separate file also allows for precise access control and ensures that sensitive credentials are not publically accessible.

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] The model is registered in the model inventory.[^1]
- [x] You are a [{{< fa code >}} Developer]{.bubble} or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^2]

:::

## Steps

1. Create a new file in the same folder as your notebook and name it `.env`. 

   This is a hidden file, so you may need to change your settings to view it.

2. Locate the code snippet for your model:

   a. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.
   b. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^3]
   c. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **{{< fa rocket >}} Getting Started**.
   d. Locate the code snippet and click **{{< fa regular copy >}} Copy snippet to clipboard**. 

3. Paste the credentials into your `.env` file in the following format:
   
      ```yaml
      VM_API_HOST=<api_host>
      VM_API_KEY=<api_key>
      VM_API_SECRET=<api_secret>
      VM_API_MODEL=<model>
      ```

::: {.column-margin}
For example, if your credentials look like this:

```python
import validmind as vm

vm.init(
api_host = "https://api.prod.validmind.ai/api/v1/tracking",
api_key = "key123",
api_secret = "secret456",
model = "model789"
)
```

Then your `.env` file should look like this:

```bash
VM_API_HOST=https://api.prod.validmind.ai/api/v1/tracking
VM_API_KEY=key123
VM_API_SECRET=secret456
VM_API_MODEL=model789
```

:::


4. Insert this code snippet above your model identifier credentials:
   
   ```python
   %load_ext dotenv
   %dotenv dev.env
   ```

5. Remove the inline credentials from `vm.init()`.[^4]

   The updated code cell should now look like this: 
   
   ```python
   %load_ext dotenv
   %dotenv .env
   
   import validmind as vm
   
   vm.init(
   )
   ```

::: {.column-margin}
To enable monitoring when you are storing credentials in an `.env` file:^[[Enable monitoring](/guide/monitoring/enable-monitoring.qmd)]

```python
%load_ext dotenv
%dotenv .env

import validmind as vm

vm.init(
   monitoring=True
)
```

:::

6. Run the cell. Instead of using inline credentials, this cell will now load your model credentials from a `.env` file.
