Learn how to store project identifier credentials in a `.env` file instead of using inline credentials. This topic is relevant for model developers who want to follow best practices for security when running notebooks.

## Why is this recommended?

Storing credentials in a `.env` file is considered a best practice for security. Embedding credentials directly within the code makes them more susceptible to accidental exposure when sharing code or collaborating on projects.

Keeing project credentials in a separate file also allows for precise access control and ensures that sensitive credentials are not publically accessible.

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] The model is already registered in the model inventory.[^1]
- [x] You are a `Developer` or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^2]

## Steps

1. Create a new file in the same folder as your notebook and name it `.env`. 

   This is a hidden file, so you may need to change your settings to view it.

2. Locate the code snippet for your model.

   - These credentials can be found on the **Getting Started** page for models registered in the model inventory. 
   - Copy the values from this page and paste them into your `.env` file in the following format:
   
      ```yaml
      VM_API_PROJECT=<Project Identifier>
      VM_API_HOST=<API Host URL>
      VM_API_KEY=<API Key>s
      VM_API_SECRET=<API Secret>
      ```

3. Insert this code snippet above your project identifier credentials:
   
   ```python
   %load_ext dotenv
   %dotenv dev.env
   ```

   The updated notebook should look like this: 
   
   ```python
   %load_ext dotenv
   %dotenv .env
   
   import validmind as vm
   
   vm.init(
     api_host = "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/tracking",
     project = "..."
   )
   ```


4. Run the cell. Instead of using inline credentials, this cell will now load your project credentials from a `.env` file.
