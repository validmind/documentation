To use the testing landing page, in `_quarto.yml` uncomment out the internal testing sections in the `left` & `sidebar`. 

When you're done with your test, please move the folder/files from the `internal` folder into `../internal/testing` (**outside** of `/site`) and comment out the navigation links again in `_quarto.yml`. :)

Files created in this section must always be set to `search: false` to prevent them from showing up in the site search.
