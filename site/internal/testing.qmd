To use the testing landing page, in `_quarto.yml` uncomment out the internal testing sections in the `left` & `sidebar`. 

When you're done with your test, please move the folder/files from the `internal` folder into `site-unused/testing` and comment out the navigation links again in `_quarto.yml`. :)

## Footnotes styling

> For **[SC-5288](https://app.shortcut.com/validmind/story/5288/explore-alternative-footnotes-options-for-inline-links)**:

- All footnotes go in the bottom section of the source page, instead of haphazardly stuck in between things as we author!
- Footnotes can't involve `include` files, unfortunately, so we can't single-source definitions.
- However, footnotes **can** be hyperlinks, which is handy for our inline instructional asides.
- The numbering of footnotes is still manual, but at least they are collated in one section so we can tell how many there are at a glance.

### Defining styles
- Footnote styling can be defined globally (via `_quarto.yml`) or individually in each file's YAML header.
- While Quarto provides several places footnotes can live, `margin` is the only one that might work well for us as the others place them at the end of section/block/document etc. again taking readers away from the instructional text.

#### Syntax

```markdown
Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first line. 
    In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it isn't indented.
```

Output
: Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }
