## Create the source file

1. Create a new file for the single-source information. In this example, we’ll call it: `_source-file.qmd`

1. Copy and paste the instructions from the original file you’re extracting the information from

1. Replace all the numbered headings with `1.` and markdown will take care of the rest

1. Clean up any footnotes (by replacing them with inline links) etc.
 
## Include the source in the destination file

1. Return to your original file, and replace the extracted information with the new source file: `{{< include _source-file.qmd >}}`

1. Re-render the preview for the original file, to make sure that it looks and works as expected; make any necessary tweaks
