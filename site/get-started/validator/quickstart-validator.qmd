Use the {{< var validmind.developer >}} to run tests and validate a model, then attach your test results as evidence to your validation report in the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.

{{< include /get-started/common-assets/_before-you-begin.qmd >}}

## Register a model for validation

In a usual model lifecycle, a champion model will have been independently registered in your model inventory and submitted to you for validation.

For this quickstart, we'll have you register a dummy model and assign yourself as the validator to familiarize you with the {{< var validmind.platform >}} interface:

{{< include /get-started/common-assets/_register-your-first-model.qmd >}}

#### Assign validator credentials

In order to log tests as a validator instead of as a developer, we'll need to adjust your **model stakeholder** permissions.

On the model details page after you've registered your model:

1. Remove yourself as a model owner ‚Äî

    a. Click on the **[owners]{.smallcaps}** tile, then click on the **x** next to your name.
    b. Click **Save** to apply your changes to that role.

2. Remove yourself as a developer ‚Äî

    a. Click on the **[developers]{.smallcaps}** tile, then click on the **x** next to your name.
    b. Click **Save** to apply your changes to that role.

3. Add yourself as a validator ‚Äî

    a. Click on the **[validators]{.smallcaps}** tile, and select your name from the drop-down menu.
    b. Click **Save** to apply your changes to that role.

## Using the {{< var validmind.developer >}}

Next, let's set up the {{< var validmind.developer >}} in your validation environment of choice so we can use it to run and log tests, which will help automate the validation of your models.

Our companion notebook, **Quickstart for model validation,**[^1] will walk you through the steps of installing the {{< var vm.developer >}} in your environment, initializing the {{< var vm.developer >}} for use, and running data quality and model evaluation tests that will log the results to the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.

{{< include /get-started/common-assets/_access-quickstart-notebook.qmd >}}

<!-- NOT LIVE ON JUPYTERHUB YET, HASN'T BEEN UPDATED -->
1. Open [Quickstart for model validation]({{< var url.jupyterhub >}}/hub/user-redirect/lab/tree/quickstart/quickstart_model_validation.ipynb) and [run the quickstart notebook](#run-the-quickstart-notebook).

{{< include /get-started/common-assets/_download-notebooks.qmd >}}

1. After the cloning process is complete, open `notebooks/quickstart/quickstart_model_validation.ipynb` in your developer environment and [run the quickstart notebook](#run-the-quickstart-notebook).

{{< include /get-started/common-assets/_download-code-samples.qmd >}}

1. Open `notebooks/quickstart/quickstart_model_validation.ipynb` in your developer environment and [run the quickstart notebook](#run-the-quickstart-notebook).

{{< include /get-started/common-assets/_run-quickstart-notebook.qmd >}}

::: {.column-margin}
**Example success message:**

```bash
2024-10-08 22:06:42,610 - INFO(validmind.api_client): üéâ Connected to {{< var vm.product >}}!
üìä Model: [ValidMind] Model validation quickstart (ID: cmalgf3qi02ce199qm3rdkl46)
üìÅ Document Type: model_validation
```
:::

3. Continue running the rest of the notebook to automatically populate test results for your sample model to your validation report for that model in the {{< var vm.platform >}}.

## Add evidence to your validation report

After you successfully run the notebook, return to the {{< var validmind.platform >}}:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Locate or search for the model you registered for this quickstart and click on it to select it.[^2]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for the model, click **{{< fa shield >}} Validation Report**.

   - Your model's validation is broken down into sections, defined by your validation report templates.[^3]
   - Each section can be assigned a completion status,[^4] allowing you to track the progress of your documentation.*

4. Click on any section of the validation to attach your test results and drafts of test result summaries generated by the {{< var validmind.developer >}} as evidence.

   In any subsection, expand the **{{< var vm.product >}} Insights‚Ñ¢** panel to view the Documentation Guidelines[^5] that tell you more about what these sections mean and help you with the task of documenting the model as a developer.*
