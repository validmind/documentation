First, let's take a look at how the {{< var vm.product >}} handles model documentation. The best place to start is with the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.

<!-- Using the variable in alt text messes up the image display  -->

![{{< var validmind.platform >}} main dashboard](platform-dashboard.png){width=90% fig-alt="A screenshot showing the ValidMind Platform main dashboard" .screenshot}

The {{< var validmind.platform >}} is the central place to: 

- Work with model documentation and test results uploaded with the {{< var validmind.developer >}}.
- Prepare validation reports, work with model findings, and link evidence to findings.
- Collaborate with others, including model developers, model validators, and reviewers.

## Steps

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Locate or search for the `[QuickStart] Customer Churn Model` and click on it to select it.[^1]

3. On the model overview page that opens, you can find important information about the model, such as:

   - The use case
   - The owners, validators, developers, and business unit associated with the model
   - The risk tier, model status, and current version
   - Model findings, recent activity, and much more

::: {.callout title="Note the initial [model status]{.smallcaps}."}
This is the status that a model starts in as part of the default workflow, as defined by your organization.[^2] You can click **{{< fa arrow-right-arrow-left >}} See Workflow** to visualize the entire workflow that this model will go through.

4. In the left sidebar that appears for the model, you can find links to:

   - The model's **{{< fa book-open >}} Documentation**[^3]
   - The model's **{{< fa shield >}} Validation Report**[^4]
   - **{{< fa desktop >}} Ongoing Monitoring** plans[^5] for that model
   - Any **{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Model Findings**[^6]
   - All **{{< fa wifi >}} Model Activity**[^7]
   - And **{{< fa rocket >}} Getting Started** information for integrating with the {{< var validmind.developer >}}[^8]

5. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa book-open >}} Documentation**. 

   - Your model's documentation is broken down into sections, defined by your documentation templates.[^9]
   - Each section can be assigned a completion status,[^10] allowing you to track the progress of your documentation.

6. Under 2. Data preparation, select **2.1. Data description**. 

   <!-- Using the variable in alt text messes up the image display  -->

   ![Data description page in the {{< var validmind.platform >}} within a model's documentation](data-description.png){width=90% fig-align="left" fig-alt="A screenshot showing the data description page in the ValidMind Platform within a model's documentation" .screenshot}

   - This content is generated by the {{< var validmind.developer >}} and provides information about the dataset used, including histograms, information about dataset quality, and test results.
   - Sections that need your attention get flagged with [{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Requires Attention]{.bubble .yellow-bg}. These sections get flagged automatically whenever a test result is above or below a certain threshold.

7. Expand **3. Model Development** and any of the subsections to see information that has been uploaded by the {{< var vm.developer >}} about:

   - **Model Training**
   - **Model Evaluation**
   - **Model Explainability and Interpretability**
   - **Model Diagnosis**
   
   a. If you expand the **{{< var vm.product >}} Insights™** right sidebar, the Documentation Guidelines[^11] can tell you more about what these sections mean and help you with the task of documenting the model as a developer. 
   b. If you are a validator, this is also where you can add findings associated with a documentation section.[^12]

8. Finally, take a look at section **4. Monitoring and Governance**. 

   Sections like **4.1 Monitoring Plan** are not generated by the {{< var vm.developer >}}, but they get added by the model developer in the {{< var vm.platform >}}. You can add both new text and test sections, called *content blocks*[^13] to your model documentation.
