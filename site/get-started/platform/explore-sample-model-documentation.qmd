First, let's take a look at how the ValidMind handles model documentation. The best place to start is with the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.

<!-- Using the variable in alt text messes up the image display  -->

The {{< var validmind.platform >}} is the central place to: 

- Work with model documentation and test results uploaded with the {{< var validmind.developer >}}.
- Prepare validation reports, work with model findings, and link evidence to findings.
- Collaborate with others, including model developers, model validators, and reviewers.

## {{< fa star-of-life >}} Before you begin

- [x] To try out ValidMind, you need to be a registered user on the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.
- [x] Next, make sure you're [logged in to ValidMind {{< fa hand-point-right >}}](/guide/configuration/log-in-to-validmind.qmd).

## Steps

1. In the left sidebar, click **Model Inventory**.

2. Locate or search for the `[QuickStart] Customer Churn Model` and click on it to select it.[^1]

3. On the model overview page that opens, you can find important information about the model, such as:

   - The use case
   - The owners, validators, developers, and business unit associated with the model
   - The risk tier, model status, and current version
   - Model findings, recent activity, and much more

   ::: {.callout title="Note the initial [model status]{.smallcaps}."}
   This is the status that a model starts in as part of the default workflow, as defined by your organization.[^2] You can click **{{< fa arrow-right-arrow-left >}} See Workflow** to visualize the entire workflow that this model will go through.

4. In the left sidebar that appears for the model, you can find links to:

   - The model's **Documentation**
   - The model's **Validation Report**
   - **Ongoing Monitoring** plans for that model
   - Any **Model Findings**
   - All **Model Activity**
   - And **Getting Started** information for integrating with the {{< var validmind.developer >}}

4. In the left sidebar, click **Documentation**. 

   Under 2. Data preparation, select **2.1. Data description**. 

   <!-- Using the variable in alt text messes up the image display  -->

   ![](data-description.png){width=90% fig-align="left" fig-alt="An image showing the data description page in the platform UI" class="screenshot"}

   - This content is generated by the {{< var validmind.developer >}} and provides information about the dataset used, including histograms, information about dataset quality, and test results.
   - Sections that need your attention get flagged with `Requires Attention`. These sections get flagged automatically whenever a test result is above or below a certain threshold.

4. In the left sidebar, select **3. Model Development** and any of the subsections to see information that has been uploaded by the {{< var vm.developer >}} about:

   - Model training
   - Model evaluation
   - Model explainability and interpretability
   - Model diagnosis

   If you expand the **ValidMind Insights™** right sidebar, the _documentation guidelines_ can tell you more about what these sections mean and help you with the task of documenting the model as a developer. If you are a validator, this is also where you can _add findings_. 

5. Finally, take a look at section **4. Monitoring and Governance**. 

   Sections like **4.1 Monitoring Plan** are not generated by the {{< var vm.developer >}}, but they get added by the model developer in the {{< var vm.platform >}}. You can add both new text and test sections, called _blocks_ to your model documentation.
