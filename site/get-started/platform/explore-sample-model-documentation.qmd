First, let's take a look at how the ValidMind handles model documentation. The best place to start is with the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.

<!-- Using the variable in alt text messes up the image display  -->

![](platform-dashboard.png){width=90% fig-alt="An image showing the ValidMind Platform UI main dashboard"}

The {{< var validmind.platform >}} is the central place to: 

- Work with model documentation and test results uploaded with the {{< var validmind.developer >}}.
- Prepare validation reports, work with model findings, and link evidence to findings.
- Collaborate with others, including model developers, model validators, and reviewers.

## {{< fa star-of-life >}} Before you begin

- [x] To try out ValidMind, you need to be a registered user on the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.
- [x] Next, make sure you're [logged in to ValidMind {{< fa hand-point-right >}}](/guide/configuration/log-in-to-validmind.qmd).

## Steps

1. Click **Model Inventory**.

2. Locate or search for the `[QuickStart] Customer Churn Model` and select it.

   ![](customer-churn-model.png){width=90% fig-alt="An image showing the main page for the QuickStart Customer Churn Model"}

   On the model overview page that opens, you can find important information about the model, such as:

    - The use case
    - The owners, validators, developers, and business unit associated with the model
    - The risk tier, model status, and current version
    - Model findings, recent activity, and much more

   In the left sidebar, you can find helpful links to the _model documentation_, _model findings_, _validation report_, _(activity) archive_, and _getting started_ information for integrating with the {{< var validmind.developer >}}.

   ::: {.callout}
   Note that the model status is **In Initial Validation**. This is the status that a model starts in as part of the default workflow. You can click **{{< fa arrow-right-arrow-left >}} See workflow** to visualize the entire workflow that this model will go through.

3. In the left sidebar, select **Documentation** > **2. Data preparation** > **2.1. Data description**. 

   <!-- Using the variable in alt text messes up the image display  -->

   ![](data-description.png){width=90% fig-align="left" fig-alt="An image showing the data description page in the platform UI"}

   - This content is _generated by the {{< var validmind.developer >}}_ and provides information about the dataset used, including histograms, information about dataset quality, and test results.
   - Sections that need your attention get flagged with `Requires Attention`. These sections get flagged automatically whenever a test result is above or below a certain threshold.

4. In the left sidebar, select **3. Model Development** and any of the subsections to see information that has been uploaded by the {{< var vm.developer >}} about:

   - Model training
   - Model evaluation
   - Model explainability and interpretability
   - Model diagnosis

   If you expand the **ValidMind Insights™** right sidebar, the _documentation guidelines_ can tell you more about what these sections mean and help you with the task of documenting the model as a developer. If you are a validator, this is also where you can _add findings_. 

5. Finally, take a look at section **4. Monitoring and Governance**. 

   Sections like **4.1 Monitoring Plan** are not generated by the {{< var vm.developer >}}, but they get added by the model developer in the {{< var vm.platform >}}. You can add both new text and test sections, called _blocks_ to your model documentation.

Continue with [Register your first model](register-your-first-model.qmd) to learn more about using the {{< var validmind.platform >}} hands-on.
