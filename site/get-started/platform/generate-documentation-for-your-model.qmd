You are now ready to modify the QuickStart notebook you used earlier and run it to generate model documentation and test result with the {{< var vm_framework >}}. The resulting artifacts are then uploaded to your model documentation in the {{< var vm_platform >}}. 

## Before you begin

To try out ValidMind, you need to be a registered user on the {{< var vm_platform >}}.

::: {.callout title="Need an account for ValidMind?"}
Signing up is FREE â€” **[Create your account]({{< var vm_url >}})**.
:::

## Steps

1. Log in to the {{< var vm_login >}}.

2. In the left sidebar, go to the **Getting Started** section of your previously registered model^1^:

   ![](platform-getting-started.png){width=90% fig-align="left" fig-alt="The QuickStart notebook in Colab with the section showing that you need to replace"}

   The page that opens provides you with a _code snippet_ to use with the {{< var vm_framework >}}, including: 

   - `api_host`: The location of the ValidMind API
   - `api_key`: The account API key
   - `api_secret`: The account secret key
   - `project`: The project identifier

   This code snippet can be copied and pasted directly into your developer source code to integrate the {{< var vm_dev >}} and to be able to upload to the {{< var vm_platform >}}. 

   ::: {.callout}
   To follow best practices, you can also [store the credentials in a `.env` file](/developer/model-documentation/store-credentials-in-env-file.qmd) and pass them in via environment variables.
   :::

3. Locate the code snippet and click **{{< fa regular copy >}} Copy snippet to clipboard**.

4. Reopen the QuickStart notebook you accessed earlier ([in JupyterHub](/get-started/developer/try-with-jupyterhub.qmd), for example).

5. In the QuickStart notebook, replace the `vm.init()` lines that look like the following with your own client integration information from the earlier step when you registered your new model:

   ![](jupyterhub-secrets.png){width=60% fig-align="left" fig-alt="The QuickStart notebook in Colab with the section showing that you need to replace"}

6. Run each cell in the notebook:

   - Hover over each cell and click the {{< fa circle-play >}} **icon**; OR
   - Press `Shift + Enter` on Windows or `Cmd + Enter` if you are on a Mac
   
   The notebook will install the ValidMind library and then connect to the {{< var vm_platform >}}.

## What's next

You can now [switch back to the {{< var vm_ui >}}]({{< var vm_url >}}) to view the documentation that has been generated by the {{< var vm_dev >}}.
