You are now ready to modify the QuickStart notebook you used earlier and run it to generate model documentation and test result with the {{< var validmind.developer >}}. The resulting artifacts are then uploaded to your model documentation in the {{< var validmind.platform >}}. 

::: {.prereq}

## {{< fa star-of-life >}} Before you begin

- [x] To try out {{< var vm.product >}}, you need to be a registered user on the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.
- [x] Next, make sure you're [logged in to {{< var vm.product >}} {{< fa hand-point-right >}}](/guide/configuration/log-in-to-validmind.qmd).

## Steps

1. In the left sidebar, go to the **Getting Started** section of your previously registered model:[^1]

   ![Landing page for a model with the Getting Started section highlighted in the left sidebar](platform-getting-started.png){width=90% fig-align="left" fig-alt="A screenshot of the landing page for a model with the Getting Started section highlighted in the left sidebar" class="screenshot"}

   The page that opens provides you with a _code snippet_ to use with the {{< var validmind.developer >}}, including: 

   - `api_host`: The location of the {{< var vm.product >}} API
   - `api_key`: The account API key
   - `api_secret`: The account secret key
   - `model`: The model identifier

   This code snippet can be copied and pasted directly into your developer source code to integrate the {{< var vm.developer >}}, enabling it to upload to the {{< var validmind.platform >}}. 

   ::: {.callout}
   To follow best practices, you can also store the credentials in a `.env` file[^2] and pass them in via environment variables.
   :::

2. Locate the code snippet and click **{{< fa regular copy >}} Copy snippet to clipboard**.

3. Reopen the QuickStart notebook you accessed earlier.[^3] 

4. In the QuickStart notebook, replace the `vm.init()` lines that look like the following with your own client integration information from the earlier step when you registered your new model:

   ![QuickStart notebook in Colab with the section to be replaced highlighted](jupyterhub-secrets.png){width=90% fig-align="left" fig-alt="A screenshot showing the QuickStart notebook in Colab with the section to be replaced highlighted" class="screenshot"}

5. Run each cell in the notebook:

   - Hover over each cell and click the {{< fa circle-play >}} **icon**; OR
   - Press `Shift + Enter` on Windows or `Cmd + Enter` if you are on a Mac
   
   The notebook will guide you through installing the {{< var validmind.developer >}}, initializing the Python environment, and finally connecting the {{< var vm.developer >}} to the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.

## What's next

You can now [switch back to the {{< var vm.platform >}}](/guide/configuration/log-in-to-validmind.qmd) to view the documentation that has been generated by the {{< var vm.developer >}}.
