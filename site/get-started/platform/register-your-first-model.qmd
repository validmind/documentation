To be able to document models with the {{< var validmind_platform >}}, you need to register them in the model inventory first. Let's show you how. 

## Before you begin

To try out ValidMind, you need to be a registered user on the {{< var validmind_platform >}}.

::: {.callout title="Need an account for ValidMind?"}
Signing up is FREE â€” **[Create your account]({{< var vm_url >}})**.
:::

## Steps

1. Log in to the {{< var vm_login >}}.

2. In the left sidebar, navigate to **Model Inventory** and click **+ Register new model**.[^1]

   To register a model for use with the QuickStart notebook, select:
   
   - Documentation template: `Binary classification`
   - Use case: `Attrition/Churn Management`

   You can fill in other options according to your own preference. 

3. Click **Continue**.

   After the model is registered, you get initial model documentation and a validation report based on the documentation template.

## What's next

Continue with [Generate documentation for your model](generate-documentation-for-your-model.qmd) to learn how to use the QuickStart notebook you looked at earlier with your first model.
