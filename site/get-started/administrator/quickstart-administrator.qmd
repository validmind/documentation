Set up the foundational units for your organization within the {{< var validmind.platform >}}, prepare your organization for users, then grant access to your first user.

{{< include /get-started/common-steps/_before-you-begin.qmd >}}

## Set up your organization

First, let's set up the foundational units of your organization:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Workspace, select **Organization**.

3. Add business units and use cases as required by your organization.

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Add groups

{{< include /guide/configuration/_user-groups.qmd >}}

{{< include /guide/configuration/_add-groups.qmd >}}

### Add roles

{{< include /guide/configuration/_user-roles.qmd >}}

{{< include /guide/configuration/_add-roles.qmd >}}

#### Manage role permissions

{{< include /guide/configuration/_manage-role-permissions.qmd >}}

:::

## Invite your first user

Once you've set up at least one business unit, use case, group, and role, invite a user to join your organization:

{{< include /training/administrator-fundamentals/_invite-new-user.qmd >}}
