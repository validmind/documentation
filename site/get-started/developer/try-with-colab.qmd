Google Colaboratory (Colab) is a free Jupyter Notebook environment that runs in the cloud. You can work with, run, and download our sample Jupyter Notebooks from there.

#### About our Jupyter Notebooks
- **Notebooks from ValidMind are safe to run** — If you get a warning that this notebook was not authored by Google, we welcome you to inspect the notebook source.
- **Runtime errors** — We recommend that you not use the *Run all* option. Run each cell individually to see what is happening in the notebook. If you do see errors, re-run the notebook cells.

## Steps

1. Open the QuickStart notebook in Google Colaboratory: [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg){fig-alt="Open in Colab"}](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NLtjCFUZV2I_ttGUkiAL9uwGZK_SGUlw?usp=share_link)
