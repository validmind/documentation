Learn how to document a model with {{< var vm.product >}} on Google Colaboratory.

::: {.attn}

## {{< fa star-of-life >}} Before you begin

- [x] To try out {{< var vm.product >}}, you need to be a registered user on the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.
- [x] You must have access to [Google Colaboratory (Colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/).

Google Colaboratory (Colab) is a free Jupyter Notebook environment that runs in the cloud. You can work with, run, and download our sample Jupyter Notebooks from there.

#### About our Jupyter Notebooks
- **Notebooks from {{< var vm.product >}} are safe to run** ‚Äî¬†If you get a warning that this notebook was not authored by Google, we welcome you to inspect the notebook source.
- **Runtime errors** ‚Äî We recommend that you not use the *Run all* option. Run each cell individually to see what is happening in the notebook. If you do see errors, re-run the notebook cells.

:::

## Steps

1. Open the QuickStart notebook in Google Colaboratory: [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg){fig-alt="Open in Colab"}](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NLtjCFUZV2I_ttGUkiAL9uwGZK_SGUlw?usp=share_link)

   ![QuickStart notebook opened in Google Colab](google-colab.png){width=90% fig-alt="A screenshot showing the QuickStart notebook opened in Google Colab" .screenshot}

   The notebook will guide you through installing the {{< var validmind.developer >}}, initializing the Python environment, and finally connecting the {{< var vm.developer >}} to the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.

2. Click **File** > **Save a copy in Drive** to make a copy of the QuickStart notebook so that you can modify it.

    Alternatively, you can download the notebook source and work with it in your own developer environment.

3. Follow the instructions to run the first two code cells in the notebook, which will set the stage by installing and initializing {{< var vm.product >}}.[^1]

    Under the cell at bottom of the **Initialize the ValidMind Library** section, confirm that you see a success message that looks something like this:
    
    ```bash
    2024-10-08 22:06:42,610 - INFO(validmind.api_client): üéâ Connected to {{< var vm.product >}}!
    üìä Model: [Demo] Customer Churn Model (ID: clwqy70qd01my22ikc49paar9)
    üìÅ Document Type: model_documentation
    ```

    This message verifies that the {{< var vm.developer >}} works as expected as is connected to the correct model within the {{< var vm.platform >}}. 

You can now continue running the rest of the cells if you want to see how the demo notebook works or, to save some time, you can move on to the [Explore sample model documentation](/get-started/platform/explore-sample-model-documentation.qmd) to explore the {{< var vm.platform >}}. 


## What's next

Continue with [Explore sample model documentation](/get-started/platform/explore-sample-model-documentation.qmd) to learn more about using the {{< var validmind.platform >}} hands-on.
