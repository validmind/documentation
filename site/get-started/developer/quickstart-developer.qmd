Register your first model, use the {{< var validmind.developer >}} to run tests and document a model, and edit your generated model documentation using the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.

::: {.attn}

## {{< fa star-of-life >}} Before you begin

- [x] To try out {{< var vm.product >}}, you need to be a registered user on the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.[^1]
- [x] You'll also want to make sure that you're logged into the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.[^2]

:::

## Register your first model

The first step to using {{< var vm.product >}} to develop models is to register them in the **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**. 
   
2. Click **{{< fa plus >}} Register New Model**.

3. To register a model for use with this quickstart, select:

   - [what type of model is it?]{.smallcaps} ‚Äî `New Model`
   - [template]{.smallcaps} ‚Äî `Binary classification`
   - [use case]{.smallcaps} ‚Äî `Attrition/Churn Management`

4. Click **Register Model** to add the model to your inventory.

#### Get your code snippet

Before we move on, let's also retrieve the unique *code snippet* for your model that will enable you to connect your testing environment with the correct model in the {{< var validmind.platform >}}:

1. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **{{< fa rocket >}} Getting Started**.

2. Locate the code snippet and click **{{< fa regular copy >}} Copy snippet to clipboard**.

## Using the {{< var validmind.developer >}}

Next, let's set up the {{< var validmind.developer >}} in your developer environment of choice so we can use it to run and log tests, which will help automate the documentation of your models.

Our companion notebook, Quickstart for model documentation,[^3] will walk you through the steps of installing the {{< var vm.developer >}} in your environment, initializing the {{< var vm.developer >}} for use, and running a full suite of documentation tests that will log the results to the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.

### Access the quickstart notebook

You can either load the hosted version of our notebook, or download the notebook to run in your own local environment:

#### Load the hosted notebook (recommended)

1. Sign in to [JupyterHub]({{< var url.jupyterhub >}}) with your {{< var vm.product >}} login.

<!-- NOT LIVE ON JUPYTERHUB YET, HASN'T BEEN UPDATED -->
2. Open [Quickstart for model documentation]({{< var url.jupyterhub >}}/hub/user-redirect/lab/tree/quickstart/quickstart_model_documentation.ipynb) and **[run the quickstart notebook](#run-the-quickstart-notebook).**

#### Download the notebooks

##### Option 1: Clone the GitHub repository

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

3. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/validmind/validmind-library.git
   ```

4. After the cloning process is complete, open `notebooks/quickstart/quickstart_model_documentation.ipynb` in your developer environment and **[run the quickstart notebook](#run-the-quickstart-notebook).**

##### Option 2: Download the code samples

1. Download our selection of code samples: [`notebooks.zip`](/notebooks.zip)

2. Navigate to the location where you saved `notebooks.zip` and extract the contents.[^4]

3. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files.

4. Open `notebooks/quickstart/quickstart_model_documentation.ipynb` in your developer environment and **[run the quickstart notebook](#run-the-quickstart-notebook).**

### Run the quickstart notebook

1. Follow the instructions to run the first two code cells in the notebook,[^5] which will set the stage by installing and initializing {{< var vm.product >}}:[^6]

   - Hover over each cell and click the {{< fa circle-play >}} **icon**; OR
   - Press `Shift + Enter` on Windows or `Cmd + Enter` if you are on a Mac

   Under the cell at bottom of the **Get your code snippet** section, confirm that you see a success message that looks something like this:
   
   ```bash
   2024-10-08 22:06:42,610 - INFO(validmind.api_client): üéâ Connected to {{< var vm.product >}}!
   üìä Model: [ValidMind] Model development quickstart (ID: cmalgf3qi02ce199qm3rdkl46)
   üìÅ Document Type: model_documentation
   ```

   This message verifies that the {{< var vm.developer >}} works as expected as is connected to the correct model within the {{< var vm.platform >}}. 

2. Continue running the rest of the notebook to automatically populate test results for your sample model to your documentation for that model in the {{< var vm.platform >}}.

## Working with model documentation

After you successfully run the notebook, return to the {{< var validmind.platform >}}:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**. 

2. Locate or search for the model you registered for this quickstart and click on it to select it.[^7]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for the model, click **{{< fa book-open >}} Documentation**.

   - Your model's documentation is broken down into sections, defined by your documentation templates.[^9]
   - Each section can be assigned a completion status,[^10] allowing you to track the progress of your documentation.

4. Click on any section of the documentation to review the test results and drafts of test result summaries generated by the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.

   For example:
