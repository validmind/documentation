## {{< fa star-of-life >}} Before you begin

- [x] To try out {{< var vm.product >}}, you need to be a registered user on the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.[^1]
- [x] You'll also want to make sure that you're logged into the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.[^2]

:::

## Register your first model

The first step to using {{< var vm.product >}} to develop models is to register them in the **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**. 
   
2. Click **{{< fa plus >}} Register New Model**.

3. Enter in the following model details:

   - **Documentation template** ‚Äî `Binary classification`
   - **Use case** ‚Äî `Marketing/Sales - Attrition/Churn Management`

   You can fill in other options according to your preference.

4. Click **Register Model** to add the model to your inventory.

#### Get your code snippet

Before we move on, let's also retrieve the unique *code snippet* for your model that will enable you to connect your testing environment with the correct model in the {{< var validmind.platform >}}:

1. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **{{< fa rocket >}} Getting Started**.

2. Locate the code snippet and click **{{< fa regular copy >}} Copy snippet to clipboard**.

## Using the {{< var validmind.developer >}}

Next, let's set up the {{< var validmind.developer >}} in your developer environment of choice so we can use it to run and log tests, which will help automate the documentation of your models.

Our companion notebook, [Quickstart for model documentation](/notebooks/quickstart/quickstart_model_documentation.ipynb), will walk you through the steps of installing the {{< var vm.developer >}} in your environment, initializing the {{< var vm.developer >}} for use, and running a full suite of documentation tests that will log the results to the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.

### Access the quickstart notebook

You can either load the hosted version of our notebook, or download the notebook to run in your own local environment:

#### Load the hosted notebook (recommended)

1. Sign in to [JupyterHub]({{< var url.jupyterhub >}}) with your {{< var vm.product >}} login.

<!-- NOT LIVE ON JUPYTERHUB YET, HASN'T BEEN UPDATED -->
2. Open [Quickstart for model documentation]({{< var url.jupyterhub >}}/hub/user-redirect/lab/tree/quickstart/quickstart_model_documentation.ipynb) and **[run the quickstart notebook](#run-the-quickstart-notebook).**

#### Download the notebooks

##### Option 1: Clone the GitHub repository

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

3. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/validmind/validmind-library.git
   ```

4. After the cloning process is complete, open `notebooks/quickstart/quickstart_model_documentation.ipynb` in your developer environment and **[run the quickstart notebook](#run-the-quickstart-notebook).**

##### Option 2: Download the code samples

1. Download our selection of code samples: [`notebooks.zip`](/notebooks.zip)

2. Navigate to the location where you saved `notebooks.zip` and extract the contents.[^3]

3. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files.

4. Open `notebooks/quickstart/quickstart_model_documentation.ipynb` in your developer environment and **[run the quickstart notebook](#run-the-quickstart-notebook).**

### Run the quickstart notebook

1. Follow the instructions to run the first two code cells in the notebook,[^4] which will set the stage by installing and initializing {{< var vm.product >}}:[^5]

   - Hover over each cell and click the {{< fa circle-play >}} **icon**; OR
   - Press `Shift + Enter` on Windows or `Cmd + Enter` if you are on a Mac

   Under the cell at bottom of the **Get your code snippet** section, confirm that you see a success message that looks something like this:
   
   ```bash
   2024-10-08 22:06:42,610 - INFO(validmind.api_client): üéâ Connected to {{< var vm.product >}}!
   üìä Model: [ValidMind Academy] Model development (ID: cmalgf3qi02ce199qm3rdkl46)
   üìÅ Document Type: model_documentation
   ```

   This message verifies that the {{< var vm.developer >}} works as expected as is connected to the correct model within the {{< var vm.platform >}}. 

2. Continue running the rest of the notebook to automatically populate test results for your sample model to your documentation for that model in the {{< var vm.platform >}}.
