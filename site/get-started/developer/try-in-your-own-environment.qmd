Learn how to document a model with ValidMind locally in your own developer environment. You can either clone our open-source repository or download the code samples to run the notebook.

## {{< fa star-of-life >}} Before you begin

To try out ValidMind, you need to be a registered user on the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.

::: {.callout title="Need an account for ValidMind?"}
Signing up is FREE â€” **[Create your account]({{< var url.us1 >}})**.
:::

You should be familiar with using standard software development tools, including the command line, and have a developer environment set up locally, such as Visual Studio Code. 

- To run our sample Jupyter Notebooks locally, your developer environment must support Python {{< var version.python >}}.
- To clone our open-source repository, you must have access to [GitHub](https://github.com/). Alternatively, you must be able to download a `.zip` file containing our code samples that include the introductory Jupyter Notebook.

:::

## Option 1: Clone the open-source repository

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

3. Run the command: 

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework.git
   ```

4. After the cloning process is complete, open `notebooks/code_samples/quickstart_customer_churn_full_suite.ipynb` in your developer environment and run the first few cells in the notebook:

   - Hover over each cell and click the {{< fa circle-play >}} **icon**; OR
   - Press `Shift + Enter` on Windows or `Cmd + Enter` if you are on a Mac
   
   The notebook will guide you through installing the {{< var validmind.developer >}}, initializing the Python environment, and finally initializing the ValidMind Client Library by connecting to the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.
   
   Near the bottom of the **Initialize ValidMind** section, you should see a message like this:
   
   ```bash
   Connected to ValidMind. Project: Customer Churn Model - Initial Validation (xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)
   ```
   
   This message confirms that the {{< var vm.developer >}} works as expected. 

You can now continue running the rest of the cells if you want to see how the demo notebook works or, to save some time, you can move on to the next section to explore the {{< var vm.platform >}}. 

## Option 2: Download the code samples 

1. In a browser, download [`notebooks.zip`](https://docs.validmind.ai/notebooks.zip).

2. Navigate to the location where you saved `notebooks.zip` and extract the contents.

   Depending on your operating system, you can right-click on `notebooks.zip` and select **Extract All ...** or **Extract Here**, for example.

3. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files.

4. Open `notebooks/code_samples/quickstart_customer_churn_full_suite.ipynb` in your developer environment and run the first few cells in the notebook:

   - Hover over each cell and click the {{< fa circle-play >}} **icon**; OR
   - Press `Shift + Enter` on Windows or `Cmd + Enter` if you are on a Mac
   
   The notebook will guide you through installing the {{< var validmind.developer >}}, initializing the Python environment, and finally initializing the ValidMind Client Library by connecting to the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.
   
   Near the bottom of the **Initialize ValidMind** section, you should see a message like this:
   
   ```bash
   Connected to ValidMind. Project: Customer Churn Model - Initial Validation (xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)
   ```
   
   This message confirms that the {{< var vm.developer >}} works as expected. 

You can now continue running the rest of the cells if you want to see how the demo notebook works or, to save some time, you can move on to the next section to explore the {{< var vm.platform >}}.
