## Steps

1. In a web browser, open [Quickstart for model documentation](https://jupyterhub.validmind.ai/hub/user-redirect/lab/tree/quickstart_customer_churn_full_suite.ipynb).

   This link takes you to ValidMind's JupyterHub instance where you can log in with the Auth0 credentials for your ValidMind account to access the QuickStart notebook.

<!---
1. In a web browser, go to <https://jupyterhub.validmind.ai>.

2. Click **Sign in with Auth0**, enter your ValidMind email address and password credentials, and click **Continue**.

3. In the sidebar, double click the **QuickStart_Customer Churn_full_suite.ipynb** notebook:

--->

2. After the notebook opens, run the first few cells in the notebook:

   - Hover over each cell and click the {{< fa circle-play >}} **icon**; OR
   - Press `Shift + Enter` on Windows or `Cmd + Enter` if you are on a Mac
   
   The notebook will guide you through installing the {{< var validmind.developer >}}, initializing the Python environment, and finally initializing the ValidMind Client Library by connecting to the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.
   
   Near the bottom of the **Initialize ValidMind** section, you should see a message like this:
   
   ```bash
   Connected to ValidMind. Project: Customer Churn Model - Initial Validation (xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)
   ```
   
   This message confirms that the {{< var vm.developer >}} works as expected. 

You can now continue running the rest of the cells if you want to see how the demo notebook works or, to save some time, you can move on to the next section to explore the {{< var vm.platform >}}.
