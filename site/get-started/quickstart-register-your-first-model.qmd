To be able to document models with the {{< var vm_platform >}}, you need to register them in the model inventory first. Let's show you how. 

## Before you begin

To try out ValidMind, you need to be a registered user on the {{< var vm_platform >}}.

Signing up is FREE â€” **[Create your account]({{< var vm_url >}})**.

## Steps

1. Log in to the {{< var vm_login >}}.

2. In the left sidebar, navigate to **Model Inventory** and click **+ Register new model**.^1^

   To register a model for use with the QuickStart notebook, select:
   
   - Documentation template: `Binary classification`
   - Use case: `Attrition/Churn Management`

   You can fill in other options according to your own preference. 

3. Click **Continue**.

   After the model is registered, you get initial model documentation and a validation report based on the documentation template.
