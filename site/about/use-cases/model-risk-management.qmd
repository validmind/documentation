Model risk management (MRM) is a discipline focused on managing risk from models themselves. 

By defining how models are developed, validated, approved, monitored, and retired, MRM reduces model errors, supports safe and consistent model use, strengthens decision-making, and ensures that models are fit for purpose throughout their lifecycles.

Traditionally, the scope of MRM is narrower and more technical than AI governance, focusing specifically on the models that power decision-making.

## Focus areas

MRM addresses several key areas:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%" .pr3}

Development and documentation standards
: Establish clear standards for model development, including documentation of purpose, design, theory, and logic.

Independent validation and challenge
: Ensure models undergo rigorous independent validation to identify limitations and verify performance.

:::

::: {.column width="50%" .pl3}

Performance monitoring and drift
: Monitor model performance over time, detecting drift and degradation that may affect reliability.

Change control and remediation
: Manage model changes through controlled processes, tracking findings and remediation actions.

:::

::::

## Typical artifacts

MRM programs produce documentation that demonstrates sound practices:

- **Model inventories** — Centralized registries of all models and their metadata

- **Model documentation** — Comprehensive documentation of model design, development, and testing

- **Validation reports** — Independent assessments of model performance and limitations

- **Findings** — Issues identified during validation with remediation tracking

- **Monitoring evidence** — Ongoing performance metrics and drift analysis

## Using {{< var vm.product >}} for MRM

{{< var vm.product >}} supports MRM workflows through a unified platform:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%" .pr3}

Model inventory
: Track all models with customizable fields for materiality, tiering, and risk rating.

Documentation automation
: Generate model documentation through configurable templates and automated testing.

Validation workflows
: Configure independent validation processes with findings tracking.

Three lines of defense
: Support role separation for developers, validators, and auditors.

Ongoing monitoring
: Monitor model performance with alerts and drift detection.

Lifecycle
: Govern model development, deployment, monitoring, and retirement stages.

## Regulatory frameworks

{{< var vm.product >}} is designed to help organizations comply with MRM regulatory requirements:

### SR 11-7 (United States)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%" .pr3}

The Supervisory Guidance on model risk management was issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. It provides comprehensive guidance on designing and maintaining a robust MRM framework.

### SS1/23 (United Kingdom)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%" .pr3}

The Model Risk Management Principles for Banks, issued by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), set out comprehensive expectations for managing model risk in UK banks. The principles emphasize governance, strategic planning, model development, validation, and robust technical capabilities.

### E-23 (Canada)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%" .pr3}

The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) issued the Guideline on Enterprise-Wide Model Risk Management (E-23) for Deposit-Taking Institutions in Canada. E-23 sets out prudent practices for model development, validation, approval, use, and ongoing change management, including considerations for AI and machine learning models.
