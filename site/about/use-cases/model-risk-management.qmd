Model risk management (MRM) is a discipline focused on managing risk from models themselves. It defines how models are developed, validated, approved, monitored, and retired. The scope is narrower and more technical than AI governance, focusing specifically on the models that power decision-making.

## Focus areas

MRM addresses several key areas:

Development and documentation standards
: Establish clear standards for model development, including documentation of purpose, design, theory, and logic.

Independent validation and challenge
: Ensure models undergo rigorous independent validation to identify limitations and verify performance.

Performance monitoring and drift
: Monitor model performance over time, detecting drift and degradation that may affect reliability.

Change control and remediation
: Manage model changes through controlled processes, tracking findings and remediation actions.

## Typical artifacts

MRM programs produce documentation that demonstrates sound practices:

- **Model inventories** — Centralized registries of all models and their metadata
- **Model documentation** — Comprehensive documentation of model design, development, and testing
- **Validation reports** — Independent assessments of model performance and limitations
- **Findings** — Issues identified during validation with remediation tracking
- **Monitoring evidence** — Ongoing performance metrics and drift analysis

## Regulatory frameworks

{{< var vm.product >}} is designed to help organizations comply with MRM regulatory requirements:

### SR 11-7 (United States)

The Supervisory Guidance on model risk management issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. It provides comprehensive guidance on developing and maintaining a robust MRM framework.

### SS1/23 (United Kingdom)

The Model Risk Management Principles for Banks issued by the Prudential Regulation Authority. It outlines principles for managing model risk effectively with emphasis on strategic planning and technical capabilities.
