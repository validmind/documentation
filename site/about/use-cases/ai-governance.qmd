AI governance is the organizational framework for directing and overseeing how AI is designed, deployed, and used. It sets policy, accountability, and decision rights, covering ethics, compliance, risk appetite, lifecycle controls, and ongoing oversight across people, process, and technology.

## Unit of management

In AI governance, the primary unit of management is the **AI system** or **AI use case** — not the individual model. This distinction matters because:

- An AI system may contain multiple models, rules, or algorithms
- Governance focuses on how AI is used and its impact on stakeholders
- Oversight applies to both model-based and non-model AI applications

## Focus areas

AI governance addresses several key areas:

Accountability and ownership
: Define clear ownership for AI systems, including use case owners, business sponsors, and oversight committees responsible for decisions about AI deployment.

Acceptable use and ethical constraints
: Establish policies governing what AI can and cannot be used for, including ethical boundaries, prohibited applications, and acceptable risk levels.

Human oversight and operational controls
: Implement controls ensuring human involvement in AI-driven decisions, especially for high-risk or consequential outcomes.

Compliance and regulatory readiness
: Align AI usage with applicable regulations such as the EU AI Act, ensuring documentation, transparency, and audit readiness.

Lifecycle controls for deployment and change
: Govern how AI systems move from development to production, including intake processes, approval gates, and change management.

## Typical artifacts

AI governance programs produce documentation that demonstrates oversight:

- **Use case inventories** — Centralized registries of AI systems and their purposes
- **Impact assessments** — Evaluations of potential risks and harms
- **Approval records** — Documentation of governance decisions and sign-offs
- **Oversight logs** — Evidence of ongoing monitoring and human review
