AI governance is the organizational framework for directing and overseeing how AI is designed, deployed, and used. It sets policy, accountability, and decision rights, covering ethics, compliance, risk appetite, lifecycle controls, and ongoing oversight across people, process, and technology.

## Focus areas

AI governance addresses several key areas:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%" .pr3}

Accountability and ownership
: Define clear ownership for AI systems, including use case owners, business sponsors, and oversight committees responsible for decisions about AI deployment.

Acceptable use and ethical constraints 
: Establish policies governing what AI can and cannot be used for, including ethical boundaries, prohibited applications, and acceptable risk levels.

Human oversight and operational controls
: Implement controls ensuring human involvement in AI-driven decisions, especially for high-risk or consequential outcomes.

:::

::: {.column width="50%" .pl3}

Compliance and regulatory readiness
: Align AI usage with applicable regulations such as the EU AI Act, ensuring documentation, transparency, and audit readiness.

Lifecycle controls for deployment and change
: Govern how AI systems move from development to production, including intake processes, approval gates, and change management.

## Typical artifacts

AI governance programs produce documentation that demonstrates oversight:

- **Use case inventories** — Centralized registries of AI systems and their purposes
- **Impact assessments** — Evaluations of potential risks and harms
- **Approval records** — Documentation of governance decisions and sign-offs
- **Oversight logs** — Evidence of ongoing monitoring and human review

Inventory
: Captures record types, defines custom fields, and identifies stakeholders.

Workflows
: Manages review cycles, approval paths, and assigned tasks.

Documents & Templates
: Provides standard forms, reports, and documentation templates.

Regulations & Policies
: Includes internal policies, external regulations, and compliance frameworks.

Dependencies
: Maps data sources, LLM relationships, and interconnected systems.

Lifecycle
: Governs development, deployment, monitoring, and retirement stages.

Content Library
: Offers reusable components, a knowledge base, and additional resources.

### Model your AI inventory

Configure **primary record types** to match how your organization actually manages AI — whether that's an entire AI systems, the underlying large-language models (LLMs), use cases, tools, applications, data assets, or a combination thereof:

- Define custom record types beyond just large-language models.
- Add fields for risk classification, ownership, and business context.
- Capture the metadata that matters for your governance program.

### Include relationships and dependencies

Create **typed relationships** between records to map how AI components connect and depend on each other:

- Link AI systems to underlying LLMs, data sources, and applications.
- Visualize dependencies across your AI portfolio.
- Inherit properties and requirements through relationships.

### Drive governance based on change and materiality

Use **version-aware workflows** that differentiate between major and minor changes, triggering appropriate validation and approvals:

- Configure workflows that respond to change severity.
- Automate approval routing based on materiality.
- Track version history with full audit trail.
