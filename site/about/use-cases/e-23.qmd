OSFI Guideline E-23 (Enterprise-Wide Model Risk Management for Deposit-Taking Institutions) contains the most comprehensive treatment of AI among major MRM regulations, reflecting the 2027 effective date and the anticipated evolution of AI. The guideline focuses on achieving specific outcomes rather than following prescribed processes.

**Effective date:** May 1, 2027

## Overview

E-23 establishes expectations for federally regulated deposit-taking institutions in Canada to manage model risk effectively. It covers traditional MRM requirements while incorporating forward-looking considerations for AI and machine learning models.

## Traditional MRM requirements

E-23 aligns with established MRM frameworks, requiring:

- **Model inventory** — Comprehensive registry of all models
- **Development standards** — Clear documentation of model design and implementation
- **Validation framework** — Independent validation and effective challenge
- **Ongoing monitoring** — Performance tracking and periodic review
- **Governance** — Board oversight and clear accountability

## AI/ML-specific considerations

E-23 introduces enhanced requirements for AI and ML models. {{< var vm.product >}} helps you address these considerations:

### Explainability

Enhanced requirements for model interpretability ensure stakeholders can understand AI-driven decisions.

#### Steps

1. Configure documentation templates to capture explainability information.

2. Run interpretability tests to generate explanations.

3. Document the level of explainability appropriate for model risk tier.

4. Establish processes for explaining decisions to affected parties.

:::

### Alternative controls

Compensating controls for "black box" approaches where full interpretability is not achievable.

#### Steps

1. Document the rationale for using less interpretable models.

2. Implement enhanced monitoring as a compensating control.

3. Establish human oversight requirements.

4. Configure alerts for unexpected model behavior.

### Bias assessment

Evaluation of ethical implications and discrimination risks in AI models.

#### Steps

1. Run fairness and bias tests during development.

2. Document bias assessment methodology.

3. Establish thresholds for acceptable bias levels.

4. Implement ongoing bias monitoring.

### Autonomous decision-making

Governance for self-learning capabilities and automated decisions.

#### Steps

1. Document the scope of autonomous decision-making.

2. Establish human oversight requirements.

3. Configure review workflows for autonomous decisions.

4. Implement safeguards and intervention mechanisms.

### Model drift

Monitoring for performance degradation over time.

#### Steps

1. Configure ongoing monitoring for drift detection.

2. Set up alerts for performance degradation.

3. Establish thresholds for re-validation triggers.

4. Document drift monitoring methodology.

### Dynamic learning

Management of continuously updating models.

#### Steps

1. Document model update frequency and methodology.

2. Establish change control for model updates.

3. Configure validation requirements for dynamic models.

4. Implement rollback procedures.
