Implement E-23 Compliance using {{< var vm.product >}}.

{{< include _use-case-summary.qmd >}}

## Overview

OSFI Guideline E-23 (Enterprise-Wide Model Risk Management for Deposit-Taking Institutions)[^1] contains the most comprehensive treatment of AI among major MRM regulations, reflecting the 2027 effective date and the anticipated evolution of AI. By emphasizing outcomes over prescribed processes, E-23 ensures that institutions retain flexibility in how they achieve regulatory objectives.

This guide is organized around the expectations for federally regulated deposit-taking institutions in Canada to manage model risk effectively by covering traditional model risk management (MRM)[^2] requirements while incorporating forward-looking considerations for AI and machine learning models.

## Traditional MRM requirements

E-23 aligns with established MRM frameworks, requiring:

- **Model inventory** — Comprehensive registry of all models
- **Development standards** — Clear documentation of model design and implementation
- **Validation framework** — Independent validation and effective challenge
- **Ongoing monitoring** — Performance tracking and periodic review
- **Governance** — Board oversight and clear accountability

## AI/ML-specific considerations

E-23 introduces enhanced requirements for AI and ML models in addition to traditional MRM requirements. {{< var vm.product >}} helps you address these considerations:

### Explainability

Enhanced requirements for model interpretability ensure stakeholders can understand AI-driven decisions.

#### Steps

1. Configure documentation templates[^3] to capture explainability information.

2. Run interpretability tests to generate explanations.[^4]

3. Document the level of explainability appropriate for model risk tier.[^5]

4. Establish processes for explaining decisions to affected parties.[^6]

### Alternative controls

Compensating controls for "black box" approaches where full interpretability is not achievable.

#### Steps

1. Document the rationale for using less interpretable models.[^7]

2. Implement enhanced monitoring[^8] as a compensating control.

3. Establish human oversight requirements.

4. Configure alerts for unexpected model behavior.

### Bias assessment

Evaluation of ethical implications and discrimination risks in AI models.

#### Steps

1. Run fairness and bias tests[^9] during development.

2. Document bias assessment methodology.[^10]

3. Establish thresholds for acceptable bias levels.

4. Implement ongoing bias monitoring.[^11]

### Autonomous decision-making

Governance for self-learning capabilities and automated decisions.

#### Steps

1. Document the scope of autonomous decision-making.

2. Establish human oversight requirements.

3. Configure review workflows[^12] for autonomous decisions.

4. Implement safeguards and intervention mechanisms.

### Model drift

Monitoring for performance degradation over time.

#### Steps

1. Configure ongoing monitoring[^13] for drift detection.

2. Set up alerts for performance degradation.

3. Establish thresholds for re-validation triggers.

4. Document drift monitoring methodology.

### Dynamic learning

Management of continuously updating models.

#### Steps

1. Document model update frequency and methodology.

2. Establish change control for model updates.

3. Configure validation requirements[^14] for dynamic models.

4. Implement rollback procedures.

## Implementation checklist
