Implement SS1/23 compliance using {{< var vm.product >}}.

{{< include _use-case-summary.qmd >}}

## Overview

SS1/23 (Model Risk Management Principles for Banks)[^1] establishes principles for managing model risk effectively, with emphasis on strategic planning and technical capabilities for emerging technologies like machine learning and AI. By emphasizing **proportionate application**, SS1/23 ensures that implementation reflects institutional size and complexity.

This guide is organized around the expectations for the five core principles outlined in SS1/23:

1. Model identification and model risk classification

2. Governance

3. Model development, implementation, and use

4. Independent model validation

5. Model risk mitigants

## 1. Model identification and risk classification (Principle 1)

#### Purpose

Establish a structured approach to identify and categorize models within the MRM framework.

### Steps

1. Define model identification criteria:

   - Document what constitutes a model.
   - Establish criteria for inclusion in the MRM framework.
   - Consider edge cases (spreadsheets, vendor models, etc.).

2. Configure risk classification and tiering fields:[^2]

   - Set up model tier fields, such as Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3.
   - Add risk classification categories.
   - Configure validation based on tier.

3. Document materiality and complexity factors:[^3]

   - Establish materiality thresholds.
   - Document complexity assessment criteria.
   - Link complexity to governance requirements.

## 2. Governance (Principle 2)

#### Purpose

Establish structured oversight with clear responsibilities and authorities.

### Steps

1. Configure Senior Management Function (SMF) accountability:

   - Document SMF responsibilities for MRM.
   - Configure approval authorities.
   - Establish escalation paths to senior management.

2. Configure roles and responsibilities:[^4]

   - Define roles across three lines of defense.
   - Document responsibilities for each role.
   - Configure permissions accordingly.

3. Set up board oversight dashboards:[^5]

   - Create executive-level dashboards.
   - Configure key risk indicators.
   - Establish board reporting cadence.

## 3. Model development, implementation, and use (Principle 3)

#### Purpose

Ensure models are developed and used per MRM framework guidelines.

### Steps

1. Configure documentation templates aligned to SS1/23:[^6]

   - Select or create templates covering SS1/23 requirements.
   - Include sections for intended purpose and use boundaries.
   - Document development methodology.

2. Enforce development standards:

   - Document coding and development standards.
   - Configure quality gates in workflows.[^7]
   - Track compliance with standards.

3. Document use case and limitations:[^8]

   - Clearly state intended use cases.
   - Document known limitations.
   - Establish use boundaries.

## 4. Independent model validation (Principle 4)

#### Purpose

Implement objective validation to ensure models function as intended.

### Steps

1. Configure validation workflow for effective challenge:

   - Set up validation initiation workflows.
   - Ensure validator independence.
   - Define validation scope by model tier.

2. Document objective assessment:[^9]

   - Use validation report templates.
   - Document testing methodology.
   - Provide clear conclusions.

3. Implement findings and remediation workflows:[^10]

   - Track validation findings.
   - Assign remediation owners.
   - Monitor remediation progress.

## 5. Model risk mitigants (Principle 5)

#### Purpose

Implement controls to reduce potential adverse impact of model risks.

### Steps

1. Document controls:

   - Identify and document model controls.
   - Link controls to risks mitigated.
   - Track control effectiveness.

2. Configure monitoring and alerts:[^11]

   - Set up ongoing monitoring.
   - Configure performance alerts.
   - Establish response procedures.

3. Implement change management workflows:[^12]

   - Configure model change workflows.
   - Document change approval requirements.
   - Track change history.

## 6. ML/AI and emerging technology considerations

SS1/23 specifically addresses emerging technologies. {{< var vm.product >}} helps you implement these requirements:

### Steps

1. Implement additional controls for complex models:

   - Document enhanced validation requirements for ML models.[^13]
   - Implement interpretability documentation.
   - Configure enhanced monitoring.[^14]

2. Address dynamic adjustments and change management:

   - Document model update procedures.
   - Implement change tracking for dynamic models.
   - Configure validation triggers for model updates.

3. Document explainability and transparency:[^15]

   - Assess explainability requirements by model type.
   - Document interpretability approaches.
   - Implement transparency controls.

## Proportionality

SS1/23 emphasizes proportionate application. Consider:

- **Smaller institutions** — May apply simplified governance structures while maintaining core principles.
- **Complex institutions** — Require more sophisticated frameworks and controls.
- **Model tiering** — Higher-tier models warrant more intensive oversight.

Document your proportionality assessment and how it influences your MRM framework design.
