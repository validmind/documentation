Implement SR 11-7 compliance using {{< var vm.product >}}.

{{< include _use-case-summary.qmd >}}

## Overview

SR 11-7 (Supervisory Guidance on Model Risk Management)[^1] provides comprehensive guidance to financial institutions on developing and maintaining a robust model risk management framework. By emphasizing the three lines of defense model and the concept of "effective challenge" — SR 11-7 ensures that models are rigorously questioned and tested.

This guide is organized around the expectations for the three main areas outlined in SR 11-7:

1. Model development, implementation, and use

2. Model validation

3. Governance, policies, and controls

## 1. Model inventory setup

#### Purpose

Establish a comprehensive model inventory aligned to SR 11-7 requirements.

### Steps

1. Establish model definition criteria:

   - Define what constitutes a model in your organization.
   - Document inclusion and exclusion criteria.
   - Classify models by type and purpose.

2. Configure inventory fields:[^2]

   - Set up materiality and tiering fields.
   - Add fields for model purpose and business use.
   - Configure risk rating classifications.

3. Populate the inventory:[^3]

   - Register existing models.
   - Document model ownership and stakeholders.
   - Track model lifecycle status.

## 2. Model development documentation

#### Purpose

Document models according to SR 11-7 development standards.

### Steps

1. Configure documentation templates:[^4]

   - Select or create templates aligned to SR 11-7.
   - Include sections for purpose, design, theory, and logic.

2. Document purpose, design, theory, and logic:[^5]

   - Clearly state the model's intended use.
   - Document the theoretical basis.
   - Explain design choices and methodology.

3. Document data quality and relevance:

   - Assess and document data sources.
   - Evaluate data quality and limitations.
   - Document data transformations.

4. Track assumptions and limitations:

   - Document all model assumptions.
   - Identify known limitations.
   - Establish conditions under which the model should not be used.

## 3. Testing and outcomes analysis

#### Purpose

Test models for accuracy, robustness, and stability per SR 11-7 requirements.

### Steps

1. Run automated testing using the {{< var validmind.developer >}}:[^6]

   - Execute accuracy tests.
   - Run robustness and stability tests.
   - Document test results.

2. Perform sensitivity analysis and benchmarking:

   - Test model sensitivity to input changes.
   - Compare against benchmarks or challenger models.
   - Document performance boundaries.

3. Evaluate limitations and assumptions:

   - Test assumption validity.
   - Identify conditions where performance degrades.
   - Document testing coverage.

## 4. Independent validation (effective challenge)

#### Purpose

Implement independent validation aligned to SR 11-7's "effective challenge" concept.

### Steps

1. Configure validation workflows:

   - Set up validation initiation triggers.
   - Define validation scope and requirements.
   - Establish independence requirements.

2. Prepare validation reports:[^7]

   - Use validation report templates.
   - Document validation activities.
   - Summarize findings and conclusions.

3. Track findings and remediation:[^8]

   - Document validation findings.
   - Assign remediation owners.
   - Track remediation progress.

## 5. Ongoing monitoring and periodic review

#### Purpose

Implement ongoing monitoring per SR 11-7 requirements.

### Steps

1. Set up monitoring workflows:[^9]

   - Configure monitoring frequency.
   - Define monitoring metrics.
   - Establish escalation procedures.

2. Configure performance tracking and alerts:

   - Set up performance dashboards.
   - Configure threshold-based alerts.
   - Document alert response procedures.

3. Schedule periodic reviews:[^10]

   - Establish review frequency by model tier.
   - Configure review reminders.
   - Document review requirements.

## 6. Governance, policies, and controls

#### Purpose

Establish governance framework aligned to SR 11-7.

### Steps

1. Configure role-based access:[^11]

   - Set up roles for three lines of defense.
   - Configure permissions by role.
   - Ensure appropriate segregation of duties.

2. Configure approval workflows:[^12]

   - Set up model approval processes.
   - Define approval authorities.
   - Configure escalation paths.

3. Enable audit trail and compliance reporting:[^12]

   - Configure activity logging.
   - Set up compliance dashboards.
   - Generate audit reports.
