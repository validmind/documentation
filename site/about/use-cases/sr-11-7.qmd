SR 11-7 (Supervisory Guidance on Model Risk Management) was issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in 2011. It provides comprehensive guidance to financial institutions on developing and maintaining a robust model risk management framework.

## Overview

SR 11-7 establishes expectations across three main areas:

1. Model development, implementation, and use

2. Model validation

3. Governance, policies, and controls

The guidance emphasizes the three lines of defense model and the concept of "effective challenge" — ensuring models are rigorously questioned and tested.

## 1. Model inventory setup

**Purpose:** Establish a comprehensive model inventory aligned to SR 11-7 requirements.

### Steps

1. Establish model definition criteria:

   - Define what constitutes a model in your organization.
   - Document inclusion and exclusion criteria.
   - Classify models by type and purpose.

2. Configure inventory fields:

   - Set up materiality and tiering fields.
   - Add fields for model purpose and business use.
   - Configure risk rating classifications.

3. Populate the inventory:

   - Register existing models.
   - Document model ownership and stakeholders.
   - Track model lifecycle status.

## 2. Model development documentation

**Purpose:** Document models according to SR 11-7 development standards.

### Steps

1. Configure documentation templates:

   - Select or create templates aligned to SR 11-7.
   - Include sections for purpose, design, theory, and logic.

2. Document purpose, design, theory, and logic:

   - Clearly state the model's intended use.
   - Document the theoretical basis.
   - Explain design choices and methodology.

3. Document data quality and relevance:

   - Assess and document data sources.
   - Evaluate data quality and limitations.
   - Document data transformations.

4. Track assumptions and limitations:

   - Document all model assumptions.
   - Identify known limitations.
   - Establish conditions under which the model should not be used.

## 3. Testing and outcomes analysis

**Purpose:** Test models for accuracy, robustness, and stability per SR 11-7 requirements.

### Steps

1. Run automated testing:

   - Execute accuracy tests.
   - Run robustness and stability tests.
   - Document test results.

2. Perform sensitivity analysis and benchmarking:

   - Test model sensitivity to input changes.
   - Compare against benchmarks or challenger models.
   - Document performance boundaries.

3. Evaluate limitations and assumptions:

   - Test assumption validity.
   - Identify conditions where performance degrades.
   - Document testing coverage.

## 4. Independent validation (effective challenge)

**Purpose:** Implement independent validation aligned to SR 11-7's "effective challenge" concept.

### Steps

1. Configure validation workflows:

   - Set up validation initiation triggers.
   - Define validation scope and requirements.
   - Establish independence requirements.

2. Prepare validation reports:

   - Use validation report templates.
   - Document validation activities.
   - Summarize findings and conclusions.

3. Track findings and remediation:

   - Document validation findings.
   - Assign remediation owners.
   - Track remediation progress.

## 5. Ongoing monitoring and periodic review

**Purpose:** Implement ongoing monitoring per SR 11-7 requirements.

### Steps

1. Set up monitoring workflows

   - Configure monitoring frequency.
   - Define monitoring metrics.
   - Establish escalation procedures.

2. Configure performance tracking and alerts

   - Set up performance dashboards.
   - Configure threshold-based alerts.
   - Document alert response procedures.

3. Schedule periodic reviews

   - Establish review frequency by model tier.
   - Configure review reminders.
   - Document review requirements.

## 6. Governance, policies, and controls

**Purpose:** Establish governance framework aligned to SR 11-7.

### Steps

1. Configure role-based access

   - Set up roles for three lines of defense.
   - Configure permissions by role.
   - Ensure appropriate segregation of duties.

2. Configure approval workflows

   - Set up model approval processes.
   - Define approval authorities.
   - Configure escalation paths.

3. Enable audit trail and compliance reporting

   - Configure activity logging.
   - Set up compliance dashboards.
   - Generate audit reports.
