## Build with ValidMind

::: {.callout title="ValidMind style guide"}
The first step towards producing material for ValidMind is to familarize yourself with our [style guide](style-guide/style-guide.qmd).

Here at ValidMind, we embrace an [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) ideology. This means that we think expertise is inclusive, and is also open to evolving — there's always an opportunity to learn from each other, and help each other improve. 

As a member of the ValidMind community, we invite you to be part of our process. From our public documentation to the code behind our [{{< var vm.developer >}}](/developer/get-started-developer-framework.qmd), we've exposed the wiring for inspection in hopes that great minds think differently and dare to spark change.
