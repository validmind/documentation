A message can only make an impact when it is received, so presentation is (almost) everything.

## Comprehensive assistance
Conveying knowledge and empowering users starts in the product interface. While external documentation can be helpful for supporting advanced functionality, users should not be lost on the basics without further reading. 

- **Make it interactive.** Embedded user tutorials should exist whenever possible, and be intuitive and not obstructive. 
- **Show only what’s necessary when necessary.** Progressive disclosure^1^ can help guide workflows as well as minimize visual clutter.

## American English
While the ValidMind community spans far and wide, its heart finds its home in Palo Alto, California. When writing for ValidMind, keep things consistent by using American English^2^ spelling and grammar conventions.

## Titles
- Task titles should always start with a verb and nouns should be in the plural if they describe an object acted on. 
- For tasks that have child topic tasks, the starting verb should always be a gerund ("-ing").
- Reference titles should include only the name of the content described unless it emcompasses a broader range of topics, in which case the title should end in "reference".

## Formatting

### Sentence case
In general, follow sentence-style capitalization^3^ to minimize the confusion of when to capitalize and when not to capitalize. 

::: {.column-margin}

: **Sentence case** examples {.hover}

### Headings
- **Make them imperative!** Individual task headings are a call to action. Gerunds (“-ing”) are acceptable when introducing a set of instructions with individual tasks.  
- **Avoid numbered headings.** Most headers do not require numbering, as order can be discerned from context. Numbering headers can make it difficult to shift information around when information changes.  
- **Don’t use terminal punctuation.** While headings should be in sentence case, they are not sentences.

### Emphasis
Use emphatic styling sparingly, in order not to overwhelm the reader with visual distractions.

- **Bolding** — Some light bolding can be helpful to draw attention to core concepts. Bolding is also used to highlight UI elements that the user can interact with, such as links or buttons.
- **Italics** — Italics should not be used for emphasis, only for first uses of terms on the page to set the stage. 
- **Quotation marks** — Quotation marks should generally only be employed for quoting speech.

#### Callouts
We use two types of callouts^4^ to call attention to supplementary information or issue warnings:

::: {.column-margin}
^4^ Quarto's guide on [callout blocks](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html).
:::

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6}

::: {.callout title="`.callout`"}
For supplemental information. Notes and tips should follow this formatting.
:::

:::


::: {.g-col-6}

::: {.callout-important title="`.callout-important`"}
For warnings and caveats. Warnings, important information, and cautions should follow this format.

| `::: {.callout title="Example note or tip"}` | `::: {.callout-note title="Incorrect note"}` |
| `::: {.callout-important title="Example warning, important, or caution"}` | `::: {.callout-warning title="Incorrect warning"}` |
: **Callouts** examples {.hover}

#### Margin content
Keep hyperlinks in instructional text minimal — too many links can misdirect the user from the task at hand. This also solves the issue of links with nebulous descriptions that do not match article titles, or links whose destinations are not clear to the user such as "Read more." 

- When possible, instead of multiple inline links, make use of Quarto's margin content^5^ class.
- Use ^superscript^ numbers to link the information in the body of the text to the margin:

    ```md
    - The model is registered in the model inventory^1^

### Content types

#### Filenames
Filenames should generally match the title of the article^6^ or concisely summarize the content, and be descriptive but not overly lengthy. 

- Filenames for concepts should generally only be made up of nouns and end in `-overview` if they introduce a product area.
- Do not include extraneous keywords. 
- A good filename makes the contents obvious!

: **Filenames** examples {.hover}

#### Code
- Format code in its own code block^7^.
- Declare the code language within the pre-formatted block to properly trigger syntax highlighting.

Within a Jupyter Notebook, simply use a **code cell**^8^ rather than a markdown cell.

## Proper nouns
In the context of model risk management, proper nouns include specific models, laws, or regulations, such as "Basel IV" or "SR 11-7." These refer to specific frameworks or guidelines and you spell them with initial capital letters or exactly as indicated by official sources.

- Terms that are not proper nouns include general concepts such as "model validation," "stress testing," "risk assessment," and "backtesting." 
- These are common terms in the field and are not capitalized unless starting a sentence.

| Correct | Incorrect | 
|------|-----|

|   validation report  |  basel 4  |

### Product names
Within our documentation (`https://docs.validmind.ai/`), you are able to reference constants such as the {{< var vm_framework >}} and {{< var vm_platform >}} via variables^11^. 

- Use the variables shown on the table below instead of writing out the phrases to enable consistency between guides everywhere except for image alt text or Mermaid charts^12^.
- If product names need to be updated, simply amend the `_variables.yml` file^13^ to see changes reflected throughout all guides. 
- Please note that variables will not work within any of the Jupyter Notebook code samples^14^ as these are technically standalone files.
