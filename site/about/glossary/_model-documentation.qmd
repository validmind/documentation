<!-- IF A MODEL DOCUMENTATION CONCEPT NEEDS TO BE ADDED:

1. Create a new file under the `about/glossary/model_documentation` folder with the following structure `_doc-feature.qmd` (the `_` is mandatory for Quarto to retrieve the file as a single-source embed: https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/includes.html)
2. Embed it below in ABC order with the structure `{{< include model_documentation/_doc-feature.qmd >}}` 

These instructions update the documentation concept on `working-with-model-documentation.qmd` as well as the glossary. 

-->

{{< include model_documentation/_doc-intro.qmd >}}

{{< include model_documentation/_conceptual-soundness.qmd >}}

{{< include model_documentation/_data-preparation.qmd >}}

{{< include model_documentation/_model-development.qmd >}}
