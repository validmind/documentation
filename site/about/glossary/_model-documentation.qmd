Each section of your model documentation should address critical aspects of the model’s lifecycle, from conceptualization and data preparation through development and ongoing management. This comprehensive documentation approach is essential for ensuring the model’s reliability, relevance, and compliance with business and regulatory standards.

conceptual soundness
: Establishes the foundation of the model, covering the model overview, intended use and business use case, regulatory requirements, model limitations, and the rationale behind the model selection. It emphasizes the model’s purpose, scope, and constraints, which are crucial for stakeholders to understand the model’s applicability and limitations.

data preparation
: Details the data description, including dataset summary, data quality tests, descriptive statistics, correlations and interactions, and feature selection and engineering. It provides transparency into the data used for model training, ensuring that the model is built on a solid and relevant dataset.

model development
: Discusses the model training, evaluation, explainability, interpretability, diagnosis, including model weak spots, overfit regions, and robustness. This section is vital for understanding how the model was developed, how it performs, and its areas of strength and weakness.

monitoring and governance
: Focuses on the model’s ongoing monitoring plan, implementation, and governance plan. It outlines strategies for maintaining the model’s performance over time and ensuring that it remains compliant with regulatory requirements and ethical standards.
