<!-- IF A MONITORING CONCEPT NEEDS TO BE ADDED:

1. Create a new file under the `about/glossary/monitoring` folder with the following structure `_monitoring-feature.qmd` (the `_` is mandatory for Quarto to retrieve the file as a single-source embed: https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/includes.html)
2. Embed it below in ABC order with the structure `{{< include monitoring/_monitoring-feature.qmd >}}` 

These instructions update the documentation concept on `ongoing-monitoring.qmd` as well as the glossary. 

-->

{{< include monitoring/_ongoing-monitoring.qmd >}}
