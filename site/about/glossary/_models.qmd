#### Models

model
: SR 11-7^[[SR 11-7: Guidance on Model Risk Management](https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1107.html)] defines a model as a "quantitative method, system, or approach that applies statistical, economic, financial, or mathematical theories, techniques, and assumptions to process input data into quantitative estimates."

model development
: An iterative process in which many models are derived, tested, and built upon until a model fitting the desired criteria is achieved.

model inventory^[**Refer also to:** [ValidMind model inventory](./glossary.qmd#platform-model-inventory)]
: A systematic and organized record of all quantitative and qualitative models used within an organization. This inventory facilitates oversight, tracking, and assessment by listing each model's purpose, characteristics, owners, validation status, and associated risks. 

model lifecycle
: Subset of stages defining the lifecycle of a model; encompasses all steps for operating, governing, and maintaining a model until it is decommissioned (model development, model validation, model approval, model implementation, retirement). 

model risk
: The potential for financial loss, incorrect decisions, or unintended consequences resulting from errors or inaccuracies in AI or machine learning models. Model risk typically arises from incorrect or inappropriate use of models, inaccurate assumptions, or limitations in data quality. 

For example, consequences of unmitigated model risk can include adverse outcomes such as financial loss, damage to reputation, and regulatory penalties.

model risk management (MRM)
: A structured approach to identifying, assessing, mitigating, and monitoring risks arising from the use of quantitative and qualitative models within an organization. Ensures that models are developed, validated, and used appropriately, with robust controls in place. Encompasses practices such as maintaining a model inventory, conducting periodic validations, and ensuring proper documentation.

model vendor
: A company that develops, documents, and sells models to financial institutions.
