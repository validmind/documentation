#### Model risk management

1st line of defense
: In the context of model risk, the business unit(s) responsible for model development, validation, and implementation during the model lifecycle. As the 1st line of defense, model developers must document and test models to ensure that they are accurate, robust, and fit for purpose.

2nd line of defense
: In the context of model risk, an independent oversight function that provides a governance framework for the model lifecycle. As the 2nd line of defense, model validators must independently validate and challenge models created by model developers to ensure that model risk management principles are followed. 

model developer
: Responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of models to ensure they are fit-for-purpose, accurate, and aligned with business requirements. As subject matter experts, they collaborate with model validators and other business units, ensuring the models are conceptually sound and robust. 

model documentation
: A structured and detailed record pertaining to a model, encompassing key components such as its underlying assumptions, methodologies, data sources, inputs, performance metrics, evaluations, limitations, and intended uses. Within the realm of model risk management, this documentation serves to ensure transparency, adherence to regulatory requirements, and a clear understanding of potential risks associated with the model's application.

model inventory
: A systematic and organized record of all quantitative and qualitative models used within an organization. This inventory facilitates oversight, tracking, and assessment by listing each model's purpose, characteristics, owners, validation status, and associated risks. Also see [ValidMind model inventory](#platform-model-inventory).

model risk management (MRM)
: A structured approach to identifying, assessing, mitigating, and monitoring risks arising from the use of quantitative and qualitative models within an organization. Ensures that models are developed, validated, and used appropriately, with robust controls in place. Encompasses practices such as maintaining a model inventory, conducting periodic validations, and ensuring proper documentation.

model risk
: The potential for financial loss, incorrect decisions, or unintended consequences resulting from errors or inaccuracies in AI or machine learning models. Model risk typically arises from incorrect or inappropriate use of models, inaccurate assumptions, or limitations in data quality. Consequences of unmitigated model risk can include adverse outcomes such as financial loss, damage to reputation, and regulatory penalties, for example.

model governance
: A framework of policies, procedures, and standards established to oversee the lifecycle of models within an organization. Ensures that models are developed, validated, implemented, and retired in a controlled and consistent manner, promoting accountability, transparency, and adherence to regulatory requirements.

model validation
: A systematic process to evaluate and verify that a model is performing as intended, accurately represents the phenomena it is designed to capture, and is appropriate for its specified purpose. This assessment encompasses a review of the model's conceptual soundness, data integrity, calibration, and performance outcomes, as well as testing against out-of-sample datasets. Within model risk management, model validation ensures that potential risks associated with model errors, misuse, or misunderstanding are identified and mitigated.

model validator
: responsible for conducting independent assessments of models to ensure their accuracy, reliability, and appropriateness for intended purposes. The role involves evaluating a model's conceptual soundness, data integrity, calibration methods, and overall performance, typically using out-of-sample datasets. Model validators identify potential risks and weaknesses, ensuring that models within an organization meet established standards and regulatory requirements, and provide recommendations to model developers for improvements or modifications.

three lines of defense
: A structured approach to model risk management, consisting of three independent functions. The first line consists of business units responsible for model development, validation, and implementation. They ensure that models are accurate, robust, and fit for purpose. The second line is an independent model risk oversight function that provides a governance framework and guidance for model risk management. The third line is the internal or external audit function, which assesses the effectiveness of model risk management practices and controls.

validation report
: A formal document produced after a model validation process, outlining the findings, assessments, and recommendations related to a specific model's performance, appropriateness, and limitations. Provides a comprehensive review of the model's conceptual framework, data sources and integrity, calibration methods, and performance outcomes. Within model risk management, the validation report is crucial for ensuring transparency, demonstrating regulatory compliance, and offering actionable insights for model refinement or adjustments.
