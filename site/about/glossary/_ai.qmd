artificial intelligence (AI)
: Artificial intelligence is a broad term used to classify machines that mimic human intelligence and human cognitive functions like problem-solving and learning. 

deep-learning
: A subset of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks (deep neural networks) to simulate the complex decision-making power of the human brain. 

generative AI (GenAI)
: Generative AI refers to deep-learning models that can generate high-quality text, images, and other content based on the data they were trained on.

large language model (LLM)
: Advanced types of artificial intelligence models designed to understand, generate, and interact with human language at a sophisticated level, such as ChatGPT.^[[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)]

machine learning
: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that allows for optimization. It helps make predictions that minimize the errors that arise from merely guessing. 

traditional statistical models
: Mathematical frameworks used to analyze and make inferences from data. These models are foundational in statistics and serve to explain relationships, predict outcomes, and guide decision-making across various fields, such as economics, biology, engineering, and social sciences.
