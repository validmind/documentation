A validation report is a comprehensive review that evaluates a model's accuracy, performance, and suitability for its intended purpose. It encompasses the process of model risk assessment, identifying areas of potential error or risk within the model's components, such as data inputs and algorithms. The report follows established validation guidelines to ensure consistency and adherence to internal and regulatory standards.
