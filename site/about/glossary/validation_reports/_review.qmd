review
: Entails a comprehensive evaluation process covering four key aspects of model documentation to ensure thoroughness, compliance, and reliability:

- **Conceptual soundness** — Examines the foundational elements of the model, including its overview, intended business use, regulatory requirements, and limitations. Ensures that the model's purpose, scope, and constraints are well-defined and understood by stakeholders.

- **Data preparation** — Assesses the quality and preparation of the data used for model training. Includes a detailed look at dataset summaries, data quality tests, descriptive statistics, correlations, interactions, and feature engineering. The aim is to verify that the model is built on a robust and relevant dataset.

- **Model development** — Focuses on the model's development process, including training, evaluation, explainability, interpretability, and diagnosis. Highlights the model’s performance, identifies strengths and weaknesses, and ensures that any potential issues such as overfitting are addressed. Evaluates the assumptions made and examines the qualitative information and judgments to ensure they are conducted appropriately and systematically.

- **Monitoring and governance** — Evaluates the ongoing strategies for monitoring the model's performance and ensuring compliance with regulatory and ethical standards. Involves checking the implementation of the monitoring plan and governance strategies to maintain the model's efficacy over time. Covers reporting outputs to ensure transparency and accuracy in the model's documented results.

These elements collectively ensure that the model documentation is thorough, transparent, and meets all necessary standards and regulatory requirements.
