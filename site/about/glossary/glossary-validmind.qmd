#### ValidMind platform

client library, Python client library
: Enables the interaction of your development environment with the ValidMind platform as part of the developer framework.

documentation automation
: A core benefit of the ValidMind platform that allows for the automatic creation of model documentation using predefined templates and test suites.

model inventory <span id="platform-model-inventory">
: A feature of the ValidMind platform where you can track, manage, and oversee the lifecycle of models. Covers the full model lifecycle, including customizable documentation and approval workflows for different user roles, status and activity tracking, and periodic revalidation.

template, documentation template
: Functions as a test suite and lays out the structure of model documentation, segmented into various sections and sub-sections. ValidMind templates come with pre-defined sections, similar to test placeholders, including boilerplates and spaces designated for documentation and test results. When rendered, produces a document that model developers can use for model validation.

test
: Runs a specific quantitative test provided by the ValidMind Developer Framework on the dataset or model. Test results are sent to the ValidMind platform to generate the model documentation according to the template that is associated with the documentation.

test suite
: A collection of tests which are run together to generate model documentation end-to-end for specific use-cases. For example, the `classifier_full_suite` test suite runs the `tabular_dataset` and `classifier` test suites to fully document the data and model sections for binary classification model use-cases.

{{< var vm_framework >}} ({{< var vm_dev >}}) <span id="framework">
: A suite of documentation tools and test suites designed to document models, test models for weaknesses, and identify overfit areas. Enables automating the generation of model documentation by uploading documentation, metrics, and test results to the ValidMind platform.

{{< var vm_platform >}} ({{< var vm_ui >}})  <span id="platform">
: A hosted multi-tenant architecture that includes the cloud-based web interface, APIs, databases, documentation and validation engine, and various internal services.
