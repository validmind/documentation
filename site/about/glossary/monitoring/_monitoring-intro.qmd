Monitoring of model performance in model risk management involves regularly assessing a model's accuracy, stability, and effectiveness to ensure it remains reliable after deployment. 

- This effort includes tracking key performance indicators, detecting model drift, recalibrating as needed, and validating assumptions. 
- It also encompasses backtesting to verify predictive power, maintaining transparent reporting and governance, and ensuring ongoing compliance with regulatory standards. 
- Continuous monitoring is essential for sustaining the model's integrity and mitigating risks associated with its use.
