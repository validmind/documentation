Monitoring of model performance in model risk management involves regularly assessing a model's accuracy, stability, and effectiveness to ensure it remains reliable after deployment. This includes tracking key performance indicators, detecting model drift, recalibrating as needed, and validating assumptions. It also encompasses backtesting to verify predictive power, maintaining transparent reporting and governance, and ensuring ongoing compliance with regulatory standards. This continuous process is essential for sustaining the model's integrity and mitigating risks associated with its use.
