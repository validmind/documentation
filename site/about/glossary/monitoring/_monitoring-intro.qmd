Monitoring of model performance in model risk management involves regularly assessing a model's accuracy, stability, and robustness to ensure it remains reliable after deployment. 

Monitoring is a critical component of model risk management, as emphasized in regulations such as SR 11-7, SS1/23, and E-24, and includes:

- Tracking key performance indicators, detecting model drift, recalibrating as needed, and validating assumptions. 
- Backtesting to verify predictive power, maintaining transparent reporting and governance, and ensuring ongoing compliance with regulatory standards. 
- Continuous monitoring to sustain the model's integrity and mitigating risks associated with its use as they arise.
