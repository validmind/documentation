metrics, custom metrics
: Metrics are a subset of tests that do not have thresholds. Custom metrics are functions that you define to evaluate your model or dataset. These functions can be registered with {{< var vm.product >}} to be used in the platform.

In the context of {{< var vm.product >}}'s Jupyter Notebooks, metrics and tests can be thought of as interchangeable concepts.
