<!-- IF A KEY CONCEPT NEEDS TO BE ADDED:

1. Create a new file under the `about/glossary/key_concepts` folder with the following structure `_concept.qmd` (the `_` is mandatory for Quarto to retrieve the file as a single-source embed: https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/includes.html)
2. Include it below with the structure `{{< include /about/glossary/key_concepts/_concept.qmd >}}`
3. In the `about/glossary` folder, locate the correct section file it belongs to (e.g. `_ai.qmd`) and embed it there as well in ABC order with the structure `{{< include key_concepts/_concept.qmd >}}` 

These instructions update the key concept on anywhere the key concepts are reference as well as within the glossary.
