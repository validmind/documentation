monitoring template
: Functions as a framework for structuring the monitoring of model performance, segmented into various sections and sub-sections. Monitoring templates define the structure of your model performance evaluations, specifying the metrics to be tracked, the tests to be conducted, and how the results should be displayed.

{{< var vm.product >}} monitoring templates come with pre-defined sections, similar to test placeholders, including boilerplates and spaces designated for documenting monitoring activities and results. When rendered, they produce a structured report that model developers can use for ongoing model performance evaluation.
