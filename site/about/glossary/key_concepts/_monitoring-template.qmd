monitoring template
: Functions as a framework for structuring the monitoring of model performance, segmented into various sections and sub-sections. Monitoring templates define the structure of your model performance evaluations, specifying the metrics to be tracked, the tests to be conducted, and how the results should be displayed.

ValidMind monitoring templates come with pre-defined sections, similar to test placeholders, including boilerplates and spaces designated for documenting monitoring activities and results. When rendered, they produce a structured report that model developers can use for ongoing model performance evaluation.
