A validation report is a comprehensive review that evaluates a model’s accuracy, performance, and suitability for its intended purpose. It encompasses the process of model risk assessment, identifying areas of potential error or risk within the model’s components, such as data inputs and algorithms. The report follows established validation guidelines to ensure consistency and adherence to internal and regulatory standards.

actions
: Recommended steps or measures to address findings from model validation or risk assessments.

evidence 
: Material provided by the developer and reviewed by the validator, such as model documentation, source code, datasets, monitoring reports or previous validation reports.

findings
: Observations or issues identified during model validation, including any deviations from expected performance or standards.

model risk assessment
: The process of identifying and evaluating risks associated with the use and potential errors in a financial model.

model risk areas
: Specific components or aspects of a model where risk might be present, such as data inputs, algorithms, or implementation.

ongoing monitoring report
: A periodic report assessing the model’s performance and compliance over time, ensuring it remains valid under changing conditions.

validation guidelines
: Established standards or procedures for conducting thorough and consistent model validations, usually aligned with principles within specific model or AI risk frameworks.
