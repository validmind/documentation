Choose the {{< var vm.product >}} deployment option that best suits your organization, ensuring secure data protection and seamless integration with your existing environment.

## Architecture overview

![{{< var vm.product >}} architecture overview](validmind-architecture-overview.png){fig-alt="An image showing the ValidMind architecture"}

In your own environment, model developers can continue to run models using your existing tools for data science and model development, such as Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and R, accessing data from sources such as Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, and Snowflake.

These models are then integrated with the {{< var validmind.developer >}}, which communicates with the {{< var validmind.platform >}} via our {{< var validmind.api >}}.

The {{< var validmind.platform >}} provides:

- **Model inventory** — Centralized tracking and organization of models, accessible by developers, validators, and executives.

- **Documentation & validation engine** — Automated testing and documentation, with validation processes, ensuring compliance with regulations and internal policies.

- **Template management** — Allows for easy creation, customization, and reuse of documentation templates.

- **{{< var vm.product >}} dashboard** — A user-friendly interface providing insights, status updates, and governance reporting for model risk.

## Security & data privacy

We ensure data security through strong data isolation, encryption, and role-based access controls.[^1] Personal identifiable information and customer data are not stored in model documentation. For more information, see our data privacy policy.[^2]

## Secure access

Deployments support secure access via private link, giving you full control over your resources without exposing traffic to the public internet. Integration options include:

- AWS PrivateLink[^3]
- Google Cloud Private Service Connect[^4]
- Azure Private Link[^5]

Additionally, all connections are secured with HTTPS/SSL to ensure encrypted communication.
