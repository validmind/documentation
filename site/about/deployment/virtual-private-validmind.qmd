Virtual Private {{< var vm.product >}} (VPV) is a _single-tenant architecture_ where a single organization has exclusive access to its infrastructure, providing greater control, customization, and security.

![Virtual Private {{< var vm.product >}} (VPV)](virtual-private-validmind.png){width="70%" fig-alt="An image showing a Virtual Private ValidMind (single-tenant) cloud deployment"}

Virtual Private {{< var vm.product >}} allows organizations to operate in a fully isolated environment, enhancing security and reducing shared infrastructure risks.

This option is ideal for high-compliance industries and also supports private link connectivity for secure access.
