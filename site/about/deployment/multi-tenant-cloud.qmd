With multi-tenant deployments, infrastructure is shared but with strict data isolation protocols that ensure that no tenant can access another’s sensitive information.

## What it is

A {{< var vm.product >}} multi-tenant cloud deployment allows multiple customers (tenants) to share the same software infrastructure while maintaining separate data environments. 

This approach maximizes resource efficiency, reduces costs, and simplifies management, as updates and maintenance are applied across all tenants simultaneously. 

Despite shared resources, data isolation is ensured, providing privacy and security. Multi-tenant deployments are ideal for businesses looking for scalability and reduced operational overhead, and they can be optionally enhanced with a **VPC connection** for secure access to on-premise networks.

## Benefits

- **Cost-efficiency** — By sharing infrastructure, tenants reduce the overall cost of ownership and operational expenses.
- **Scalability** — Resources can be easily scaled based on demand without needing significant infrastructure changes.
- **Streamlined updates** — Software updates and maintenance are handled centrally, ensuring all tenants benefit from improvements simultaneously.
- **Security** — ValidMind manages security through strong data isolation, encryption, and role-based access controls.

Overall, a multi-tenant deployment provides a cost-effective, scalable, and secure solution for organizations.
