A _multi-tenant cloud deployment_ for {{< var vm.product >}} allows multiple customers to share the same infrastructure while ensuring strict data isolation to protect each tenant's information.

## What it is

Multi-tenant deployments maximize efficiency by sharing infrastructure among customers while maintaining separate data environments. This approach reduces costs, simplifies management, and scales easily. Centralized updates ensure all tenants benefit from the latest features simultaneously.

Optional private link connections offer secure integration with on-premise networks.

## Benefits

- **Cost-efficiency** — Shared infrastructure reduces the overall cost of ownership.
- **Scalability** — Resources scale dynamically based on demand.
- **Streamlined updates** — Centralized software updates provide simultaneous benefits to all tenants.
- **Security** — {{< var vm.product >}} ensures security with data isolation, encryption, and role-based access control.

## Security

{{< var vm.product >}} implements a comprehensive security model for multi-tenant environments:

- **Data isolation**: Each tenant's data is securely separated to prevent unauthorized cross-tenant access.
- **Encryption**: Data is encrypted both in transit and at rest, ensuring protection against breaches.
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**: Access is limited based on roles, ensuring only authorized personnel can view or modify sensitive data.
- **Monitoring and logging**: Continuous monitoring detects threats, while audit logs track activity for accountability.
- **Compliance reviews**: Regular audits ensure adherence to industry standards and regulations.
