{{< var vm.product >}} is a suite of tools helping developers, data scientists and risk and compliance stakeholders identify potential risks in their AI and large language models, and generate robust, high-quality model documentation that meets regulatory requirements. 

Adept at handling many use cases, including models compatible with the Hugging Face Transformers API, and GPT 3.5, GPT 4, and hosted LLama2 and Falcon-based models (focused on text classification and text summarization use cases), {{< var vm.product >}} is purpose-built for model risk management teams.

In addition to LLMs, {{< var vm.product >}} can also handle testing and documentation generation for a wide variety of models, including:

- Traditional machine learning models (ML), such as tree-based models and neural networks
- Natural language processing models (NLP)
- Traditional statistical models, such as OLS regression, logistic regression, time series, etc.
- And many more model types

What sets {{< var vm.product >}} apart is its focus on simplifying complex tasks for both model developers and validators. By automating critical and often tedious aspects of the model lifecycle, such as documentation, validation, and testing, we enable model developers to concentrate on building better models. 

We do all of this while making it easy to align with regulatory guidelines on model risk management in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. These regulations include the Federal Reserve's SR 11-7, the UK's SS1/23 and CP6/22), and Canada's Guideline E-23.
