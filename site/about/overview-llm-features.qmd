{{< var vm.product >}} offers several specialized LLM-powered features to streamline model risk management and ensure regulatory compliance. Here's how we approach these features and what you need to know. 

## A philosophy of drinking our own champagne

At ValidMind, our approach to AI features, particularly in testing and risk management, reflects a philosophy of _drinking our own champagne_ or using our own products. This means that while we create risk management tools for our customers, we also rigorously apply these tools and practices within our own environemnt.

Our testing methodologies and philosophy around testing are available, and we openly share information about our approach. Specific test results are also available on request, allowing us to demonstrate the same standards of robustness and compliance that we promote for our users.

These LLM features in {{< var vm.product >}} enhance the efficiency and accuracy of model documentation, testing, and compliance workflows, equipping teams with the tools needed for robust model governance.

### Test interpretation

Interprets results from tests run within {{< var vm.product >}}. This feature generates a description of the tests, highlights key insights from the outcomes, and provides a summary with actionable takeaways, making it easier for developers and validators to understand the implications of each test.


### Risk assessment

Using data from test results, generates a tailored risk assessment for each section of model documentation. This feature aids in identifying potential risks based on the model’s performance and results, providing a foundation for better-informed decision-making.

### Qualitative checks

Leverages metadata from the model inventory, test outcomes, and additional data provided to create qualitative sections within model documentation. This feature ensures that essential contextual information is accurately documented and aligned with the model's purpose and scope.

### Document checker

Reviews model development documentation to ensure it aligns with relevant regulatory requirements. Helps teams maintain compliance with specific regulations by flagging areas that may need revision.

### Section checker

Assesses each part of the model documentation for adherence to internal guidelines and policies. This tool supports consistent documentation standards across the organization, promoting uniformity in compliance practices.

## A commitment to transparency

We believe in transparency across all our practices — not just because it’s essential to earn your trust, but because it’s the right thing to do. 

Understanding our policies shouldn’t feel like deciphering code, so we’ve made our legal texts as clear and accessible as possible. These documents cover the details of our practices, including data handling, privacy, responsible AI use, and regulatory compliance. 

We invite you to explore these policies and see how we put transparency into action every step of the way.
