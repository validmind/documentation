## Regulatory requirements

ValidMind's platform is designed to cater to the regulatory compliance and model risk management (MRM) requirements of financial institutions, facilitating enhanced compliance with government regulations, policies concerning MRM, and emerging legislations addressing AI model risk, including risks associated with the use of large language models (LLMs).

Examples of regulations or policies include:

### SR 11-7: Guidance on Model Risk Management
The Supervisory Guidance on model risk management issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in the United States in 2011. It provides comprehensive guidance to financial institutions on developing and maintaining a robust model risk management framework, covering aspects like model development, implementation, use, and validation. SR 11-7 is widely recognized and has become a benchmark in the industry for model risk management practices.

SR 11-7 outlines these core requirements: 
 
Model Risk Management
: - Identify and mitigate risks associated with incorrect or inappropriate model usage, outputs, or implementation errors.
- Encourage "effective challenge" to identify model limitations and propose necessary changes.
- Consider materiality in model risk management based on the extent of model usage and its impact on the organization's financial condition.

Model Development, Implementation, and Use
: - Develop with a clear statement of purpose, sound design, theory, and logic.
- Assess rigorously data quality and relevance, robust methodologies, and appropriate documentation.
- Test to ensure accuracy, robustness, stability, and to evaluate limitations and assumptions.

Model Validation
: - Be an integral part for managing model risk, ensuring models perform as intended.
- Identify and address potential errors or misuses.

Governance, Policies, and Controls
: - Establish a sound governance framework to oversee model risk management.
- Implement policies and controls for appropriate use and validation of models.

The regulation also mandates ongoing monitoring and periodic reviews to ensure models remain valid and effective.

### SS1/23 – Model Risk Management Principles for Banks
A policy issued by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) in the UK. It encapsulates the final model risk management principles following feedback on the earlier consultation paper CP6/22. The statement provides guidelines for banks in the UK on managing model risk effectively, with particular emphasis on strategic planning and technical capabilities. It outlines principles and amendments, like clarifications on model complexity factors, senior management function responsibilities, and inclusion of dynamic adjustments in model change management, aiming to standardize MRM practices across UK banks and foster the safe adoption of emerging technologies, such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and large language models (LLMs). 
:::

SS1/23 outlines these core principles:

Model Identification and Model Risk Classification
: - Ensure a structured approach to accurately identify and categorize models within the model risk management (MRM) framework.
- Facilitate the proper management and oversight of models, aiding in the alignment of model risk management efforts with organizational risks and objectives.

Governance
: - Establish a structured oversight mechanism for effective model risk management, delineating clear responsibilities and authorities.
- Ensure accountability, transparency, and effective communication within the organization regarding model risks and controls.

Model Development, Implementation, and Use
: - Emphasize the correct development, deployment, and utilization of models as per the guidelines laid down in the MRM framework.
- Ensure models are developed and utilized in a manner consistent with their intended purposes and within acceptable risk boundaries.

Independent Model Validation
: - Stress the importance of independent validation to ascertain model performance, accuracy, and identify potential issues.
- Provide an objective assessment of models to ensure they are functioning as intended and to identify any potential areas of improvement or correction.

Model Risk Mitigants
: - Underline the necessity for measures to mitigate risks associated with model use, including the identification and implementation of controls.
- Help in reducing the potential adverse impact of model risks on the organization’s financial condition, reputation, and regulatory compliance.

The regulation encourages a proportionate application of these principles based on the size and complexity of the institution.
