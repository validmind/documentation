## What is {{< var vm.product >}}'s data privacy policy?

The key points of our data privacy policy include:

## Do you comply with the SOC 2 security standard?

Service Organization Control 2 (SOC 2) is a type of audit report that evaluates the security and privacy controls of a service organization, such as a cloud vendor like {{< var vm.product >}}. The report provides assurance to customers that an organization has implemented effective security and privacy controls to protect sensitive data.

{{< var vm.product >}}'s security and privacy controls are designed to align with the stringent requirements of the SOC 2 standard. This compliance means that {{< var vm.product >}} has established and consistently maintains a set of security measures and protocols that meet or exceed the benchmark set by SOC 2. We also regularly review and update these controls to ensure that they stay current with evolving security threats and regulatory requirements. 

## Do you offer additional data privacy options?

The {{< var validmind.platform >}} is a secure, multi-tenant solution that can be hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure Cloud (Azure), or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). For organizations that require a stricter trust model and the highest level of security, such as financial services organizations handling highly sensitive data, {{< var vm.product >}} also offers a _{{< var validmind.vpv >}} (VPV)_ option to host our solution in a dedicated single-tenant cloud instance.

The {{< var validmind.vpv >}} option provides all our features and services but hosted within a separate environment that is isolated from other {{< var vm.product >}} accounts. VPV accounts do not share resources with non-VPV accounts.

Access is available through AWS PrivateLink, Azure Private Link, or GCP Private Service Connect, all of which provide private connectivity between {{< var vm.product >}} and your on-premises network without exposing your traffic to the public internet. 

## What model artifacts are imported into documentation?

When you generate documentation or run tests, {{< var vm.product >}} imports the following artifacts into the documentation via our {{< var validmind.api >}} endpoint integration:

- Metadata about datasets and models, used to look up programmatic documentation content, such as the stored definition for _common logistic regression limitations_ when a logistic regression model has been passed to the {{< var vm.product >}} test suite to be run.
- Quality and performance metrics collected from datasets and models.
- Output from tests and test suites that have been run.
- Images, plots, visuals that were generated as part of extracting metrics and running tests.

The {{< var validmind.developer >}} does not send any personally identifiable information (PII) through our {{< var validmind.api >}}.
