If your model is built in Python, ValidMind’s Python library will provide all the standard functionality without requiring your developers to rewrite any functions.\nThe Developer Framework provides a rich suite of documentation tools and test plans, from documenting descriptions of your dataset to testing your models for weak spots and overfit areas. The Developer Framework helps you automate the generation of model documentation by feeding the ValidMind platform with documentation artifacts and test results to the ValidMind platform."

Each stage of the model’s MRM lifecycle will constitute a new project, and may be configured with its own templates and workflows.\n\nModel documentation\n\nA comprehensive record and description of a quantitative model. It should encompass all relevant information about the model in accordance with regulatory requirements (set by regulatory bodies) and model risk policies (set by an institution’s MRM team), assumptions, methodologies, data and inputs, model performance evaluation, limitations, and intended use. The purpose of model documentation is to provide transparency, facilitate understanding, and enable effective governance and oversight of the model.\n\nTests\n\nA function contained in the ValidMind Developer Framework, which is designed to run a specific quantitative test on the dataset or model. Test results are sent to the ValidMind Platform to generate the model documentation according to the relevant templates.\n\nTest plans\n\nA collection of many tests which are meant to be run simultaneously to validate and document specific aspects of the documentation. For instance, the tabular_dataset test plan runs several descriptive and data quality tests on a structured dataset, and documents the results in the ValidMind UI.\n\nTest suites\n\nCollection of test plans which are meant to run together to automate generate model documentation end-to-end for specific use-cases.\n\nTemplates\n\nAn outline of the sections/sub-sections of a ValidMind document (model documentation or validation report) and how they are organized. Templates also contain boilerplates and documentation & test results placeholders for which content will be provided by the Developer Framework. Template requirements are typically provided by the model risk management team, and can be configured programmatically for each model use case, typically by an administrator."

Using PrivateLink can improve the security and compliance of your applications and data by keeping traffic private and reducing the attack surface of your network.\nAWS PrivateLink is a networking service that allows secure and private communication between Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) resources and services hosted in other VPCs or in AWS partner services, such as ValidMind. With AWS PrivateLink, you can connect to services over the Amazon network, without needing to expose your network traffic to the public internet.\nPrivateLink works by creating a private VPC endpoint for a supported AWS service within your virtual private cloud. This endpoint acts as a proxy between your VPC and ValidMind, allowing traffic to be routed privately over the AWS network. To make the endpoint easier to use, ValidMind provides a private DNS name that model developers and validators can connect to in a browser.\nThe responsibility of setting up a VPC endpoint for AWS PrivateLink falls to your IT department, such as the cloud engineering, infrastructure, or security teams.

    "text": "Training an Example Model\nWe will now train an example model that will be used to demonstrate the ValidMind Developer Framework functions. The following demo datasets are available to use, and on this notebook we’ll train a model for the Bank Customer Churn dataset.\n\nLoading demo dataset\n\nfrom validmind.datasets.classification import customer_churn as demo_dataset\n\ndf = demo_dataset.load_data()\n\n\n\nPreparing the training dataset\nBefore we train a model, we need to run some common minimal feature selection and engineering steps on the dataset:\n\nDropping irrelevant variables\nEncoding categorical variables\n\n\nDropping irrelevant variables\nThe following variables will be dropped from the dataset:\n\nRowNumber: it’s a unique identifier to the record\nCustomerId: it’s a unique identifier to the customer\nSurname: no predictive power for this variable\nCreditScore: we didn’t observer any correlation between CreditScore and our target column Exited\n\n\ndf.drop([\"RowNumber\", \"CustomerId\", \"Surname\", \"CreditScore\"], axis=1, inplace=True)\n\n\n\nEncoding categorical variables\nWe will apply one-hot or dummy encoding to the following variables:\n\nGeography: only 3 unique values found in the dataset\nGender: convert from string to integer\n\n\ngenders = {\"Male\": 0, \"Female\": 1}\ndf.replace({\"Gender\": genders}, inplace=True)\n\ndf = pd.concat([df, pd.get_dummies(df[\"Geography\"], prefix=\"Geography\")], axis=1)\ndf.drop(\"Geography\", axis=1, inplace=True)\n\nWe are now ready to train our model with the preprocessed dataset:\n\ndf.head()\n\n\n\nDataset preparation\nFor training our model, we will randomly split the dataset in 3 parts:\n\ntraining split with 60% of the rows\nvalidation split with 20% of the rows\ntest split with 20% of the rows\n\nThe test dataset will be our held out dataset for model evaluation.\n\ntrain_df, test_df = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.20)\n\n# This guarantees a 60/20/20 split\ntrain_ds, val_ds = train_test_split(train_df, test_size=0.25)\n\n# For training\nx_train = train_ds.drop(\"Exited\", axis=1)\ny_train = train_ds.loc[:, \"Exited\"].astype(int)\nx_val = val_ds.drop(\"Exited\", axis=1)\ny_val = val_ds.loc[:, \"Exited\"].astype(int)\n\n# For testing\nx_test = test_df.drop(\"Exited\", axis=1)\ny_test = test_df.loc[:, \"Exited\"].astype(int)\n\n\n\n\nModel training\nWe will train a simple XGBoost model and set its eval_set to [(x_train, y_train), (x_val, y_val)] in order to collect validation datasets metrics on every round. The ValidMind library supports collecting any type of “in training” metrics so model developers can provide additional context to model validators if necessary.\n\nmodel = xgb.XGBClassifier(early_stopping_rounds=10)\nmodel.set_params(\n    eval_metric=[\"error\", \"logloss\", \"auc\"],\n)\nmodel.fit(\n    x_train,\n    y_train,\n    eval_set=[(x_train, y_train), (x_val, y_val)],\n    verbose=False,\n)\n\n\ny_pred = model.predict_proba(x_val)[:, -1]\npredictions = [round(value) for value in y_pred]\naccuracy = accuracy_score(y_val, predictions)\n\nprint(f\"Accuracy: {accuracy}\")\n\nNow that we are satisfied with our model, we can begin using the ValidMind Library to generate test and document it.\n\n\nViewing all test plans available in the developer framework\nWe can find all the test plans and tests available in the developer framework by calling the following functions:\n\nAll test plans: vm.test_plans.list_plans()\nList all available tests: vm.test_plans.list_tests()\nDescribe a test plan: vm.test_plans.describe_plan(\"tabular_data_quality\")\n\nHere is an example:\n\nvm.test_plans.list_plans()\n\n\nvm.test_plans.list_tests()\n\n\nvm.test_plans.describe_plan(\"tabular_data_quality\")\n\n\n\nRunning a data quality test plan\nWe will now run the default data quality test plan that will collect the following metadata from a dataset:\n\nField types and descriptions\nDescriptive statistics\nData distribution histograms\nFeature correlations\n\nand will run a collection of data quality tests such as:\n\nClass imbalance\nDuplicates\nHigh cardinality\nMissing values\nSkewness\n\nValidMind evaluates if the data quality metrics are within expected ranges. These thresholds or ranges can be further configured by model validators.\n\nInitialize a dataset object for ValidMind\nBefore running the test plan, we must first initialize a ValidMind dataset object using the init_dataset function from the vm module. This function takes in arguements: dataset which is the dataset that we want to analyze; target_column which is used to identify the target variable; class_labels which is used to identify the labels used for classification model training.\n\nvm_dataset = vm.init_dataset(\n    dataset=df,\n    target_column=\"Exited\",\n    class_labels={\n        \"0\": \"Did not exit\",\n        \"1\": \"Exited\",\n    }\n)\n\n\n\nInitialize and run the TabularDataset test plan\nWe can now initialize the TabularDataset test suite. The primary method of doing this is with the run_test_suite function from the vm module. This function takes in a test suite name (in this case tabular_dataset) and a dataset keyword argument (the vm_dataset object we created earlier):\n\ntabular_suite = vm.run_test_suite(\"tabular_dataset\", dataset=vm_dataset)\n\nYou can access and review the resulting documentation in the ValidMind UI, in the “Data Preparation” section of the model documentation.\n\n\n\nRunning a model evaluation test plan\nWe will now run a basic model evaluation test plan that is compatible with the model we have trained. Since we have trained an XGBoost model with a sklearn-like API, we will use the SKLearnClassifier test plan. This test plan will collect model metadata and metrics, and run a variety of model evaluation tests, according to the modeling objective (binary classification for this example).\nThe following model metadata is collected:\n\nModel framework and architecture (e.g. XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)\nModel task details (e.g. binary classification, regression, etc.)\nModel hyperparameters (e.g. number of trees, max depth, etc.)\n\nThe model metrics that are collected depend on the model type, use case, etc. For example, for a binary classification model, the following metrics could be collected (again, depending on configuration):\n\nAUC\nError rate\nLogloss\nFeature importance\n\nSimilarly, different model evaluation tests are run depending on the model type, use case, etc. For example, for a binary classification model, the following tests could be executed:\n\nSimple training/test overfit test\nTraining/test performance degradation\nBaseline test dataset performance test\n\n\nInitialize VM model object and train/test datasets\nIn order to run our SKLearnClassifier test plan, we need to initialize ValidMind object instances for the trained model and the training and test datasets:\n\nvm_train_ds = vm.init_dataset(\n    dataset=train_df,\n    type=\"generic\",\n    target_column=\"Exited\"\n)\n\nvm_test_ds = vm.init_dataset(\n    dataset=test_df,\n    type=\"generic\",\n    target_column=\"Exited\"\n)\n\nvm_model = vm.init_model(\n    model,\n    train_ds=vm_train_ds,\n    test_ds=vm_test_ds,\n)\n\nWe can now run the BinaryClassifierModelValidation test plan:\n\nmodel_suite = vm.run_test_suite(\"binary_classifier_model_validation\", model=vm_model)\n\nYou can access and review the resulting documentation in the ValidMind UI, in the “Model Development” section of the model documentation."

This provides a convenient way to examine the time-delayed correlation between different series.\nCointegration: The engle_granger_coint key sets a threshold for conducting the Engle-Granger cointegration test, which is a statistical method used to identify the long-term correlation between two or more time series.\n\n\nconfig= {\n    \"regression_forecast_plot\": {\n        \"start_date\": '2010-01-01',\n        \"end_date\": '2022-01-01'\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nfull_suite = vm.run_test_suite(\n    \"time_series_model_validation\",\n    model = vm_model_B,\n    models = list_of_models,\n    config = config,\n)"

Data Validation\n\nUser Configuration of Test Suite\nUsers can input the configuration to a test suite using config, allowing fine-tuning the suite according to their specific data requirements.\nTime Series Data Quality params - time_series_outliers is set to identify outliers using a specific Z-score threshold - time_series_missing_values defines a minimum threshold to identify missing data points.\nTime Series Univariate params - Visualization: time_series_line_plot and time_series_histogram are designed to generate line and histogram plots respectively for each column in a DataFrame.\n\nSeasonality: seasonal_decompose and auto_seasonality are dedicated to analyzing the seasonal component of the time series. seasonal_decompose performs a seasonal decomposition of the data, while auto_seasonality aids in the automatic detection of seasonality.\nStationarity: window_size determines the number of consecutive data points used for calculating the rolling mean and standard deviation.\nARIMA: acf_pacf_plot, auto_ar, and auto_ma are part of the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model analysis. acf_pacf_plot generates autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots, auto_ar determines the order of the autoregressive part of the model, and auto_ma does the same for the moving average part.\n\nTime Series Multivariate params - Visualization: scatter_plot is used to create scatter plots for each column in the DataFrame, offering a visual tool to understand the relationship between different variables in the dataset.\n\nCorrelation: lagged_correlation_heatmap facilitates the creation of a heatmap, which visually represents the lagged correlation between the target column and the feature columns of a demo dataset. This provides a convenient way to examine the time-delayed correlation between different series.\nCointegration: engle_granger_coint sets a threshold for conducting the Engle-Granger cointegration test, which is a statistical method used to identify the long-term correlation between two or more time series.\n\n\nconfig={\n    \n    # TIME SERIES DATA QUALITY PARAMS\n    \"time_series_outliers\": {\n        \"zscore_threshold\": 3,\n    },\n    \"time_series_missing_values\":{\n        \"min_threshold\": 2,\n    },\n    \n    # TIME SERIES UNIVARIATE PARAMS \n    \"rolling_stats_plot\": {\n        \"window_size\": 12    \n    },\n     \"seasonal_decompose\": {\n        \"seasonal_model\": 'additive'\n    },\n     \"auto_seasonality\": {\n        \"min_period\": 1,\n        \"max_period\": 3\n    },\n      \"auto_stationarity\": {\n        \"max_order\": 3,\n        \"threshold\": 0.05\n    },\n    \"auto_ar\": {\n        \"max_ar_order\": 4\n    },\n    \"auto_ma\": {\n        \"max_ma_order\": 3\n    },\n\n    # TIME SERIES MULTIVARIATE PARAMS \n    \"lagged_correlation_heatmap\": {\n        \"target_col\": demo_dataset.target_column,\n        \"independent_vars\": demo_dataset.feature_columns\n    },\n    \"engle_granger_coint\": {\n        \"threshold\": 0.05\n    },\n}\n\n\n\nValidation of Raw Dataset\n\nRun the Time Series Dataset Test Suite\n\nvm_dataset = vm.init_dataset(\n    dataset=df,\n    target_column=demo_dataset.target_column,\n)\n\nfull_suite = vm.run_test_suite(\n    \"time_series_dataset\",\n    dataset=vm_dataset,\n    config = config,\n)\n\nPandas dataset detected.
