    "text": "What is ValidMind’s Developer Framework\nValidMind’s Python Developer Framework is a library of developer tools and methods designed to automate the documentation and validation of your models.\nThe Developer Framework is designed to be model agnostic. If your model is built in Python, ValidMind’s Python library will provide all the standard functionality without requiring your developers to rewrite functions.\nThe Developer Framework provides a rich suite of documentation tools and test plans, from documenting descriptions of your dataset to testing your models for weak spots and overfit areas. The Developer Framework helps you automate the generation of model documentation by feeding the ValidMind platform with documentation artefacts and test results to the ValidMind platform."

    "section": "ValidMind Documentation project structure",
    "text": "ValidMind Documentation project structure\n\nProjects: All documentation work in ValidMind is organized in projects which act as a container for the model documentation and validation report of your model. Each stage of the model’s MRM lifecycle will constitute a new project, and may be configured with its own templates and workflows.\nModel documentation: A comprehensive record and description of a quantitative model. It should encompass all relevant information about the model in accordance with regulatory requirements, set by regulatory bodies, and model risk policies set by an institution’s MRM team, assumptions, methodologies, data & inputs, model performance evaluation, limitations, and intended use. The purpose of model documentation is to provide transparency, facilitate understanding, and enable effective governance and oversight of the model.\nTests: A function contained in the ValidMind Developer Framework, which is designed to run a specific quantitative test on the dataset or model. Test results are sent to the ValidMind Platform to generate the model documentation according to the relevant templates.\nTest plans: A collection of many tests which are meant to be run simultaneously to validate and document specific aspects of the documentation. For instance, the tabular_dataset test plan runs several descriptive and data quality tests on a structured dataset, and documents the results in the ValidMind UI.\nTemplates: An outline of the sections and sub-sections of a ValidMind document (model documentation or validation report) and how they are organized. Templates also contain boilerplates and documentation or test result placeholders for which content will be provided by the Developer Framework. Template requirements are typically provided by the model risk management team and can be configured programmatically for each model use case, typically by an administrator."

Ensuring that models are conceptually sound and robust is crucial to minimize model risk.\n\nModel Validation:\n\nBusiness units also play a role in the validation process, collaborating with independent validation teams to ensure that models are fit for their intended purpose. This involves reviewing the model’s assumptions, methodologies, and data quality, as well as assessing the model’s predictive accuracy and stability. Validation provides assurance that the model’s assumptions and methodologies are appropriate and that the model is fit for its intended use.\n\nModel Implementation: - Business units are responsible for integrating models into the organization’s systems and processes. Proper implementation ensures that the model is used consistently and accurately, with adequate controls and documentation in place. Model users must be trained to ensure they understand the model’s purpose, limitations, and assumptions."

For instance, the tabular_dataset test plan runs several descriptive and data quality tests on a structured dataset and documents the results in the ValidMind UI."

Using PrivateLink can improve the security and compliance of your applications and data by keeping traffic private and reducing the attack surface of your network.\nAWS PrivateLink is a networking service that allows secure and private communication between Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) resources and services hosted in other VPCs or in AWS partner services, such as ValidMind. With AWS PrivateLink, you can connect to services over the Amazon network, without needing to expose your network traffic to the public internet.\nPrivateLink works by creating a private VPC endpoint for a supported AWS service within your virtual private cloud. This endpoint acts as a proxy between your VPC and ValidMind, allowing traffic to be routed privately over the AWS network. To make the endpoint easier to use, ValidMind provides a private DNS name that model developers and validators can connect to in a browser.\nThe responsibility of setting up a VPC endpoint for AWS PrivateLink falls to your IT department, such as the cloud engineering, infrastructure, or security teams. To learn more, check Access an AWS service using an interface VPC endpoint."

This involves selecting appropriate variables, data sources, and mathematical or statistical methods. Rigorous documentation and testing, including sensitivity analysis and stress testing, are crucial to ensure model soundness.\n\n\nModel Validation\nAn independent team evaluates the model’s conceptual soundness, performance, and compliance with regulatory requirements. This step involves reviewing the model’s assumptions, methodologies, and data quality, as well as assessing the model’s predictive accuracy and stability. Validation provides assurance that the model is fit for its intended use.\n\n\nModel Implementation\nAfter validation, the model is integrated into the organization’s systems and processes. Proper implementation ensures that the model is used consistently and accurately, with adequate controls and documentation in place. Model users must be trained to ensure they understand the model’s purpose, limitations, and assumptions.\n\n\nModel Monitoring and Performance Evaluation\nOngoing monitoring of model performance, assumptions, and limitations is essential to maintain model accuracy and reliability. Regular model performance evaluations help identify potential issues and trigger model updates or recalibrations when necessary. This stage also includes monitoring regulatory changes that may impact the model’s compliance status.\n\n\nModel Maintenance and Retirement\nModel maintenance involves periodic updates and recalibrations to address changing conditions or identified issues. When a model is no longer relevant or effective, it must be retired and replaced with a more suitable model. Proper documentation and archiving of retired models are essential for regulatory and audit purposes."

Project: Customer Churn Model - Initial Validation (clhdxzbb700020a8hpu126rq0)\n\n\n\n\nFor this simple demonstration, we will use the following bank customer churn dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/kmalit/bank-customer-churn-prediction/data.\nWe will train a sample model and demonstrate the following library functionalities:\n\nLogging information about a dataset\nRunning data quality tests on a dataset\nLogging information about a model\nLogging training metrics for a model\nRunning model evaluation tests\n\n\n\n\nWe will now run the default data quality test plan that will collect the following metadata from a dataset:\n\nField types and descriptions\nDescriptive statistics\nData distribution histograms\nFeature correlations\n\nand will run a collection of data quality tests such as:\n\nClass imbalance\nDuplicates\nHigh cardinality\nMissing values\nSkewness\n\nValidMind evaluates if the data quality metrics are within expected ranges. These thresholds or ranges can be further configured by model validators.\n\n\n\nBefore running the test plan, we must first load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and initialize a ValidMind dataset object:\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"./datasets/bank_customer_churn.csv\")\n\nvm_dataset = vm.init_dataset(\n    dataset=df,\n    target_column=\"Exited\",\n    class_labels={\n        \"0\": \"Did not exit\",\n        \"1\": \"Exited\",\n    }\n)\n\nPandas dataset detected. Initializing VM Dataset instance...\nInferring dataset types...\n\n\n\n\nWe can now initialize the TabularDataset test plan. The primary method of doing this is with the run_test_plan function from the vm module. This function takes in a test plan name (in this case tabular_dataset) and a dataset keyword argument (the vm_dataset object we created earlier):\nvm.run_test_plan(\"tabular_dataset\", dataset=vm_dataset)\n\ntabular_plan = vm.run_test_plan(\"tabular_dataset\", dataset=vm_dataset)\n\n

metric to visualize the stationarity of a given time series dataset by plotting the rolling mean and rolling standard deviation. The rolling mean represents the average of the time series data over a fixed-size sliding window, which helps in identifying trends in the data. The rolling standard deviation measures the variability of the data within the sliding window, showing any changes in volatility over time. By analyzing these plots, users can gain insights into the stationarity of the time series data and determine if any transformations or differencing operations are required before applying time series models.\nMetric       runs_test                  RunsTest                          The runs test is a statistical test used to determine whether a given set\n    of data has runs of positive and negative values that are longer than expected\n    under the null hypothesis of randomness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \nMetric                                  SHAPGlobalImportance              SHAP Global Importance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \nMetric       scatter_plot               ScatterPlot                       Generates a visual analysis of data by plotting a scatter plot matrix for all columns\n    in the dataset.

Since we have trained an XGBoost model with a sklearn-like API, we will use the SKLearnClassifier test plan. This test plan will collect model metadata and metrics, and run a variety of model evaluation tests, according to the modeling objective (binary classification for this example).\nThe following model metadata is collected:\n\nModel framework and architecture (e.g. XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)\nModel task details (e.g. binary classification, regression, etc.)\nModel hyperparameters (e.g. number of trees, max depth, etc.)\n\nThe model metrics that are collected depend on the model type, use case, etc. For example, for a binary classification model, the following metrics could be collected (again, depending on configuration):\n\nAUC\nError rate\nLogloss\nFeature importance\n\nSimilarly, different model evaluation tests are run depending on the model type, use case, etc. For example, for a binary classification model, the following tests could be executed:\n\nSimple training/test overfit test\nTraining/test performance degradation\nBaseline test dataset performance test\n\n\n\nIn order to run our SKLearnClassifier test plan, we need to initialize ValidMind object instances for the trained model and the training and test datasets:\n\nvm_train_ds = vm.init_dataset(\n    dataset=train_df,\n    type=\"generic\",\n    target_column=\"Exited\"\n)\n\nvm_test_ds = vm.init_dataset(\n    dataset=test_df,\n    type=\"generic\",\n    target_column=\"Exited\"\n)\n\nvm_model = vm.init_model(\n    model,\n    train_ds=vm_train_ds,\n    test_ds=vm_test_ds,\n)\n\nPandas dataset detected. Initializing VM Dataset instance...\nInferring dataset types...\nPandas dataset detected. Initializing VM Dataset instance...\nInferring dataset types...\n\n\nWe can now run the SKLearnClassifier test plan:\n\nmodel_plan = vm.run_test_plan(\"binary_classifier\", model=vm_model)\n\n

    "text": "Introduction\n\nExecutive Summary\nBeing able to make accurate and timely estimates of future claims is a fundamental task for actuaries. Questions of profitability, product competitiveness, and insurer solvency depend on understanding future claims, with mortality being one of the central issues facing a life insurer.\nIn this demo, we show an example of a machine learning application on mortality assumption setting, a classic life insurance problem. Using real mortality data collected by the Society of Actuaries, we will walk you through the process of model building and validation.\n\n\nOverview of Mortality Case Study\n\n Case Study Data \nOur dataset is the composite mortality experience data at policy level from 2012 to 2016. This dataset is used to published the 2016 Individual Life Experience Report by SOA’s Individual Life Experience Committee (ILEC).\nFor the case study, the data was restricted to term life insurance policies that were within the initial policy term, issued after 1980, and the issue age was at least 18 years old.\nMore details on this dataset can be found in Section 2 of the data report https://www.soa.org/49957f/globalassets/assets/files/resources/research-report/2021/2016-individual-life-report.pdf\n\n\n Case Study Model \nFor the case study in this paper, we used the statsmodel’s implementation of the GLM family models. Our main model is using Poisson distribution with log link function that is often used for mortality prediction.\nThe  response variable used in this case study is the number of deaths. Policies exposed was used as a weight in the model. We also tried to fit the mortality rate, which is number of deaths/ policies exposed using Gaussian distribution with log link, that can be found in the Appendix\nThe features used in the mortality model are:\n\nAttained Age – the sum of the policyholder’s age at policy issue and the number of years they have held the policy.\nDuration – the number of years (starting with a value of one) the policyholder has had the policy.\nSmoking Status – if the policyholder is considered a smoker or not.\nPreferred Class – an underwriting structure used by insurers to classify and price policyholders. Different companies have different structures with the number of classes ranging from two to four. The lower the class designation, the healthier the policyholders who are put into that class. Thus, someone in class 1 of 3 (displayed as 1_3 in this paper) is considered healthier at time of issue than someone in class 3 of 3.\nGender – A categorical feature in the model with two levels, male and female.\nGuaranteed Term Period – the length of the policy at issue during which the premium will remain constant regardless of policyholder behavior or health status. The shortest term period in the data is five years with increasing lengths by five years up to 30 years. Term period is used as a categorical feature with six levels.\nFace_Amount_Band\nObservation Year\n\n\n\n\n\nSet Up\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport random\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n\nimport sklearn \nfrom sklearn import preprocessing\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\nimport os\nimport xgboost as xgb\n\nFirst, let’s download data directly from the SOA website and unzip.

Goodness of Fit\n\n Pseudo R-squared \nIn linear regression, the squared multiple correlation, R-squared is often used to assess goodness of fit as it represents the proportion of variance in the criterion that is explained by the predictors.\nFor GLM, pseudo R-squared is the most analogous measure to the squared multiple correlations. It represents the proportional reduction in the deviance wherein the deviance is treated as a measure of variation analogous but not identical to the variance in linear regression analysis. Quantifiably, the higher is better.\n\n\\(R_{\\text{L}}^{2}={\\frac {{Deviance}_{\\text{null}}-Deviance_{\\text{fitted}}}{Deviance_{\\text{null}}}}\\)\n\n\nres1.pseudo_rsquared()\n\n\n\n Deviance \nThe (total) deviance for a model M with estimates \\({\\displaystyle {\\hat {\\mu }}=E[Y|{\\hat {\\theta }}_{0}]}\\), based on a dataset y, may be constructed by its likelihood as:\n\n\\({\\displaystyle D(y,{\\hat {\\mu }})=2\\left(\\log \\left[p(y\\mid {\\hat {\\theta }}_{s})\\right]-\\log \\left[p(y\\mid {\\hat {\\theta }}_{0})\\right]\\right)}\\)\n\nHere \\(\\hat \\theta_0\\) denotes the fitted values of the parameters in the model M, while \\(\\hat \\theta_s\\) denotes the fitted parameters for the saturated model: both sets of fitted values are implicitly functions of the observations y.\nIn large samples, deviance follows a chi-square distribution with n−p degrees of freedom, where n is the number of observations and p is the number of parameters in the model. The null hypothesis, H0, is that the model fits. The alternative hypothesis, H1, is that the model does not fit. A deviance much higher than n−p indicates the model is a poor fit to the data. Quantifiably, smaller is always better: The smaller the deviance, the better the fit of the model.\nHere we divided the deviance by the residual degree of freedom and observed a ratio much smaller than 1\n\nres1.deviance/res1.df_resid\n\n\n\n Pearson Statistic and dispersion \nSimilar to deviance test, the Pearson Statistic is approximately chi-square distributed with n – p degrees of freedom. A Pearson Statistic much higher than the degree of freedom indicates that the model is a poor fit.\nAdditionally, for a Poisson distribution, the mean and the variance are equal. In addition to testing goodness-of-fit, the Pearson statistic can also be used as a test of overdispersion. Overdispersion means that the actual covariance matrix for the observed data exceeds that for the specified model for Y|X.\nHere we divided the pearson statistic by the residual degree of freedom and observed a value very close to 1\n\nres1.pearson_chi2/res1.df_resid\n\n\n\n\n2. Feature importance\n\nConfidence intervals and p-values \nConfidence intervals and p-values quantifying the statistical significance of individual predictor variables. Unlike other models like XGBoost, the estimates for statistical significance of individual predictor variables are readily available.\n\nres1.summary()\n\nFrom the summary, we can see that all of the features other than SOA_Anticipated_Level_Term_Period are significant as all p-values are < 5%.\nDirectionally, the coeficients for the main features like Gender, Smoking Status, Attained_Age or Duration are all aligned with our intuition and the EDA charts that we created previously:\n\nMortality rate for Male is higher than Female\nMortality rate for Smoker is higher than non-Smoker\nMortality rate is higher as age is higher\nMortality rate is higher as duration is longer\n\n\n\n\n3. Main Effects\nWe want to understand the individual effects for each feature in the model. In a GLM context, the coefficient value of each feature already made it easy to understand the direction, magnitude, and shape of a feature’s effect on the predicted value. We can take this further by producing the partial dependence plots (PDP) that display partial dependencies of predicted mortality in terms of key covariates. Within each visualization, the projections are averaged over all covariates not included and over all predicted rows to provide an average representation of the full data set given.\n\ndef pdp2(df, x, hue, predict_col = 'death_hat1'):\n    agg = df.groupby([x, hue])['Number_Of_Deaths', predict_col, 'Policies_Exposed'].sum().reset_index()\n    agg['log_mort_predicted'] = (agg[predict_col]/agg['Policies_Exposed']).apply(lambda x: np.log(x))\n    \n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (6,3))\n    sns.lineplot(data = agg, x = x, y = 'log_mort_predicted', hue = hue, ax = ax)\n    plt.xlabel(x)\n    plt.ylabel('log_mort')\n    plt.title(f'Log mortality by {x} and {hue}')\n    plt.show()\n    \npdp2(train_df, 'Attained_Age', 'Gender')\npdp2(train_df, 'Duration', 'Gender')\npdp2(train_df, 'Attained_Age', 'Smoker_Status')\npdp2(train_df, 'Duration', 'Smoker_Status')\npdp2(train_df, 'Attained_Age', 'Preferred_Class')\npdp2(train_df, 'Duration', 'Preferred_Class')\n\nWe can see that the partial dependency plots reconfirms the directional relationships between important covariates and the output that we have discussed in part 2. Feature Importances\nAdditionally, the charts reflect that fact that we have not included any interactions between the covariates. Look at the difference in mortality between smoking and non-smokingm for example, it’s almost constant regardless of ages.\n\n\n4. Interaction Effects\nOne of the key elements in understanding a predictive model is examining its interaction effects. Interaction effects occur when the impact of a change in a variable depends on the values of other features.\nHere we fit a model with all first-order interactions between variables and compare the results against our Vanilla model to evaluate the effect of interactions.\n\n Model 2: Poisson distribution with log link on Death Count with interactions \n\nmodel2 = smf.glm(formula = 'Number_Of_Deaths ~ 1 + C(Observation_Year) + C(Gender) + C(Smoker_Status) + C(Face_Amount_Band) + C(Preferred_Class) +  Attained_Age + Duration\\\n                        + C(Observation_Year) * (C(Gender) + C(Smoker_Status) + C(Face_Amount_Band) + C(Preferred_Class) + Attained_Age + Duration) + C(Gender) * (C(Smoker_Status) + C(Face_Amount_Band) + C(Preferred_Class) + Attained_Age + Duration) + C(Smoker_Status) * (C(Face_Amount_Band) + C(Preferred_Class) + Attained_Age + Duration) + C(Face_Amount_Band) * (C(Preferred_Class) + Attained_Age + Duration) + C(Preferred_Class) * (Attained_Age + Duration) + Attained_Age * Duration',\n                data = train_df,\n                family=sm.families.Poisson(sm.families.links.log()),\n                freq_weights = train_df['Policies_Exposed'],\n                offset = train_df['Policies_Exposed'].apply(lambda x: np.log(x))\n              )\nres2 = model2.fit() #_regularized(method='elastic_net', alpha=0.5)\n\n# append fitted values for training and predicted values for testing\ntrain_df['mort_hat2'] = res2.predict(exog = train_df)\ntrain_df['death_hat2'] = train_df['mort_hat2'] * train_df['Policies_Exposed']\ntest_df['mort_hat2'] = res2.predict(exog = test_df)\ntest_df['death_hat2'] = test_df['mort_hat2'] * test_df['Policies_Exposed']\n\nres2.summary()\n\n\n\n Compared to the vanilla model \nFirst, pearson and deviance are reasonable\n\nprint(f'Pearson_statistics/df = {res2.pearson_chi2/res2.df_resid}')\n\nprint(f'deviance/df = {res2.deviance/res2.df_resid}')\n\nCompared against model 1, we noticed a siginificant reduction on AIC so model 2 has a better fit, but the trade off is a more convoluted set of features.\n\nprint(f'AIC for Model 1 - No interaction: {res1.aic}')\nprint(f'AIC for Model 2 - With interactions: {res2.aic}')\n\nSide note on definition of AIC:  A collection of candidate models can be compared, and the selection criteria may be to choose the model with the highest log-likelihood. However, the log-likelihood of a model will almost always increase with the addition of more variables, even if those variables are insignificant and do little to increase the model’s predictive power. The Akaike information criterion, or AIC, is a penalized log-likelihood formula that charges a penalty for additional variables. It can be thought of as a measure of the relative quality of a model. When considering one or more models fit to the same dataset, the preferred model is the one with the minimum AIC value.\n\n\n\n5. Correlated Features\nFor GLMs and other variations of linear models, correlation, multicollinearity, and aliasing (perfect correlation) among predictor variables can cause standard deviations of coefficients to be large and coefficients to behave erratically, causing issues with interpretability.\nThis is usually assessed by looking at the correlation matrix, which we have seen during the EDA phase. Let’s show it again below. We don’t see severe correlation between any two features that requires dropping one from the feature set.\n\n# we quickly check for any collinearity\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (20,20))\nsns.heatmap(train_df[['Gender_Female','Gender_Male','Smoker_Status_NonSmoker','Smoker_Status_Smoker','Preferred_Class_1.0','Preferred_Class_2.0','Preferred_Class_3.0','Preferred_Class_4.0','Attained_Age', 'Duration', 'Policies_Exposed', 'Const']].corr(), annot=True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nIn this notebook, we walked through the process of building a GLM model for mortality prediction and the important validation exercises to confirm the correctness of the model. - We performed EDA on the ILEC dataset and created a simple GLM model with Poisson distribution and log link and achieved reasonable goodness of fit even with only a handful number of covariates. - We validated and confirmed the soundness of the feature importance and main efferts of important covariates. - We checked for any necessary inclusion of interactions and handling of correlated features.\nApparently, we are still limited by linear combination of covariates at the core of the Poisson GLM model, so certain non-linear dynamics near the two tails of the age distribution are not captured very well. In the Appendix, we show an example of how a more complex model like GBM has the potential to better capture those dynamics.\n\n\nAppendix\n\nModel 1 not using formula\nThis is the explicit setup where we don’t lean on R-like formula to set up the model. The output coefficients are in the same ballpark as model 1 using the formula in the main analysis.\n\n# Target Variable\nY = ['Number_Of_Deaths']\n\n# Predictors (aka Input Variables)\nX = cat_vars_encoded + ['Attained_Age', 'Duration',  'Const'] \n\n# Our choice for Link function is the Gaussian distribution for the nature of death frequency\nmodel = sm.GLM(endog = train_df[Y], \n               exog = train_df[X], \n               family=sm.families.Poisson(sm.families.links.log()),\n               freq_weights = train_df['Policies_Exposed'],\n               offset = train_df['Policies_Exposed'].apply(lambda x: np.log(x))\n              )\nres = model.fit()\nres.summary()\n\n\n\nModel 3: Gaussian distribution with log link on mortality rate\nThis is an experiment where we try to fit a GLM with Gaussian distribution and log link to the mortality rate.

The are only two requirements for getting this to work:\n\nWe need to build a TestPlan that can execute the custom metric or threshold test (or add it to an existing TestPlan, TBD).\nWe need to implement a run method on the custom metric or threshold test class.\n\n\n\nThe following example shows how to implement a custom metric that calculates the mean of a list of numbers.\n\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom validmind.vm_models import Metric\n\n@dataclass\nclass MeanMetric(Metric):\n    type = \"dataset\"\n    key = \"mean_of_values\"\n\n    def run(self):\n        if \"values\" not in self.params:\n            raise ValueError(\"values must be provided in params\")\n\n        if not isinstance(self.params[\"values\"], list):\n            raise ValueError(\"values must be a list\")\n        \n        values = self.params[\"values\"]\n        mean = sum(values) / len(values)\n        return self.cache_results(mean)\n\n\n\n\nIt is possible to run a custom metric without running an entire test plan. This is useful for testing the metric before integrating it into a test plan.\nThe key idea is to create a TestContext object and pass it to the metric initializer. When a test plan is executed, the TestContext is created by the TestPlan class and passed down to every associated metric and threshold test. However, when we want to test a metric in isolation, we need to create the TestContext ourselves.\nIn this example we don’t need to pass any arguments to the TestContext initializer, but it is possible to pass any arguments as required by required_context.\n\nfrom validmind.vm_models.test_context import TestContext\n\ntest_context = TestContext()\nmean_metric = MeanMetric(test_context=test_context, params={\n    \"values\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n})\nmean_metric.run()\n\nTestPlanMetricResult(figures=None, metric=MetricResult(type='dataset', scope='', key='mean_of_values', value=3.0, value_formatter=None))\n\n\nWe can also inspect the results of the metric by accessing the result variable:\n\nmean_metric.result\n\nTestPlanMetricResult(figures=None,

The purpose of this test plan is to evaluate the performance of each model in predicting future values of a time series based on historical data. By comparing the historical values with the forecasted values, users can visually assess the accuracy of each model and determine which one best fits the data. In addition, this test plan can help users identify any discrepancies between the models and the actual data, allowing for potential improvements in model selection and parameter tuning.\n

The process begins by describing a test plan specifically designed for time series data quality. This test plan contains a set of tests that evaluate the quality of the provided time series data.\nNext, the raw DataFrame is used to initialize a dataset using the vm library. This newly created dataset object, vm_dataset, is then utilized for further processing. The test plan parameters are configured to define the z-score threshold for outlier detection and the minimum threshold for identifying missing values.\nFinally, the test plan, time_series_data_quality, is executed using the vm.run_test_plan() function with the initialized dataset and the configuration settings provided. This function applies the specified tests to the dataset and generates a report on the quality of the time series data based on the configured parameters.\n\nvm.test_plans.describe_plan(\"time_series_data_quality\")\n\n\n\n\nAttribute       Value                                                                                                           \n\n\nID              time_series_data_quality                                                                                        \nName            TimeSeriesDataQuality                                                                                           \nDescription     Test plan for data quality on time series datasets                                                              \nRequired Context['dataset']                                                                                                     \nTests           TimeSeriesOutliers (ThresholdTest), TimeSeriesMissingValues (ThresholdTest), TimeSeriesFrequency (ThresholdTest)\nTest Plans      []                                                                                                              \n\n\n\n\n\nvm_dataset = vm.init_dataset(\n    dataset=raw_df\n)\n\nconfig={\n    \"time_series_outliers\": {\n        \"zscore_threshold\": 3,\n\n    },\n    \"time_series_missing_values\":{\n        \"min_threshold\": 2,\n    }\n}\n\nvm.run_test_plan(\"time_series_data_quality\", dataset=vm_dataset, config=config)\n\nPandas dataset detected.

For now, ValidMind supports metrics and tests for a single dataset, so we first will combine the test and train sets into one to get complete datapoints.\n\n## load the train and test dataframes\n# assume that the train and test datasets have been saved to disk as csv files\n# see the r-customer-churn-model.ipynb notebook for details on how this can be done\ndf_train = pd.read_csv(\"r_demo/r_churn_train.csv\")\ndf_test = pd.read_csv(\"r_demo/r_churn_test.csv\")\n\nvm_train_ds = vm.init_dataset(dataset=df_train, type=\"generic\", target_column=\"Exited\")\nvm_test_ds = vm.init_dataset(dataset=df_test, type=\"generic\", target_column=\"Exited\")\n\nPandas dataset detected.

    "text": "This interactive notebook will guide you through documenting a model using the ValidMind Developer framework. We will use sample datasets provided by the library and train a simple classification model.\nFor this simple demonstration, we will use the following bank customer churn dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/kmalit/bank-customer-churn-prediction/data.\nWe will train a sample model and demonstrate the following documentation functionalities:\n\nInitializing the ValidMind Developer Framework\nUsing a sample datasets provided by the library to train a simple classification model\nRunning a test suite to quickly generate document about the data and model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog in to the ValidMind platform with your registered email address, and navigate to the Documentation Projects page.\n\n\n(Note: if a documentation project has already been created, you can skip this section and head directly “Finding Project API key and secret”)\nClicking on “Create a new project” allows to you to register a new documentation project for our demo model.\nSelect “Customer Churn model” from the Model drop-down, and “Initial Validation” as Type. Finally, click on “Create Project”.\n\n\n\nIn the “Client Integration” page of the newly created project, you will find the initialization code that allows the client library to associate documentation and tests with the appropriate project. The initialization code configures the following arguments:\n\napi_host: Location of the ValidMind API.\napi_key: Account API key.\napi_secret: Account Secret key.\nproject: The project identifier. The project argument is mandatory since it allows the library to associate all data collected with a specific account project.\n\nThe code snippet can be copied and pasted directly in the cell below to initialize the ValidMind Developer Framework when run:\n\n## Replace the code below with the code snippet from your project ## \n\nimport validmind as vm\n\nvm.init(\n  api_host = \"https://api.staging.validmind.ai/api/v1/tracking\",\n  api_key = \"e22b89a6b9c2a27da47cb0a09febc001\",\n  api_secret = \"a61be901b5596e3c528d94231e4a3c504ef0bb803d16815f8dfd6857fac03e57\",\n  project = \"cl1jyv16o000809lg98gi9tie\"\n)\n\nConnected to ValidMind. Project: Bank Customer Churn Prediction (cl1jyv16o000809lg98gi9tie)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this demonstration, we will use a sample dataset provided by the ValidMind library.\n\n# Import the sample dataset from the library\nfrom validmind.datasets.classification import customer_churn as demo_dataset\n# You can try a different dataset with: from validmind.datasets.classification import taiwan_credit as demo_dataset\n\ndf = demo_dataset.load_data()\n\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'validmind.datasets.classification'\n\n\n\n\nBefore running the test plan, we must first initialize a ValidMind dataset object using the init_dataset function from the vm module. This function takes in arguements: dataset which is the dataset that we want to analyze; target_column which is used to identify the target variable; class_labels which is used to identify the labels used for classification model training.\n\nvm_dataset = vm.init_dataset(\n    dataset=df,\n    target_column=demo_dataset.target_column,\n    class_labels=demo_dataset.class_labels\n)\n\nPandas dataset detected. Initializing VM Dataset instance...\nInferring dataset types...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will need to preprocess the dataset and produce the training, test and validation splits first.\n\n\nFor demonstration purposes, we simplified the preprocessing using demo_dataset.preprocess which executes the following operations:\n\ntrain_df, validation_df, test_df = demo_dataset.preprocess(df)\n\n\nx_train = train_df.drop(demo_dataset.target_column, axis=1)\ny_train = train_df[demo_dataset.target_column]\nx_val = validation_df.drop(demo_dataset.target_column, axis=1)\ny_val = validation_df[demo_dataset.target_column]\n\nmodel = xgb.XGBClassifier(early_stopping_rounds=10)\nmodel.set_params(\n    eval_metric=[\"error\", \"logloss\", \"auc\"],\n)\nmodel.fit(\n    x_train,\n    y_train,\n    eval_set=[(x_val, y_val)],\n    verbose=False,\n)\n\nWe can now initialize the training and test datasets into dataset objects using vm.init_dataset():\n\nvm_train_ds = vm.init_dataset(\n    dataset=train_df,\n    type=\"generic\",\n    target_column=demo_dataset.target_column\n)\n\nvm_test_ds = vm.init_dataset(\n    dataset=test_df,\n    type=\"generic\",\n    target_column=demo_dataset.target_column\n)\n\nWe also initialize a model object using vm.init_model():\n\n\nvm_model = vm.init_model(\n    model,\n    train_ds=vm_train_ds,\n    test_ds=vm_test_ds,\n)\n\n\n\n\nWe are now ready to run the test suite for binary classifier with tabular datasets. This function will run test plans on the dataset and model objects, and will document the results in the ValidMind UI.\n\nfull_suite = vm.run_test_suite(\n    \"binary_classifier_full_suite\",\n    dataset=vm_dataset,\n    model=vm_model\n)\n\nYou can access and review the resulting documentation in the ValidMind UI, in the “Model Development” section of the model documentation."
