The class signatures below show the different methods that need to be implemented in order to provide the required documentation elements:\n@dataclass\nclass ExampleMetric(Metric):\n    name = \"mean_of_values\"\n\n    # Markdown compatible description of the metric\n    def description(self):\n\n    # Code to compute the metric and cache its results and Figures\n    def run(self):\n\n    # Code to build a list of ResultSummaries that form the results tables\n    def summary(self, metric_values):\nWe’ll now implement a sample metric to illustrate their different documentation components.\n\n\nImplement a custom metric\nThe following example shows how to implement a custom metric that calculates the mean of a list of numbers.\n\nBasic metric implementation\nAt its most basic, a metric implementation requires a run() method that computes the metric and caches its results and Figures. The run() method is called by the ValidMind client when the metric is executed. The run() should return any value that can be serialized to JSON.\nIn the example below we also provide a simple description for the metric:\n\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom validmind.vm_models import Metric\n\n\n@dataclass\nclass MeanMetric(Metric):\n    name = \"mean_of_values\"\n\n    def description(self):\n        return \"Calculates the mean of the provided values\"\n\n    def run(self):\n        if \"values\" not in self.params:\n            raise ValueError(\"values must be provided in params\")\n\n        if not isinstance(self.params[\"values\"], list):\n            raise ValueError(\"values must be a list\")\n\n        values = self.params[\"values\"]\n        mean = sum(values) / len(values)\n\n        return self.cache_results(mean)\n\n\n\nTest the custom metric\nWe should run a metric first without running an entire test suite and test its behavior.\nThe only requirement to run a metric is build a TestContext object and pass it to the metric initializer. Test context objects allow metrics and tests to access data inside their class methods in a predictable way. By default, ValidMind provides support for the following special keys in a test context objects:\n\ndataset\nmodel\nmodels\n\nWhen a test context object is build with one of these keys, the corresponding value is automatically added to the object as an attribute. For example, if you build a test context object with the dataset key, you can access the dataset inside the metric’s run() method as self.dataset. We’ll illustrate this in detail in the next section.\nIn our simple example, we don’t need to pass any arguments to the TestContext initializer.\n\nfrom validmind.vm_models.test_context import TestContext\n\ntest_context = TestContext()\nmean_metric = MeanMetric(test_context=test_context, params={\n    \"values\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n})\nmean_metric.run()\n\nYou can also inspect the results of the metric by accessing the result variable:\n\nmean_metric.result.show()\n\n\n\n\nAdd a summary() method to the custom metric\nThe summary() method is used to build a ResultSummary object that can display the results of our test as a list of one or more summray tables. The ResultSummary class takes a results argument that is a list of ResultTable objects.\nEach ResultTable object is composed of a data and metadata attribute. The data attribute is any valid Pandas tabular DataFrame and metadata is a ResultTableMetadata instance that takes title as the table description.\n\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom validmind.vm_models import Metric, ResultSummary, ResultTable, ResultTableMetadata\n\n\n@dataclass\nclass MeanMetric(Metric):\n    name = \"mean_of_values\"\n\n    def description(self):\n        return \"Calculates the mean of the provided values\"\n\n    def summary(self, metric_value):\n        # Create a dataframe structure that can be rendered as a table\n        simple_df = pd.DataFrame({\"Mean of Values\": [metric_value]})\n\n        return ResultSummary(\n            results=[\n                ResultTable(\n                    data=simple_df,\n                    metadata=ResultTableMetadata(title=\"Example Table\"),\n                ),\n            ]\n        )\n\n    def run(self):\n        if \"values\" not in self.params:\n            raise ValueError(\"values must be provided in params\")\n\n        if not isinstance(self.params[\"values\"], list):\n            raise ValueError(\"values must be a list\")\n\n        values = self.params[\"values\"]\n        mean = sum(values) / len(values)\n        return self.cache_results(mean)\n\n\nfrom validmind.vm_models.test_context import TestContext\n\ntest_context = TestContext()\nmean_metric = MeanMetric(test_context=test_context, params={\n    \"values\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n})\nmean_metric.run()\n\n\nmean_metric.result.show()\n\n\n\nAdd figures to a metric\nYou can also add figures to a metric by passing a figures list to cache_results(). Each figure is a Figure object that takes the following arguments:\n\nfor_object: The name of the object that the figure is for. Usually defaults to self\nfigure: A Matplotlib or Plotly figure object\nkey: A unique key for the figure\n\nThe developer framework uses for_object and key to link figures to the corresponding metric or test.\n\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom validmind.vm_models import Figure, Metric, ResultSummary, ResultTable, ResultTableMetadata\n\n\n@dataclass\nclass MeanMetric(Metric):\n    name = \"mean_of_values\"\n\n    def description(self):\n        return \"Calculates the mean of the provided values\"\n\n    def summary(self, metric_value):\n        # Create a dataframe structure that can be rendered as a table\n        simple_df = pd.DataFrame({\"Mean of Values\": [metric_value]})\n\n        return ResultSummary(\n            results=[\n                ResultTable(\n                    data=simple_df,\n                    metadata=ResultTableMetadata(title=\"Example Table\"),\n                ),\n            ]\n        )\n\n    def run(self):\n        if \"values\" not in self.params:\n            raise ValueError(\"values must be provided in params\")\n\n        if not isinstance(self.params[\"values\"], list):\n            raise ValueError(\"values must be a list\")\n\n        values = self.params[\"values\"]\n        mean = sum(values) / len(values)\n\n        # Create a random histogram with matplotlib\n        fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n        ax.hist(np.random.randn(1000), bins=20, color=\"blue\")\n        ax.set_title(\"Histogram of random numbers\")\n        ax.set_xlabel(\"Value\")\n        ax.set_ylabel(\"Frequency\")\n\n        # Do this if you want to prevent the figure from being displayed\n        plt.close(\"all\")\n\n        figure = Figure(\n            for_object=self,\n            key=self.key,\n            figure=fig\n        )\n\n        return self.cache_results(mean, figures=[figure])\n\n\nfrom validmind.vm_models.test_context import TestContext\n\ntest_context = TestContext()\nmean_metric = MeanMetric(test_context=test_context, params={\n    \"values\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n})\nmean_metric.run()\n\n\nmean_metric.result.show()\n\n\nfrom validmind.vm_models import TestPlan\n\n\nclass MyCustomTestPlan(TestPlan):\n    \"\"\"\n    Custom test suite\n    \"\"\"\n\n    name = \"my_custom_test_suite\"\n    required_inputs = []\n    tests = [MeanMetric]\n\n\nmy_custom_test_suite = MyCustomTestPlan(config={\n    \"mean_of_values\": {\n        \"values\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n    },\n})\nresults = my_custom_test_suite.run()"

ValidMind’s developer framework exposes these parameters at the user level so that they can be adjusted based on requirements.\nThe config can be applied to a specific test to override the default configuration parameters.\nThe format of the config is:\nconfig = {\n    \"&lt;test1_id&gt;\": {\n        \"&lt;default_param_1&gt;\": value,\n        \"&lt;default_param_2&gt;\": value,\n    },\n     \"&lt;test2_id&gt;\": {\n        \"&lt;default_param_1&gt;\": value,\n        \"&lt;default_param_2&gt;\": value,\n    },\n}\nUsers can input the configuration to run_documentation_tests() and run_test_suite() using config, allowing fine-tuning the suite according to the specific configuration requirements.\n\nconfig = {\n    \"validmind.model_validation.sklearn.OverfitDiagnosis\": {\n        \"cut_off_percentage\": 3,\n        \"feature_columns\": [\"Age\", \"Balance\", \"Tenure\", \"NumOfProducts\"]\n    },\n    \"validmind.model_validation.sklearn.WeakspotsDiagnosis\": {\n        \"features_columns\": [\"Age\", \"Balance\"],\n        \"accuracy_gap_threshold\": 85,\n    },\n    \"validmind.model_validation.sklearn.RobustnessDiagnosis\": {\n        \"features_columns\": [\"Balance\", \"Tenure\"],\n        \"scaling_factor_std_dev_list\": [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5],\n        \"accuracy_decay_threshold\": 4,\n    }\n}\n\nfull_suite = vm.run_documentation_tests(\n    dataset=vm_dataset,\n    model=vm_model,\n    section=\"model_diagnosis\",\n    config=config,\n)\n\n\n\n\nNext steps\nYou can look at the results of this test plan right in the notebook where you ran the code, as you would expect.

This algorithm assumes that anomalous data points can be isolated more quickly due to their distinctive properties. By creating isolation trees and identifying instances with shorter average path lengths, the test is able to pick out data points that differ from the majority.\nTest Mechanism: The test uses the isolation forest algorithm, which builds an ensemble of isolation trees by randomly selecting features and splitting the data based on random thresholds. It isolates anomalies rather than focusing on normal data points. For each pair of variables, a scatter plot is generated which distinguishes the identified outliers from the inliers. The results of the test can be visualized using these scatter plots, illustrating the distinction between outliers and inliers.\nSigns of High Risk: - The presence of high contamination, indicating a large number of anomalies - Inability to detect clusters of anomalies that are close in the feature space - Misclassifying normal instances as anomalies - Failure to detect actual anomalies\nStrengths: - Ability to handle large, high-dimensional datasets - Efficiency in isolating anomalies instead of normal instances - Insensitivity to the underlying distribution of data - Ability to recognize anomalies even when they are not separated from the main data cloud through identifying distinctive properties - Visually presents the test results for better understanding and interpretability\nLimitations: - Difficult to detect anomalies that are close to each other or prevalent in datasets - Dependency on the contamination parameter which may need fine-tuning to be effective - Potential failure in detecting collective anomalies if they behave similarly to normal data - Potential lack of precision in identifying which features contribute most to the anomalous behavior"

In this context, high cardinality implies the presence of a large number of unique, non-repetitive values in the dataset.\nTest Mechanism: The test first infers the dataset’s type and then calculates an initial numeric threshold based on the test parameters. It only considers columns classified as “Categorical”. For each of these columns, the number of distinct values (n_distinct) and the percentage of distinct values (p_distinct) are calculated. The test will pass if n_distinct is less than the calculated numeric threshold. Lastly, the results, which include details such as column name, number of distinct values, and pass/fail status, are compiled into a table.\nSigns of High Risk: - A large number of distinct values (high cardinality) in one or more categorical columns implies a high risk. - A column failing the test (n_distinct &gt;= num_threshold) is another indicator of high risk.\nStrengths: - The High Cardinality test is effective in early detection of potential overfitting and unwanted noise. - It aids in identifying potential outliers and inconsistencies, thereby improving data quality. - The test can be applied to both, classification and regression task types, demonstrating its versatility.\nLimitations: - The test is restricted to only “Categorical” data types and is thus not suitable for numerical or continuous features, limiting its scope. - The test does not consider the relevance or importance of unique values in categorical features, potentially causing it to overlook critical data points. - The threshold (both number and percent) used for the test is static and may not be optimal for diverse datasets and varied applications. Further mechanisms to adjust and refine this threshold could enhance its effectiveness."

This information is essential in evaluating the functionality of credit risk models, by providing a comprehensive view of default rates across a range of risk categories.\nTest Mechanism: The applied test approach involves a calculated bar plot. This plot is derived by initially determining the count of accounts in every risk band and then converting these count values into percentages by dividing by the total quantity of accounts. The percentages are then depicted as a bar plot, clearly showcasing the proportion of total accounts associated with each risk band. Hence, the plot delivers a summarized depiction of default risk across various bands. The ‘Dark24’ color sequence is used in the plot to ensure each risk band is easily distinguishable.\nSigns of High Risk: - High risk may be indicated by a significantly large percentage of accounts associated with high-risk bands. - High exposure to potential default risk in the dataset indicates potential weaknesses in the model’s capability to effectively manage or predict credit risk.\nStrengths: - The metric’s primary strengths lie in its simplicity and visual impact. - The graphical display of default rates allows for a clear understanding of the spread of default risk across risk bands. - Using a bar chart simplifies the comparison between various risk bands and can highlight potential spots of high risk. - This approach assists in identifying any numerical imbalances or anomalies, thus facilitating the task of evaluating and contrasting performance across various credit risk models.\nLimitations: - The key constraint of this metric is that it cannot provide any insights as to why certain risk bands might have higher default rates than others. - If there is a large imbalance in the number of accounts across risk bands, the visual representation might not accurately depict the true distribution of risk. - Other factors contributing to credit risk beyond the risk bands are not considered. - The metric’s reliance on a visual format might potentially lead to misinterpretation of results, as graphical depictions can sometimes be misleading."

The model’s performance is evaluated using bar plots depicting the ratio of target rates—meaning the proportion of positive classes—for different categorical inputs. This allows for an easy, at-a-glance understanding of the model’s accuracy.\nTest Mechanism: The test involves creating a pair of bar plots for each categorical feature in the dataset. The first plot depicts the frequency of each category in the dataset, with each category visually distinguished by its unique color. The second plot shows the mean target rate of each category (sourced from the “default_column”). Plotly, a Python library, is used to generate these plots, with distinct plots created for each feature. If no specific columns are selected, the test will generate plots for each categorical column in the dataset.\nSigns of High Risk: - Inconsistent or non-binary values in the “default_column” could complicate or render impossible the calculation of average target rates. - Particularly low or high target rates for a specific category might suggest that the model is misclassifying instances of that category.\nStrengths: - This test offers a visually interpretable breakdown of the model’s decisions, providing an easy way to spot irregularities, inconsistencies, or patterns. - Its flexibility allows for the inspection of one or multiple columns, as needed.\nLimitations: - The test is less useful when dealing with numeric or continuous data, as it’s designed specifically for categorical features. - If the model in question is dealing with a multi-class problem rather than binary classification, the test’s assumption of binary target values (0s and 1s) becomes a significant limitation. - The readability of the bar plots drops as the number of distinct categories increases in the dataset, which can make them harder to understand and less useful."

It provides the Pearson Correlation coefficient, which reveals any high correlations present. The purpose of doing this is to identify potential redundancy, as variables that are highly correlated can often be removed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset without significantly impacting the model’s performance.\nTest Mechanism: This metric test generates a correlation matrix for all numerical variables in the dataset using the Pearson correlation formula. A heat map is subsequently created to visualize this matrix effectively. The color of each point on the heat map corresponds to the magnitude and direction (positive or negative) of the correlation, with a range from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation). Any correlation coefficients higher than 0.7 (in absolute terms) are indicated in white in the heat map, suggesting a high degree of correlation.\nSigns of High Risk: - A large number of variables in the dataset showing a high degree of correlation (coefficients approaching ±1). This indicates redundancy within the dataset, suggesting that some variables may not be contributing new information to the model. - This could potentially lead to overfitting.\nStrengths: - The primary strength of this metric test is its ability to detect and quantify the linearity of relationships between variables. This allows for the identification of redundant variables, which in turn can help in simplifying models and potentially improving their performance. - The visualization aspect (heatmap) is another strength as it offers an easy-to-understand overview of the correlations, beneficial for those not comfortable navigating numerical matrices.\nLimitations: - The primary limitation of Pearson Correlation is its inability to detect non-linear relationships between variables, which can lead to missed opportunities for dimensionality reduction. - It only measures the degree of linear relationship and not the strength of effect of one variable on the other. - The cutoff value of 0.7 for high correlation is a somewhat arbitrary choice and some valid dependencies might be missed if they have a correlation coefficient less than this value."

The aim is to detect situations where these may implicate data sparsity or a lack of variation, limiting their effectiveness within a machine learning model. The definition of ‘too many’ is quantified as a percentage of total values, with a default set to 3%.\nTest Mechanism: This test is conducted by looping through each column in the dataset and categorizing those that pertain to numerical data. On identifying a numerical column, the function computes the total quantity of zero values and their ratio to the total row count. Should the proportion exceed a pre-set threshold parameter, set by default at 0.03 or 3%, the column is considered to have failed the test. The results for each column are summarised and reported, indicating the count and percentage of zero values for each numerical column, alongside a status indicating whether the column has passed or failed the test.\nSigns of High Risk: - Indicators evidencing a high risk connected with this test would include numerical columns showing a high ratio of zero values when compared to the total count of rows (exceeding a pre-determined threshold). - Columns characterized by zero values across the board suggest a complete lack of data variation, signifying high risk.\nStrengths: - Assists in highlighting columns featuring an excess of zero values that could otherwise go unnoticed within a large dataset. - Provides the flexibility to alter the threshold that determines when the quantity of zero values becomes ‘too many’, thus catering to specific needs of a particular analysis or model. - Offers feedback in the form of both counts and percentages of zero values, which allows a closer inspection of the distribution and proportion of zeros within a column. - Targets specifically numerical data, thereby avoiding inappropriate application to non-numerical columns and mitigating the risk of false test failures.\nLimitations: - Is exclusively designed to check for zero values, and doesn’t assesses the potential impact of other values that could affect the dataset, such as extremely high or low figures, missing values or outliers. - Lacks the ability to detect a repetitive pattern of zeros, which could be significant in time-series or longitudinal data. - Zero values can actually be meaningful in some contexts, therefore tagging them as ‘too many’ could potentially misinterpret the data to some extent. - This test does not take into consideration the context of the dataset, and fails to recognize that within certain columns, a high number of zero values could be quite normal and not necessarily an indicator of poor data quality. - Cannot evaluate non-numerical or categorical columns, which might bring with them different types of concerns or issues."

    "text": "AutoMA\nAutomatically selects the optimal Moving Average (MA) order for each variable in a time series dataset based on minimal BIC and AIC values.\nPurpose: The AutoMA metric serves an essential role of automated decision-making for selecting the optimal Moving Average (MA) order for every variable in a given time series dataset. The selection is dependent on the minimalization of BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) and AIC (Akaike Information Criterion); these are established statistical tools used for model selection. Furthermore, prior to the commencement of the model fitting process, the algorithm conducts a stationarity test (Augmented Dickey-Fuller test) on each series.\nTest Mechanism: Starting off, the AutoMA algorithm checks whether the max_ma_order parameter has been provided. It consequently loops through all variables in the dataset, carrying out the Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity. For each stationary variable, it fits an ARIMA model for orders running from 0 to max_ma_order. The result is a list showcasing the BIC and AIC values of the ARIMA models based on different orders. The MA order, which yields the smallest BIC, is chosen as the ‘best MA order’ for every single variable. The final results include a table summarizing the auto MA analysis and another table listing the best MA order for each variable.\nSigns of High Risk: - When a series is non-stationary (p-value&gt;0.05 in the Dickey-Fuller test), the produced result could be inaccurate. - Any error that arises in the process of fitting the ARIMA models, especially with a higher MA order, can potentially indicate risks and might need further investigation.\nStrengths: - The metric facilitates automation in the process of selecting the MA order for time series forecasting. This significantly saves time and reduces efforts conventionally necessary for manual hyperparameter tuning. - The use of both BIC and AIC enhances the likelihood of selecting the most suitable model. - The metric ascertains the stationarity of the series prior to model fitting, thus ensuring that the underlying assumptions of the MA model are fulfilled.\nLimitations: - If the time series fails to be stationary, the metric may yield inaccurate results. Consequently, it necessitates pre-processing steps to stabilize the series before fitting the ARIMA model. - The metric adopts a rudimentary model selection process based on BIC and doesn’t consider other potential model selection strategies. Depending on the specific dataset, other strategies could be more appropriate. - The ‘max_ma_order’ parameter must be manually input which doesn’t always guarantee optimal performance, especially when configured too low. - The computation time increases with the rise in max_ma_order, hence, the metric may become computationally costly for larger values."

    "text": "MissingValuesBarPlot\nCreates a bar plot showcasing the percentage of missing values in each column of the dataset with risk categorization based on a user-defined threshold.\nPurpose: The ‘MissingValuesBarPlot’ metric provides a color-coded visual representation of the percentage of missing values for each column in an ML model’s dataset. The primary purpose of this metric is to easily identify and quantify missing data, which are essential steps in data preprocessing. The presence of missing data can potentially skew the model’s predictions and decrease its accuracy. Additionally, this metric uses a pre-set threshold to categorize various columns into ones that contain missing data above the threshold (high risk) and below the threshold (less risky).\nTest Mechanism: The test mechanism involves scanning each column in the input dataset and calculating the percentage of missing values. It then compares each column’s missing data percentage with the predefined threshold, categorizing columns with missing data above the threshold as high-risk. The test generates a bar plot in which columns with missing data are represented on the y-axis and their corresponding missing data percentages are displayed on the x-axis. The color of each bar reflects the missing data percentage in relation to the threshold: grey for values below the threshold and light coral for those exceeding it. The user-defined threshold is represented by a red dashed line on the plot.\nSigns of High Risk:\n\nColumns with higher percentages of missing values beyond the threshold are high-risk. These are visually represented by light coral bars on the bar plot.\n\nStrengths:\n\nHelps in quickly identifying and quantifying missing data across all columns of the dataset.\nFacilitates pattern recognition through visual representation.\nEnables customization of the level of risk tolerance via a user-defined threshold.\nSupports both classification and regression tasks, sharing its versatility.\n\nLimitations:\n\nIt only considers the quantity of missing values, not differentiating between different types of missingness (Missing completely at random - MCAR, Missing at random - MAR, Not Missing at random - NMAR).\nIt doesn’t offer insights into potential approaches for handling missing entries, such as various imputation strategies.\nThe metric does not consider possible impacts of the missing data on the model’s accuracy or precision.\nInterpretation of the findings and the next steps might require an expert understanding of the field."

This provides insights into the prevalent language patterns and vocabulary, especially useful in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as text classification and text summarization.\nTest Mechanism: The test methodology involves splitting the specified text column’s entries into words, collating them into a corpus, and then counting the frequency of each word using the Counter. The forty most frequently occurring non-stopwords are then visualized in a bar chart, where the x-axis represents the words, and the y-axis indicates their frequency of occurrence.\nSigns of High Risk: - A lack of distinct words within the list, or the most common words being stopwords. - Frequent occurrence of irrelevant or inappropriate words could point out a poorly curated or noisy dataset. - An error returned due to the absence of a valid Dataset object indicates high risk as the metric cannot be effectively implemented without it.\nStrengths: - The metric provides clear insights into the language features – specifically word frequency – of unstructured text data. - It can reveal prominent vocabulary and language patterns, which prove vital for feature extraction in NLP tasks. - The visualization helps in quickly capturing the patterns and understanding the data intuitively.\nLimitations: - The test disregards semantic or context-related information as it solely focuses on word frequency. - It intentionally ignores stopwords which might carry necessary significance in certain scenarios. - The applicability is limited to English language text data as English stopwords are used for filtering, hence cannot account for data in other languages. - The metric requires a valid Dataset object, indicating a dependency condition that limits its broader applicability."

This metric aids in comprehending the nature of the text and evaluating the potential challenges that machine learning algorithms deployed for textual analysis, language processing, or summarization might face.\nTest Mechanism: The test works by parsing the given dataset and utilizes the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library for tokenizing the text into words, sentences, and paragraphs. Subsequently, it processes the text further by eliminating stopwords declared in ‘unwanted_tokens’ and punctuations. Next, it determines parameters like the total count of words, sentences, paragraphs, punctuations alongside the average sentence length and lexical diversity. Lastly, the result from these calculations is condensed and scatter plots for certain variable combinations (e.g. Total Words vs Total Sentences, Total Words vs Total Unique Words) are produced, providing a visual representation of the text’s structure.\nSigns of High Risk: - Anomalies or an increase in complexity within the lexical diversity results. - Longer sentences and paragraphs. - High uniqueness of words. - Presence of a significant amount of unwanted tokens. - Missing or erroneous visualizations. These signs suggest potential risk in text processing ML models, indicating that the ability of the model to absorb and process text could be compromised.\nStrengths: - An essential pre-processing tool, specifically for textual analysis in machine learning model data. - Provides a comprehensive breakdown of a text dataset, which aids in understanding both structural and vocabulary complexity. - Generates visualizations of correlations between chosen variables to further comprehend the text’s structure and complexity.\nLimitations: - Heavy reliance on the NLTK library, restricting its use to only the languages that NLTK supports. - Limited customization capacity as the undesirable tokens and stop words are predefined. - Lacks the ability to consider semantics or grammatical complexities, which could be crucial aspects in language processing. - Assumes that the document is well-structured (includes sentences and paragraphs); therefore, unstructured or poorly formatted text may distort the results."

It focuses on the identification and analysis of “stop words” in a given dataset. Stop words are frequent, common, yet semantically insignificant words (for example: “the”, “and”, “is”) in a language. This test evaluates the proportion of stop words to the total word count in the dataset, in essence, scrutinizing the frequency of stop word usage. The core objective is to highlight the prevalent stop words based on their usage frequency, which can be instrumental in cleaning the data from noise and improving ML model performance.\nTest Mechanism: The StopWords test initiates on receiving an input of a ‘VMDataset’ object. Absence of such an object will trigger an error. The methodology involves inspection of the text column of the VMDataset to create a corpus’ (a collection of written texts). Leveraging the Natural Language Toolkit’s (NLTK) stop word repository, the test screens the corpus for any stop words and documents their frequency. It further calculates the percentage usage of each stop word compared to the total word count in the corpus. This percentage is evaluated against a predefined ‘min_percent_threshold’. If this threshold is breached, the test returns a failed output. Top prevailing stop words along with their usage percentages are returned, facilitated by a bar chart visualization of these stop words and their frequency.\nSigns of High Risk: - A percentage of any stop words exceeding the predefined ‘min_percent_threshold’. - High frequency of stop words in the dataset which may adversely affect the application’s analytical performance due to noise creation.\nStrengths: - The ability to scrutinize and quantify the usage of stop words. - Provides insights into potential noise in the text data due to stop words. This can directly aid in enhancing model training efficiency. - The test includes a bar chart visualization feature to easily interpret and action upon the stop words frequency information.\nLimitations: - The test only supports English stop words, making it less effective with datasets of other languages. - The ‘min_percent_threshold’ parameter may require fine-tuning for different datasets, impacting the overall effectiveness of the test. - Contextual use of the stop words within the dataset is not considered which may lead to overlooking their significance in certain contexts. - The test focuses specifically on the frequency of stop words, not providing direct measures of model performance or predictive accuracy."

It measures two specific risks: the percentage of total data that are missing, and the percentage of all variables (columns) that contain some missing values.\nTest Mechanism: Initially, the metric calculates the total number of data points in the dataset and the count of missing values. It then inspects each variable (column) to determine how many contain at least one missing datapoint. By methodically counting missing datapoints across the entire dataset and each variable (column), it identifies the percentage of missing values in the entire dataset and the percentage of variables (columns) with such values.\nSigns of High Risk:\n\nRecord high percentages in either of the risk measures could suggest a high risk.\nIf the dataset indicates a high percentage of missing values, it might significantly undermine the model’s performance and credibility.\nIf a significant portion of variables (columns) in the dataset are missing values, this could make the model susceptible to bias and overfitting.\n\nStrengths:\n\nThe metric offers valuable insights into the readiness of a dataset for model training as missing values can heavily destabilize both the model’s performance and predictive capabilities.\nThe metric’s quantification of the risks caused by missing values allows for the use of targeted methods to manage these values correctly- either through removal, imputation, or alternative strategies.\nThe metric has the flexibility to be applied to both classification and regression assignments, maintaining its utility across a wide range of models and scenarios.\n\nLimitations:\n\nThe metric primarily identifies and quantifies the risk associated with missing values without suggesting specific mitigation strategies.\nThe metric does not ascertain whether the missing values are random or associated with an underlying issue in the stages of data collection or preprocessing.\nHowever, the identification of the presence and scale of missing data is the essential initial step towards improving data quality."

This form of bivariate plotting is immensely beneficial in uncovering trends, correlations, patterns, or inconsistencies that may not be readily apparent within raw tabular data.\nTest Mechanism: These tests establish bar plots for each pair of features defined within the parameters. The dataset is grouped by each feature pair and then calculates the mean of the target variable within each specific grouping. Each group is represented via a bar in the plot, and the height of this bar aligns with the calculated mean. The colors assigned to these bars are based on the categorical section to which they pertain: these colors can either come from a colormap or generated anew if the total number of categories exceeds the current colormap’s scope.\nSigns of High Risk: - If any values are found missing or inconsistent within the feature pairs. - If there exist large discrepancies or irregularities between the mean values of certain categories within feature pairs. - If the parameters for feature pairs have not been specified or if they were wrongly defined.\nStrengths: - The BivariateFeaturesBarPlots provides a clear, visual comprehension of the relationships between feature pairs and the target variable. - It allows an easy comparison between different categories within feature pairs. - The metric can handle a diverse array of categorical data, enhancing its universal applicability. - It is highly customizable due to its allowance for users to define feature pairs based on their specific requirements.\nLimitations: - It can only be used with categorical data, limiting its usability with numerical or textual data. - It relies on manual input for feature pairs, which could result in the overlooking of important feature pairs if not chosen judiciously. - The generated bar plots could become overly cluttered and difficult to decipher when dealing with feature pairs with a large number of categories. - This metric only provides a visual evaluation and fails to offer any numerical or statistical measures to quantify the relationship between feature pairs."

If no categorical columns are found, the tool raises a ValueError. For each categorical variable in the dataset, a separate bar plot is generated. The number of occurrences for each category is calculated and displayed on the plot.

The goal is to visualize the overall distribution of the variables in the dataset, aiding in understanding the model’s behavior and predicting its performance.\nTest Mechanism: The testing mechanism utilizes two in-built functions of pandas dataframes: describe() for numerical fields and value_counts() for categorical fields. The describe() function pulls out several summary statistics, while value_counts() accounts for unique values. The resulting data is formatted into two distinct tables, one for numerical and another for categorical variable summaries.

It’s vital for ensuring data quality before modeling, as outliers can skew predictive models and significantly impact their overall performance.\nTest Mechanism: The test processes a given dataset which must have datetime indexing, checks if a zscore_threshold’ parameter has been supplied, and identifies columns with numeric data types. After finding numeric columns, the implementer then applies the z-score method to each numeric column, identifying outliers based on the threshold provided. Each outlier is listed together with their variable name, z-score, timestamp and relative threshold in a dictionary and converted to a DataFrame for convenient output. Additionally, it produces visual plots for each time series illustrating outliers in the context of the broader dataset. The zscore_threshold’ parameter sets the limit beyond which a data point will be labeled as an outlier. The default threshold is set at 3, indicating that any data point that falls 3 standard deviations away from the mean will be marked as an outlier.\nSigns of High Risk: - If many or substantial outliers are present within a dataset, this may be an indicator of high risk as it suggests that the dataset contains significant anomalies. - This could potentially affect the performance of the machine learning models, if not properly addressed. - Data points with z-scores higher than the set threshold would be flagged as outliers and could be considered as high risk.\nStrengths: - The z-score method is a popular and robust method for identifying outliers in a dataset. - Time series maintenance is simplified through requiring a datetime index. - Outliers are identified for each numeric feature individually. - Provides an elaborate report which shows variables, date, z-score and whether the test passed or failed. - Offers visual inspection for detected outliers in the respective time-series through plots.\nLimitations: - This test only identifies outliers in numeric columns, and won’t identify outliers in categorical variables. - The utility and accuracy of z-scores can be limited if the data doesn’t follow a normal distribution. - The method relies on a subjective z-score threshold for deciding what constitutes an outlier, which might not always be suitable depending on the dataset and the use case. - It does not address possible ways to handle identified outliers in the data. - The necessity for a datetime index could limit the extent of its application."

Consequently, this test aims to ensure data quality and readiness for the machine learning model, safeguarding its predictive capacity.\nTest Mechanism: The test method commences by validating if the dataset has a datetime index, if not, an error is raised.

An object for the test result is created stating whether the number of missing values is within the specified threshold.

The test results, a count of missing values, the percentage of missing values, and a pass/fail status are returned in a results table.\nSigns of High Risk: - The number of missing values in any column of the dataset surpasses the threshold, marking a failure and a high-risk scenario. The reasons could range from incomplete data collection, faulty sensors to data preprocessing errors. - A continuous visual ‘streak’ in the heatmap may indicate a systematic error during data collection, pointing towards another potential risk source.\nStrengths: - Effectively identifies missing values which could adversely affect the model’s performance. - Applicable and customizable through the threshold parameter across different data sets. - Goes beyond raw numbers by calculating the percentage of missing values, offering a more relative understanding of data scarcity. - Includes a robust visualization mechanism for easy and fast understanding of data quality.\nLimitations: - Although it identifies missing values, the test does not provide solutions to handle them. - The test demands that the dataset should have a datetime index, hence limiting its use only to time series analysis. - The test’s sensitivity to the ‘min_threshold’ parameter may raise false alarms if set too strictly or may overlook problematic data if set too loosely. - Solely focuses on the ‘missingness’ of the data and might fall short in addressing other aspects of data quality."

It’s crucial to have a balanced training dataset to avoid creating a model that’s biased with high accuracy for the majority class and low accuracy for the minority class.\nTest Mechanism: This ClassImbalance test operates by calculating the frequency (expressed as a percentage) of each class in the target column of the dataset.

This method is iterated for each unique pair of variables in the dataset.\nSigns of High Risk: Potential indicators of high risk related to the SpreadPlot metric might include:\n\nLarge fluctuations in the spread over a given timespan\nUnexpected patterns or trends that may signal a potential risk in the underlying correlations between the variables\nPresence of significant missing data or extreme outlier values, which could potentially skew the spread and indicate high risk\n\nStrengths: The SpreadPlot metric provides several key advantages:\n\nIt allows for thorough visual examination and interpretation of the correlations between time-series pairs\nIt aids in revealing complex relationships like cointegration\nIt enhances interpretability by visualising the relationships, thereby helping in spotting outliers and trends\nIt is capable of handling numerous variable pairs from the dataset through a versatile and adaptable process\n\nLimitations: Despite its advantages, the SpreadPlot metric does have certain drawbacks:\n\nIt primarily serves as a visualisation tool and does not offer quantitative measurements or statistics to objectively determine relationships\nIt heavily relies on the quality and granularity of the data - missing data or outliers can notably disturb the interpretation of the relationships\nIt can become inefficient or difficult to interpret with a high number of variables due to the profuse number of plots\nIt might not completely capture intricate non-linear relationships between the variables"

It illuminates the correlation of the data over time by plotting the correlation of the series with its own lags (ACF), and the correlations after removing effects already accounted for by earlier lags (PACF). This information can identify trends, such as seasonality, degrees of autocorrelation, and inform the selection of order parameters for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models.\nTest Mechanism: The ACFandPACFPlot test accepts a dataset with a time-based index. It first confirms the index is of a datetime type, then handles any NaN values. The test subsequently generates ACF and PACF plots for each column in the dataset, producing a subplot for each. If the dataset doesn’t include key columns, an error is returned.\nSigns of High Risk:\n\nSudden drops in the correlation at a specific lag might signal a model at high risk.\nConsistent high correlation across multiple lags could also indicate non-stationarity in the data, which may suggest that a model estimated on this data won’t generalize well to future, unknown data.\n\nStrengths:\n\nACF and PACF plots offer clear graphical representations of the correlations in time series data.\nThese plots are effective at revealing important data characteristics such as seasonality, trends, and correlation patterns.\nThe insights from these plots aid in better model configuration, particularly in the selection of ARIMA model parameters.\n\nLimitations:\n\nACF and PACF plots are exclusively for time series data and hence, can’t be applied to all ML models.\nThese plots require large, consistent datasets as gaps could lead to misleading results.\nThe plots can only represent linear correlations and fail to capture any non-linear relationships within the data.\nThe plots might be difficult for non-experts to interpret and should not replace more advanced analyses."

This is particularly useful in enhancing the accuracy of predictive regressions whenever the underlying variables are co-integrated, i.e., they move together over time.\nTest Mechanism: The test first drops any non-applicable values from the input dataset and then iterates over each pair of variables to apply the Engle-Granger cointegration test. The test generates a ‘p’ value, which is then compared against a pre-specified threshold (0.05 by default). The pair is labeled as ‘Cointegrated’ if the ‘p value is less than or equal to the threshold or ’Not cointegrated’ otherwise. A summary table is returned by the metric showing cointegration results for each variable pair.\nSigns of High Risk: - A high risk might be indicated if a significant number of variables that were hypothesized to be cointegrated do not pass the test. - Another sign of high risk is if a considerable number of ‘p’ values are close to the threshold. This is a risk because minor fluctuations in the data can switch the decision between ‘Cointegrated’ and ‘Not cointegrated’.\nStrengths: - The Engle-Granger cointegration test provides an effective way to analyze relationships between time series, particularly in contexts where it’s essential to check if variables are moving together in a statistically significant manner. - It is useful in various domains, especially finance or economics. Here, predictive models often hinge on understanding how different variables move together over time.\nLimitations: - The Engle-Granger cointegration test assumes that the time series are integrated of the same order, which isn’t always true in multivariate time series datasets. - The presence of non-stationary characteristics in the series or structural breaks can result in falsely positive or negative cointegration results. - The test may not perform well for small sample sizes due to lack of statistical power.

Subsequently, a feature-by-feature KS statistic and p-value are stored in a dictionary. The specific threshold p-value (the value below which we reject the hypothesis that the data is drawn from a normal distribution) is not firmly set within this implementation, allowing for definitional flexibility depending on the specific application.\nSigns of High Risk: - Elevated KS statistic for a feature combined with a low p-value.

These intervals provide a range wherein the true value can be expected to fall 95% of the time if the same regression were re-run multiple times with samples drawn from the same population. This information is then visualized as a bar plot, with the predictor variables and their coefficients on the x-axis and y-axis respectively and the confidence intervals represented as error bars.\nSigns of High Risk: * If the calculated confidence interval contains the zero value, it could mean the feature/coefficient in question doesn’t significantly contribute to prediction in the model. * If there are multiple coefficients exhibiting this behavior, it might raise concerns about overall model reliability. * Very wide confidence intervals might indicate high uncertainty in the associated coefficient estimates.\nStrengths: * This metric offers a simple and easily comprehendible visualization of the significance and impact of individual predictor variables in a regression model. * By including confidence intervals, it enables an observer to evaluate the uncertainty around each coefficient estimate.\nLimitations: * The test is dependent on a few assumptions about the data, namely normality of residuals and independence of observations, which may not always be true for all types of datasets. * The test does not consider multi-collinearity (correlation among predictor variables), which can potentially distort the model and make interpretation of coefficients challenging. * The test’s application is limited to regression tasks and tabular datasets and is not suitable for other types of machine learning assignments or data structures."

It’s not solely intended to measure the model’s performance but also provides a visual assessment of the model’s behavior by plotting the cumulative probabilities for positive and negative classes across both the training and test datasets.\nTest Mechanism: The logistic regression model is evaluated by first computing the predicted probabilities for each instance in both the training and test datasets, which are then added as a new column in these sets. The cumulative probabilities for positive and negative classes are subsequently calculated and sorted in ascending order. Cumulative distributions of these probabilities are created for both positive and negative classes across both training and test datasets. These cumulative probabilities are represented visually in a plot, containing two subplots - one for the training data and the other for the test data, with lines representing cumulative distributions of positive and negative classes.\nSigns of High Risk: - Imbalanced distribution of probabilities for either positive or negative classes. - Notable discrepancies or significant differences between the cumulative probability distributions for the training data versus the test data. - Marked discrepancies or large differences between the cumulative probability distributions for positive and negative classes.\nStrengths: - It offers not only numerical probabilities but also provides a visual illustration of data, which enhances the ease of understanding and interpreting the model’s behavior. - Allows for the comparison of model’s behavior across training and testing datasets, providing insights about how well the model is generalized. - It differentiates between positive and negative classes and their respective distribution patterns, which can aid in problem diagnosis.\nLimitations: - Exclusive to classification tasks and specifically to logistic regression models. - Graphical results necessitate human interpretation and may not be directly applicable for automated risk detection. - The method does not give a solitary quantifiable measure of model risk, rather it offers a visual representation and broad distributional information. - If the training and test datasets are not representative of the overall data distribution, the metric could provide misleading results."

    "text": "ScorecardProbabilitiesHistogram\nEvaluates risk classification of a model by visualizing the distribution of default probability across score buckets.\nPurpose: The Scorecard Probabilities Histogram, a specific metric used within the credit risk domain, is designed to evaluate and visualize risk classification of a model. It aims at examining the distribution of the probability of default across varied score buckets, with the score buckets being categories that entities (e.g., loan applicants) are classed under based on their predicted default risks. The key idea is to ensure that the model accurately classifies entities into appropriate risk categories (score buckets) and aptly represents their default probabilities.\nTest Mechanism: The mechanism behind the Scorecard Probabilities Histogram includes several steps. It starts with the calculation of default probabilities by the ‘compute_probabilities’ method, where the resulting probability is added as a fresh column to the input dataset. Following that, scores are computed using these probabilities, a target score, target odds, and a Points to Double the odds (pdo) factor by the ‘compute_scores method. These scores are then bucketed via the ’compute_buckets’ method. A histogram is then plotted for each score bucket, with default probabilities as the x-axis and their frequency as the y-axis - implemented within the plot_probabilities_histogram’ method. This entire process is executed distinctly for both training and testing datasets.\nSigns of High Risk: - A significant overlap of different score buckets in the histogram indicates that the model is not efficiently distinguishing between various risk categories. - If very high or low probabilities are commonplace across all buckets, the model’s predictions could be skewed.\nStrengths: - The Scorecard Probabilities Histogram allows for the visualization and analysis of the predicted default risk distribution across different risk classes, thereby facilitating a visual inspection of the model’s performance and calibration for various risk categories. - It provides a means to visualize how these classifications are distributed on the training and testing datasets separately, contributing to a better comprehension of model generalization.\nLimitations: - The Scorecard Probabilities Histogram assumes linear and equally spaced risk categories, which might not always hold true. - If there are too few or too many score buckets, the visualization may not convey sufficient information. - While it effectively illustrates the distribution of probabilities, it does not provide adequate numerical metrics or threshold to definitively evaluate the model’s performance. A more accurate evaluation necessitates its usage in conjunction with other metrics and tools including the confusion matrix, AUC-ROC, Precision, Recall, and so forth."

A model with significant autocorrelation may give unreliable predictions.\nTest Mechanism: Utilizing the durbin_watson function in the statsmodels Python library, the Durbin-Watson (DW) Test metric generates a statistical value for each feature of the training dataset. The function is looped over all columns of the dataset, calculating and caching the DW value for each column for further analysis. A DW metric value nearing 2 indicates no autocorrelation. Conversely, values approaching 0 suggest positive autocorrelation, and those leaning towards 4 imply negative autocorrelation.\nSigns of High Risk: - If a feature’s DW value significantly deviates from 2, it could signal a high risk due to potential autocorrelation issues in the dataset. - A value closer to ‘0’ could imply positive autocorrelation, while a value nearer to ‘4’ could point to negative autocorrelation, both leading to potentially unreliable prediction models.\nStrengths: - The metric specializes in identifying autocorrelation in prediction model residuals. - Autocorrelation detection assists in diagnosing violation of various modeling technique assumptions, particularly in regression analysis and time-series data modeling.\nLimitations: - The Durbin-Watson Test mainly detects linear autocorrelation and could overlook other types of relationships. - The metric is highly sensitive to data points order. Shuffling the order could lead to notably different results. - The test only checks for first-order autocorrelation (between a variable and its immediate predecessor) and fails to detect higher order autocorrelation."

These models are primarily used for forecasting time-series data. The validation test automatically fits multiple ARIMA models, with varying parameters, to every variable within the given dataset. The models are then ranked based on their Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values, which provide a basis for the efficient model selection process.\nTest Mechanism: This metric proceeds by generating an array of feasible combinations of ARIMA model parameters which are within a prescribed limit. These limits include max_p, max_d, max_q; they represent the autoregressive, differencing, and moving average components respectively. Upon applying these sets of parameters, the validation test fits each ARIMA model to the time-series data provided. For each model, it subsequently proceeds to calculate and record both the BIC and AIC values, which serve as performance indicators for the model fit. Prior to this parameter fitting process, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for data stationarity is conducted on the data series. If a series is found to be non-stationary, a warning message is sent out, given that ARIMA models necessitate input series to be stationary.\nSigns of High Risk: * If the p-value of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for a variable exceeds 0.05, a warning is logged. This warning indicates that the series might not be stationary, leading to potentially inaccurate results. * Consistent failure in fitting ARIMA models (as made evident through logged errors) might disclose issues with either the data or model stability.\nStrengths: * The AutoARIMA validation test simplifies the often complex task of selecting the most suitable ARIMA model based on BIC and AIC criteria. * The mechanism incorporates a check for non-stationarity within the data, which is a critical prerequisite for ARIMA models. * The exhaustive search through all possible combinations of model parameters enhances the likelihood of identifying the best-fit model.\nLimitations: * This validation test can be computationally costly as it involves creating and fitting multiple ARIMA models for every variable. * Although the test checks for non-stationarity and logs warnings where present, it does not apply any transformations to the data to establish stationarity. * The selection of models leans solely on BIC and AIC criteria, which may not yield the best predictive model in all scenarios. * The test is only applicable to regression tasks involving time-series data, and may not work effectively for other types of machine learning tasks."

It essentially measures how different risk categories (classes) are distributed in the model scores and provides insight into the model’s classification ability.

Within the KPSS score, there are various components, namely: a statistic, a p-value, a used lag, and critical values. The core scheme behind the KPSS score is to test the hypothesis that an observable time series is stationary around a deterministic trend. If the computed statistic surpasses the critical value, the null hypothesis is dismissed, inferring the series is non-stationary.\nSigns of High Risk: - High KPSS score represents a considerable risk, particularly if the calculated statistic is higher than the critical value. - If the null hypothesis is rejected and the series is recognized as non-stationary, it heavily influences the model’s forecasting capability rendering it less effective.\nStrengths: - The KPSS test directly measures the stationarity of a series, allowing it to fulfill a key prerequisite for many time-series models, making it a valuable tool for model validation. - The logics underpinning the test are intuitive and simple, making it understandable and accessible for developers and risk management teams.\nLimitations: - The KPSS test presumes the absence of a unit root in the series and does not differentiate between series that are stationary and those border-lining stationarity. - The test might show restricted power against specific alternatives. - The reliability of the test is contingent on the number of lags selected, which introduces potential bias in the measurement."

It is commonly used in the field of translation evaluation, and its purpose is to assess the accuracy of a model’s output against that of a benchmark.\nTest Mechanism: The BLEU score is implemented using the NLTK’s word_tokenize function to split the text into individual words.

It offers a straightforward way to assess translated text quality, and its calculations often align with human judgments. - The BLEU score breaks down its evaluations at the sentence level, offering granular insights into any errors. - The score consolidates the model’s performance into a single, comprehensive score, making it easy to compare and monitor.\nLimitations: - The BLEU score heavily favours exact matches, which can create a bias towards literal translations. Thus, it may fail to fully evaluate more complex or flexible translations that shy away from a word-for-word structure. - The score does not directly measure the intelligibility or grammatical correctness of the translations. - It may miss errors originating from subtle nuances in language, cultural contexts, or ambiguities."

Purpose: The purpose of this metric is to measure how similar the data points within each cluster of a clustering model are. This is done using cosine similarity, which compares the multi-dimensional direction (but not magnitude) of data vectors. From a Model Risk Management perspective, this metric is used to quantitatively validate that clusters formed by a model have high intra-cluster similarity.\n2. Test Mechanism: This test works by first extracting the true and predicted clusters of the model’s training data. Then, it computes the centroid (average data point) of each cluster. Next, it calculates the cosine similarity between each data point within a cluster and its respective centroid. Finally, it outputs the mean cosine similarity of each cluster, highlighting how similar, on average, data points in a cluster are to the cluster’s centroid.\n3. Signs of High Risk:\n\nLow mean cosine similarity for one or more clusters: If the mean cosine similarity is low, the data points within the respective cluster have high variance in their directions. This can be indicative of poor clustering, suggesting that the model might not be suitably separating the data into distinct patterns.\nHigh disparity between mean cosine similarity values across clusters: If there’s a significant difference in mean cosine similarity across different clusters, this could indicate imbalance in how the model forms clusters.\n\n4. Strengths:\n\nCosine similarity operates in a multi-dimensional space, making it effective for measuring similarity in high dimensional datasets, typical for many machine learning problems.\nIt provides an agnostic view of the cluster performance by only considering the direction (and not the magnitude) of each vector.\nThis metric is not dependent on the scale of the variables, making it equally effective on different scales.\n\n5. Limitations:\n\nCosine similarity does not consider magnitudes (i.e. lengths) of vectors, only their direction. This means it may overlook instances where clusters have been adequately separated in terms of magnitude.\nThis method summarily assumes that centroids represent the average behavior of data points in each cluster. This might not always be true, especially in clusters with high amounts of variance or non-spherical shapes.\nIt primarily works with continuous variables and is not suitable for binary or categorical variables.\nLastly, although rare, perfect perpendicular vectors (cosine similarity = 0) could be within the same cluster, which may give an inaccurate representation of a ‘bad’ cluster due to low cosine similarity score."

It then returns the result as a summary, presenting the metric values for both training and testing datasets.\nSigns of High Risk:\n\nLow Homogeneity Score: This indicates that the clusters formed contain a variety of classes, resulting in less pure clusters.\nLow Completeness Score: This suggests that class instances are scattered across multiple clusters rather than being gathered in a single cluster.\nLow V Measure: This would report a low overall clustering performance.\nARI close to 0 or Negative: This implies that clustering results are random or disagree with the true labels.\nAMI close to 0: It means that clustering labels are random compared with the true labels.\nLow Fowlkes-Mallows score: Signifies less precise and poor clustering performance in terms of precision and recall.\n\nStrengths:\n\nProvides a comprehensive view of clustering model performance by examining multiple clustering metrics.\nUses established and widely accepted metrics from scikit-learn, providing reliability in the results.\nAble to provide performance metrics for both training and testing datasets.\nClearly defined and human-readable descriptions of each score make it easy to understand what each score represents.\n\nLimitations:\n\nIt only applies to clustering models; not suitable for other types of machine learning models.\nDoes not test for overfitting or underfitting in the clustering model.\nAll the scores rely on ground truth labels, the absence or inaccuracy of which can lead to misleading results.\nDoes not consider aspects like computational efficiency of the model or its capability to handle high dimensional data."

Robustness refers to a model’s ability to maintain a high level of performance in the face of perturbations or changes—particularly noise—added to its input data. This test is designed to help gauge how well the model can handle potential real-world scenarios where the input data might be incomplete or corrupted.\nTest Mechanism:\nThis test is conducted by adding Gaussian noise, proportional to a particular standard deviation scale, to numeric input features of both the training and testing datasets. The model performance in the face of these perturbed features is then evaluated using metrics (default: ‘accuracy’). This process is iterated over a range of scale factors. The resulting accuracy trend against the amount of noise introduced is illustrated with a line chart. A predetermined threshold determines what level of accuracy decay due to perturbation is considered acceptable.\nSigns of High Risk: - Substantial decreases in accuracy when noise is introduced to feature inputs. - The decay in accuracy surpasses the configured threshold, indicating that the model is not robust against input noise. - Instances where one or more elements provided in the features list don’t match with the training dataset’s numerical feature columns.\nStrengths: - Provides an empirical measure of the model’s performance in tackling noise or data perturbations, revealing insights into the model’s stability. - Offers flexibility with the ability to choose specific features to perturb and control the level of noise applied. - Detailed results visualization helps in interpreting the outcome of robustness testing.\nLimitations: - Only numerical features are perturbed, leaving out non-numerical features, which can lead to an incomplete analysis of robustness. - The default metric used is accuracy, which might not always give the best measure of a model’s success, particularly for imbalanced datasets. - The test is contingent on the assumption that the added Gaussian noise sufficiently represents potential data corruption or incompleteness in real-world scenarios. - There might be a requirement to fine-tune the set decay threshold for accuracy with the help of domain knowledge or specific project requisites. - The robustness test might not deliver the expected results for datasets with a text column."

The returned score is a metric of the clustering accuracy, and ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 denoting the highest possible degree of homogeneity.\nSigns of High Risk: - A score close to 0: This denotes that clusters are highly heterogenous and points within the same cluster might not belong to the same class. - A significantly lower score for testing data compared to the score for training data: This can indicate overfitting, where the model has learned to perfectly match the training data but fails to perform well on unseen data.\nStrengths: - It provides a simple quantitative measure of the degree to which clusters contain points from only one class. - Useful for validating clustering solutions where the ground truth - class membership of points - is known. - It’s agnostic to the absolute labels, and cares only that the points within the same cluster have the same class label.\nLimitations: - The Homogeneity Score is not useful for clustering solutions where the ground truth labels are not known. - It doesn’t work well with differently sized clusters since it gives predominance to larger clusters. - The score does not address the actual number of clusters formed, or the evenness of cluster sizes.

The ultimate aim is to identify areas where the model’s performance falls below the set thresholds, thereby exposing its possible weaknesses and limitations.\nTest Mechanism: The test mechanism adopts an approach of dividing the feature space of the training dataset into numerous bins. The model’s performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 scores) are then computed for each bin on both the training and test datasets. A “weak spot” is identified if any of the performance metrics fall below a predetermined threshold for a particular bin on the test dataset.

It intends to measure and evaluate the optimal number of clusters by leveraging two methodologies, namely the Elbow method and the Silhouette method. This is crucial as an inappropriate number of clusters can either overly simplify or overcomplicate the structure of the data, thereby undermining the effectiveness of the model.\nTest Mechanism: The test mechanism involves iterating over a predefined range of cluster numbers and applying both the Elbow method and the Silhouette method. The Elbow method computes the sum of the minimum euclidean distances between data points and their respective cluster centers (distortion). This value decreases as the number of clusters increases; the optimal number is typically at the ‘elbow’ point where the decrease in distortion becomes less pronounced. Meanwhile, the Silhouette method calculates the average silhouette score for each data point in the dataset, providing a measure of how similar each item is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. The optimal number of clusters under this method is the one that maximizes the average silhouette score. The results of both methods are plotted for visual inspection.\nSigns of High Risk: - A high distortion value or a low silhouette average score for the optimal number of clusters. - No clear ‘elbow’ point or plateau observed in the distortion plot, or a uniformly low silhouette average score across different numbers of clusters, suggesting the data is not amenable to clustering. - An optimal cluster number that is unreasonably high or low, suggestive of overfitting or underfitting, respectively.\nStrengths: - Provides both a visual and quantitative method to determine the optimal number of clusters. - Leverages two different methods (Elbow and Silhouette), thereby affording robustness and versatility in assessing the data’s clusterability. - Facilitates improved model performance by allowing for an informed selection of the number of clusters.\nLimitations: - Assumes that a suitable number of clusters exists in the data, which may not always be true, especially for complex or noisy data. - Both methods may fail to provide definitive answers when the data lacks clear cluster structures. - Might not be straightforward to determine the ‘elbow’ point or maximize the silhouette average score, especially in larger and complicated datasets. - Assumes spherical clusters (due to using the Euclidean distance in the Elbow method), which might not align with the actual structure of the data."

In combination with the Area Under the Curve (AUC), the ROC curve aims to measure the model’s discrimination ability between the two defined classes in a binary classification problem (e.g., default vs non-default). Ideally, a higher AUC score signifies superior model performance in accurately distinguishing between the positive and negative classes.\nTest Mechanism: First, this script selects the target model and datasets that require binary classification. It then calculates the predicted probabilities for the test set, and uses this data, along with the true outcomes, to generate and plot the ROC curve. Additionally, it concludes a line signifying randomness (AUC of 0.5). The AUC score for the model’s ROC curve is also computed, presenting a numerical estimation of the model’s performance.

The resulting ROC curve, AUC score, and thresholds are consequently saved for future reference.\nSigns of High Risk: - A high risk is potentially linked to the model’s performance if the AUC score drops below or nears 0.5. - Another warning sign would be the ROC curve lying closer to the line of randomness, indicating no discriminative ability. - For the model to be deemed competent at its classification tasks, it is crucial that the AUC score is significantly above 0.5.\nStrengths: - This ROC Curve offers an inclusive visual depiction of a model’s discriminative power throughout all conceivable classification thresholds, unlike other metrics that solely disclose model performance at one fixed threshold. - Despite the proportions of the dataset, the AUC Score, which represents the entire ROC curve as a single data point, continues to be consistent, proving to be the ideal choice for such situations.\nLimitations: - The primary limitation is that this test is exclusively structured for binary classification tasks, thus limiting its application towards other model types. - Furthermore, its performance might be subpar with models that output probabilities highly skewed towards 0 or 1. - At the extreme, the ROC curve could reflect high performance even when the majority of classifications are incorrect, provided that the model’s ranking format is retained.

    "text": "RougeMetrics\nEvaluates the quality of machine-generated text using various ROUGE metrics, and visualizes the results.\nPurpose: The ROUGE, or Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation, is a metric employed to assess the quality of machine-generated text. This evaluation technique is mainly used in natural language processing tasks, such as text summarization, machine translation, and text generation. Its goal is to measure how well the machine-generated text reflects the key information and concepts in the human-crafted reference text.\nTest Mechanism:\n\nComparison Procedure: The testing mechanism involves comparing machine-generated content with a reference human-constructed text.\nIntegral Metrics:\n\n\nROUGE-N (N-gram Overlap): This evaluates the overlap of n-grams (sequences of n words) between the generated and reference texts. The common n-values are 1 (unigrams), 2 (bigrams), and 3 (trigrams). Each metric calculates precision, recall, and F1-score.\nROUGE-L (Longest Common Subsequence): This identifies the longest shared word sequence in both the machine and reference texts, thus evaluating the capability of the generated text to mirror key phrases.\nROUGE-S (Skip-bigram): This measures the concurrence of skip-bigrams — word pairings that appear within a predefined word window in the text. This metric maintains sensitivity to word order while allowing for sporadic word omissions.\n\n\nVisual Representation: Precision, recall, and F1-score for all the metrics are visually charted, which makes the results easier to comprehend.\n\nSigns of High Risk:\n\nLow scores across the suite of ROUGE metrics\nLow precision might indicate redundant information in machine-produced text\nLow recall may suggest the omission of important information from the reference text\nLow F1 score could indicate an imbalanced performance between precision and recall\nPersistent low scores could signal inherent flaws in the model\n\nStrengths:\n\nOffers a multifaceted perspective on text quality using various evaluation metrics\nAdapts to synonyms and rewording, thanks to n-gram-based evaluation\nEncourages the retention of key word sequences using the longest common subsequence method\nVisual representation of precision, recall, and F1-scores enhances understandability of model performance\n\nLimitations:\n\nMay fail to fully address the semantic coherence, fluency, or grammatical quality of the generated text\nTends to evaluate isolated phrases or n-grams rather than comprehensive sentences\nMay prove challenging when reference texts are difficult or impractical to obtain due to its reliance on comparisons with human-made references."

These perturbations include:\n\nSwapping two adjacent words\nIntroducing a random typo in a word\nDeleting a random word\nInserting a random word at a random position\n\nPurpose: The purpose of the stability analysis is to evaluate the robustness of a text embeddings model to random noise. Random perturbations such as swapping adjacent words, introducing random typos, deleting random words, or inserting random words at random positions in the text are introduced, to gauge the model’s performance and stability.\nTest Mechanism: The test mechanism includes a series of function-defined random perturbations like swapping two words random_swap, introducing a typo in a word introduce_typo, deleting a random word random_deletion, and inserting a random word at a random position random_insertion. A probability parameter determines the likelihood or frequency of these perturbations within the text data.\nThe perturb_data function initally tokenizes the string data based on spaces then applies selected random perturbations based on the provided probability for each word in the text.\nSigns of High Risk: - High error rates in model predictions or classifications after the introduction of the random noise - Greater sensitivity to certain types and degrees of noise such as typographical errors, insertion or deletion of words - Significant change in loss function or accuracy metric - Inconsistency in model outputs for slightly perturbed inputs\nStrengths: - Measures model robustness against noise thereby reflecting real-world scenarios where data may contain errors or inconsistencies. - Easy to implement with adjustable perturbation severity through probability parameter. - Enables identification of model sensitivity to certain noise types, providing grounding for model improvement. - Useful for testing models designed to handle text data.\nLimitations: - The test might not be effective for models that have been designed with a high resistance to noise or models that are inherently designed to handle such perturbations. - Pseudo-randomness may not accurately represent real-world distribution of noise or typographical errors, which could be biased towards certain types of errors or malware injections. - Highly dependent on the probability parameter to introduce noise, with artificial adjusting required to achieve an optimal balance. - Only validates the model’s performance against noise in input data, not its ability to capture complex language structures or semantics. - Does not guarantee the model’s performance in new, unseen, real-world data beyond what is represented by the noise-introduced test data."

By dividing the text embeddings into different clusters, we can understand how the model is grouping or categorizing the text data. This aids in visualizing the organization and segregation of the data and thus gives an understanding of how the model is processing the data.\nTest Mechanism: The metric applies the KMeans clustering algorithm on the predictions made by the model on the testing dataset and divides the text embeddings into a pre-defined number of clusters. By default, this number is set to 5 but can be customized as per requirements. The output of this test is a histogram plot that shows the distribution of embeddings across these clusters.\nSigns of High Risk:\n\nIf the embeddings are skewed towards one or two clusters, that would indicate that the model is not effectively differentiating the various categories in the text data.\nUniform distribution of the embeddings across the clusters might show a lack of proper categorization.\n\nStrengths:\n\nGreat tool to visualize the text data categorization by the model. It provides a way to assess if the model is distinguishing the categories effectively or not.\nIt is flexible with the number of clusters (classes), so can be used on various types of data regardless of the number of categories.\n\nLimitations:\n\nThe success or failure of this test is based on visual interpretation, which might not be enough for making solid conclusions or determining the exact points of failure.\nIt assumes that the division of text embeddings across clusters should ideally be homogeneous, which might not always be the case depending on the nature of the text data.\nIt only applies to text embedding models, reducing its utility across various ML models.\nThis test uses the KMeans clustering algorithm, which assumes that clusters are convex and isotropic. Thus, this test may not work as intended if the true clusters in the data are not of this shape."

Purpose: This metric, Descriptive Analytics for Text Embeddings Models, is employed to comprehend the fundamental properties and statistical characteristics of the embeddings in a Machine Learning model. It measures the dimensionality as well as the statistical distributions of embedding values including the mean, median, and standard deviation.\n2. Test Mechanism: The test mechanism involves using the ‘DescriptiveAnalytics’ class provided in the code which includes the ’run function. This function computes three statistical measures - mean, median, and standard deviation of the test predictions from the model. It generates and caches three separate histograms showing the distribution of these measures. Each histogram visualizes the measure’s distribution across the embedding values. Therefore, the method does not utilize a grading scale or threshold; it is fundamentally a visual exploration and data exploration tool.\n3. Signs of High Risk:\n\nAbnormal patterns or values in the distributions of the statistical measures. This may include skewed distributions or a significant amount of outliers.\nVery high standard deviation values which indicate a high degree of variability in the data.\nThe mean and median values are vastly different, suggesting skewed data.\n\n4. Strengths:\n\nProvides a visual and quantifiable understanding of the embeddings’ statistical characteristics, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation.\nFacilitates the identification of irregular patterns and anomalous values that might indicate issues with the machine learning model.\nIt considers three key statistical measures (mean, median, and standard deviation), offering a more well-rounded understanding of the data.\n\n5. Limitations:\n\nThe method does not offer an explicit measure of model performance or accuracy, as it mainly focuses on understanding data properties.\nIt relies heavily on the visual interpretation of histograms.

A keyword swap is a scenario where instances of certain specified keywords in the dataset are replaced with other specified words (usually synonyms). The purpose of this metric is to ensure that these models maintain performance stability even when the input data slightly deviates, imitating real-world variability.\nTest Mechanism: The test mechanism involves perturbation of the dataset used in testing the model. Each instance of a specific word found in the dataset is replaced with the corresponding word as specified in a keyword_dict’ mapping. The model is then re-run with the perturbed dataset and the results are compared with the non-perturbed dataset. This comparison quantifies the extent to which keyword swaps impact the model’s performance.\nSigns of High Risk: - A significant drop in model performance after keyword swaps indicates a high risk of model failure in real-world scenarios. - The model results being heavily reliant on specific word choices instead of capturing the context properly.\nStrengths: - This test provides a way to measure model robustness to small changes in input data, which reinforces its applicability and reliability in real-world scenarios. - This test encourages a model to understand the context of a sentence rather than memorizing specific words. - It helps to detect overfitting - a situation where a model performs well on training data but poorly on new or slightly altered data.\nLimitations: - It may not fully address semantic differences that can be introduced through keyword swaps. That is, the replacement words might not preserve the exact semantic meaning of the original words. - It only tests for changes in keywords (word-level alterations) and might not expose model limitations related to structural data changes. - It assumes that the provided ‘keyword_dict’ is an accurate representation of possible real-world variations, which might not always be the case."

It aims to ensure that the instructions embedded in a prompt are indisputably clear and relevant, thereby helping to yank out ambiguity and steer the LLM towards desired outputs. This level of specificity significantly affects the accuracy and relevance of LLM outputs.\nTest Mechanism: The Specificity Test employs an LLM to grade each prompt based on clarity, detail, and relevance parameters within a specificity scale that extends from 1 to 10.

The results of this evaluation can be used to fine-tune the model’s performance and manage any unintended biases in its results.\nTest Mechanism: This test uses two checks:\n\nDistribution of Exemplars: The number of positive vs. negative examples in a prompt is varied. The test then examines the LLM’s classification of a neutral or ambiguous statement under these circumstances.\nOrder of Exemplars: The sequence in which positive and negative examples are presented to the model is modified. Their resultant effect on the LLM’s response is studied.\n\nFor each test case, the LLM grades the input prompt on a scale of 1 to 10. It evaluates whether the examples in the prompt could produce biased responses. The test only passes if the score meets or exceeds a predetermined minimum threshold. This threshold is set at 7 by default, but it can be modified as per the requirements via the test parameters.\nSigns of High Risk:\n\nA skewed result favoring either positive or negative responses may suggest potential bias in the model. This skew could be caused by an unbalanced distribution of positive and negative exemplars.\nIf the score given by the model is less than the set minimum threshold, it might indicate a risk of high bias and hence poor performance.\n\nStrengths:\n\nThis test provides a quantitative measure of potential bias, providing clear guidelines for developers about whether their Large Language Model (LLM) contains significant bias.\nIt’s useful in evaluating the impartiality of the model based on the distribution and sequence of examples.\nThe flexibility to adjust the minimum required threshold allows tailoring this test to stricter or more lenient bias standards.\n\nLimitations:\n\nThe test may not pick up on more subtle forms of bias or biases that are not directly related to the distribution or order of exemplars.\nThe test’s effectiveness will decrease if the quality or balance of positive and negative exemplars is not representative of the problem space the model is intended to solve.\nThe use of a grading mechanism to gauge bias may not be entirely accurate in every case, particularly when the difference between threshold and score is narrow."

    "text": "This release includes a number of improvements for the developer experience when using the ValidMind Developer Framework, along with a visual redesign of the Platform UI.\n\n\n\n\n\nImproved developer experience for the Metric test class. We made a number of enhancements to the ValidMind Developer Framework to improve the experience for developers:\n\nBetter test organization: Added a metadata and tags attribute to the Test base class for better categorization and filtering of tests.\nBetter filtering: Added a new task_type argument to the list_tests() function to allow simple filtering by task_type set in a test.\nClearer naming: Renamed required_context to required_inputs across the whole ValidMind SDK.\n\n\n\n\nEnhancements to test configuration discovery: To make the discovery of required context and default configuration easier, this update includes a number of changes to how required_context and default_parameters are presented:\n\nPreview template expansion: With vm.preview_template(), you can now view detailed, expandable information for each content block driven by a test. This includes the test’s name, description, required context, and default parameters.\nSimplified test listing: The vm.tests.list_tests() function has been refined to show only the ID, Name, and Description for each test, making it more user-friendly.\nDetailed test descriptions: You can now obtain complete test details, including required_context and default_params, using the vm.tests.describe_test() function.\nRetrieve test suite: The new function vm.get_test_suite() allows you to access a specific test suite instance via the high-level Validmind API.\nAccess to default configuration: A new method, get_default_config(), is now part of both the TestPlan and TestSuite classes, letting you obtain a dictionary containing all the configuration parameters used by the tests.\nEasier required context: A complementary new method, get_required_context(), now returns a list of all the context variables needed for tests to run, making it easier for you to ensure that everything is set up correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRedesigned application and navigation bar layout. The new application design offers a cleaner, more intuitive interface that enhances user experience. The updated navigation bar layout specifically contributes to easier navigation, allowing users to find what they need with greater efficiency."

    "text": "What is the Developer Framework?\nValidMind’s Developer Framework provides a rich collection of documentation tools and test suites, from documenting descriptions of your dataset to validation testing your models for weak spots and overfit areas.\nYou use the framework to automate the generation of model documentation by uploading documentation artifacts and test results to the ValidMind platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidMind offers two primary methods for documenting model risk:\n\nBy generating model documentation: Through automation, the framework extracts metadata from associated datasets and models for you and generates model documentation. You can also add more documentation and tests manually using the documentation editing capabilities in the ValidMind UI.\nBy running pre-built validation tests: The framework provides a suite of validation tests for common financial services use cases. For cases where these tests do not cover everything you need, you can also extend existing test suites with your own proprietary tests or testing providers.\n\nThe Developer Framework is designed to be model agnostic. If your model is built in Python, ValidMind’s Python client library already provides all the standard functionality you might need without requiring your developers to rewrite any functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Key ValidMind concepts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel documentation\n\nThe purpose of model documentation is to provide transparency, facilitate understanding, and enable effective governance and oversight of the model. Provides a comprehensive record and description of a quantitative model. Should encompass all relevant information about the model in accordance with:\n\n\n\nIntended use\nRegulatory requirements set by regulatory bodies\nModel risk policies set by your institution\nAssumptions\nMethodologies\nData and inputs\nModel performance evaluation\nLimitations\n\n\nDocumentation project\n\nAll documentation work in ValidMind is organized into projects which act as a container for the model documentation and validation report of your model. Each stage of the model’s lifecycle constitutes a new project and can be configured with its own templates and workflows.\n\nTemplate, Documentation Template\n\nFunctions as a test suite and lays out the structure of model documentation, segmented into various sections and sub-sections. ValidMind templates come with pre-defined sections, similar to test placeholders, including boilerplates and spaces designated for documentation and test results.\n\n\nModel documentation is populated when the tests contained in a template run successfully, completing the test suite. This process ensures that the model meets all the specified requirements. At the same time, template placeholders get populated with content that documents the model. This content is generated by the ValidMind Developer Framework, providing a coherent structure for model information.\nEssentially, our platform scans these templates, identifies all tests, and systematically organizes them into a well-structured test suite. This automation enhances the efficiency and consistency of the validation process.\nThe criteria for these templates are typically provided by your model risk management team. We provide some templates out of the box that you can use and programmatically customize to suit the requirements of each model use case. This task of customization is usually performed by an administrator, who ensures that the templates align with the organizational standards and specific needs of each model.\n\nTests\n\nA function contained in the ValidMind Developer Framework, which is designed to run a specific quantitative test on the dataset or model. Test results are sent to the ValidMind Platform to generate the model documentation according to the relevant templates.\n\nTest suites\n\nA collection of tests which are meant to run together to automate generate model documentation end-to-end for specific use-cases.\n\n\nExample: the classifier_full_suite test suite runs the tests from the tabular_dataset and classifier test suites to fully document the data and model sections for binary classification model use-cases."

This step includes all the usual activities you already follow as a model developer.\n\nGenerate model documentation\n\nWith the ValidMind Developer Framework, generate automated model documentation and run validation tests. This step includes making use of the automation and testing functionality provided by the framework and uploading the output to the Platform UI. You can iteratively regenerate the documentation as you work though the next step of refining your documentation.\n\nRefine model documentation\n\nIn the ValidMind Platform UI, review the generated documentation and test output. Iterate over the documentation and test output to refine your model documentation. Collaborate with other developers and model validators to finalize the model documentation and get it ready for review.\n\nSubmit for review\n\nIn the ValidMind Platform UI, you submit the model documentation for review which moves the documentation workflow moves to the next phase where a model validator will review it."

    "text": "How are parallel editing and version control handled?\nValidMind currently allows multiple users to simultaneously edit documentation in the ValidMind UI. If two users are editing the same cell on the UI, the most recently saved version of the content will prevail.\nValidMind is implementing more sophisticated version control features:\n\nValidMind will provide a detailed version and revision history, and notification system, for you to view what changes have been applied to the documentation (roadmap item for Q2’2023).\nThe platform will provide an indication if another user is currently editing the same cell on the online UI (roadmap item for Q3’2023).\nAdministrators will be given the ability to configure content syncing and session management preferences (roadmap item currently scheduled for Q4’2023).\n\n\n\nCan we work with disconnected workflows?\nValidMind supports disconnected workflows natively at the data-collection level since the Developer Framework creates individual test runs every time a new test iteration is executed. This allows for running parallel/disconnected tests that individually send results to the ValidMind API.\nVisualizing the disconnected workflow in terms of model testing and documentation will depend on requirements at the use-case level.\n\n\nCan the workflow accommodate an additional review step, before the documentation gets sent to the 2nd line model validation team?\nWith ValidMind, administrators can create custom workflows for the review and approval of documentation.\nThese workflows can be configured to include any number of review stages before submission, and administrators can configure which stakeholders will be involved at each stage.\nValidMind is also implementing the ability for administrators to configure default user roles and user groups or teams as part of initial onboarding onto the tool (roadmap item – Q2 2023).\n\n\n\nHow flexible is ValidMind to accommodate our own model development and review workflows?\nValidMind allows administrators to create custom workflows for the review and approval of documentation, once the user decides it is ready for review.\nThese workflows can be configured to include any number of review stages before submission, and administrators can configure which stakeholders are involved at each stage.\nYou can also leverage ValidMind’s Developer Framework once you are ready to document a specific model for review and validation. That is, you do not need to use ValidMind while you are in the exploration or R&D phase of model development."

With support for custom tests, you can now go beyond the default set of documentation and testing components provided by ValidMind, and use our Developer Framework to document any type of model or use case. Learn more …\nIntegrate external test providers. With test providers, you can now integrate external test libraries to expand the set of tests available through the ValidMind Developer Framework, or create your own test libraries. This enables registering custom tests under a namespace to make them available globally. We provide a couple of demo scenarios with such test providers and show how you can register them with Validmind so that they can run a template utilizing your tests. Learn more …\nSimplified documentation and testing using templates. Templates now function as dynamic test suites, allowing you to identify all the documentation components & test results mapped to a specific template. This makes it easier to fill a pre-configured template (including boilerplates and spaces designated for documentation and test results) with a single command, instead of running multiple test suites. Learn more …\n\n\n\nNew notebook to illustrate natural language processing (NLP) data analysis and text classification use case. Learn how to use the ValidMind Framework to document and test an NLP data analysis and text classification model. The emphasis of this notebook is on documenting and testing the in-depth analysis and preprocessing of the text data, in this case, COVID-19 related tweets. Learn more …\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can now edit the documentation templates that get used for model documentation or for validation reports. This feature is relevant for administrators who need to configure templates for specific use cases, or where the existing templates supplied by ValidMind need to be customized. Editing allows to configure sections, sub-sections, and content blocks inside a template. Learn more …\nWe improved the search feature in the Platform UI to make search results more compact."

With support for custom tests, you can now go beyond the default set of documentation and testing components provided by ValidMind, and use our Developer Framework to document any type of model or use case. Learn more …\nIntegrate external test providers. With test providers, you can now integrate external test libraries to expand the set of tests available through the ValidMind Developer Framework, or create your own test libraries. This enables registering custom tests under a namespace to make them available globally. We provide a couple of demo scenarios with such test providers and show how you can register them with Validmind so that they can run a template utilizing your tests. Learn more …\nSimplified documentation and testing using templates. Templates now function as dynamic test suites, allowing you to identify all the documentation components & test results mapped to a specific template. This makes it easier to fill a pre-configured template (including boilerplates and spaces designated for documentation and test results) with a single command, instead of running multiple test suites. Learn more …\n\n\n\nNew notebook to illustrate natural language processing (NLP) data analysis and text classification use case. Learn how to use the ValidMind Framework to document and test an NLP data analysis and text classification model. The emphasis of this notebook is on documenting and testing the in-depth analysis and preprocessing of the text data, in this case, COVID-19 related tweets. Learn more …\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can now edit the documentation templates that get used for model documentation or for validation reports. This feature is relevant for administrators who need to configure templates for specific use cases, or where the existing templates supplied by ValidMind need to be customized. Editing allows to configure sections, sub-sections, and content blocks inside a template. Learn more …\nWe improved the search feature in the Platform UI to make search results more compact."

    "text": "What do I use the ValidMind platform for?\nModel developers and validators play important roles in managing model risk, including risk that stems from generative AI and machine learning models. From complying with regulations to ensuring that institutional standards are followed, your team members are tasked with the careful documentation, testing, and independent validation of models.\nThe purpose of these efforts is to ensure that good risk management principles are followed throughout the model lifecycle. To assist you with these processes of documenting and validating models, ValidMind provides a number of tools that you can employ regardless of the technology used to build your models.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ValidMind AI risk platform provides two main products components:\n\nThe Developer Framework is a library of tools and methods designed to automate generating model documentation and running validation tests. The framework is designed to be platform agnostic and integrates with your existing development environment.\nFor Python developers, a single installation command provides access to all the functions:\npip install validmind\nThe ValidMind AI Risk Platform is an easy-to-use web-based UI that enables you to track the model lifecycle:\n\n\nCustomize workflows to manage the model documentation and validation process.\nReview and edit the documentation and test metrics generated by the Developer Framework.\nCollaborate with and capture feedback from model developers and model validators.\nGenerate validation reports and approvals\n\nFor more information about the benefits that ValidMind can offer, check out the ValidMind overview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Key ValidMind concepts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel documentation\n\nThe purpose of model documentation is to provide transparency, facilitate understanding, and enable effective governance and oversight of the model. Provides a comprehensive record and description of a quantitative model. Should encompass all relevant information about the model in accordance with:\n\n\n\nIntended use\nRegulatory requirements set by regulatory bodies\nModel risk policies set by your institution\nAssumptions\nMethodologies\nData and inputs\nModel performance evaluation\nLimitations\n\n\nDocumentation project\n\nAll documentation work in ValidMind is organized into projects which act as a container for the model documentation and validation report of your model. Each stage of the model’s lifecycle constitutes a new project and can be configured with its own templates and workflows.\n\nTemplate, Documentation Template\n\nFunctions as a test suite and lays out the structure of model documentation, segmented into various sections and sub-sections. ValidMind templates come with pre-defined sections, similar to test placeholders, including boilerplates and spaces designated for documentation and test results.\n\n\nModel documentation is populated when the tests contained in a template run successfully, completing the test suite. This process ensures that the model meets all the specified requirements. At the same time, template placeholders get populated with content that documents the model. This content is generated by the ValidMind Developer Framework, providing a coherent structure for model information.\nEssentially, our platform scans these templates, identifies all tests, and systematically organizes them into a well-structured test suite. This automation enhances the efficiency and consistency of the validation process.\nThe criteria for these templates are typically provided by your model risk management team. We provide some templates out of the box that you can use and programmatically customize to suit the requirements of each model use case. This task of customization is usually performed by an administrator, who ensures that the templates align with the organizational standards and specific needs of each model.\n\nTests\n\nA function contained in the ValidMind Developer Framework, which is designed to run a specific quantitative test on the dataset or model. Test results are sent to the ValidMind Platform to generate the model documentation according to the relevant templates.\n\nTest suites\n\nA collection of tests which are meant to run together to automate generate model documentation end-to-end for specific use-cases.\n\n\nExample: the classifier_full_suite test suite runs the tests from the tabular_dataset and classifier test suites to fully document the data and model sections for binary classification model use-cases."

    "text": "How do I get started?\nOn the ValidMind platform, everything starts with the model inventory: you first register a new model and then manage the model lifecycle through the different activities that are part of your existing model risk management processes.\n\nApproval workflow\nA typical high-level model approval workflow looks like this:\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR\n    A[Model&lt;br&gt;registration] --&gt; B[Initial&lt;br&gt;validation]\n    B --&gt; C[Validation&lt;br&gt;approval]\n    C --&gt; D[In production]\n    D --&gt; E[Periodic review&lt;br&gt;and revalidation]\n    E --&gt; B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew model registration\n\nSelect a documentation template when registering a new inventory model to start a documentation project. You then use the model inventory to manage the metadata associated with the model, including all compliance and regulatory attributes.\n\nInitial validation\n\nTriggers a new documentation workflow to yield a model that will be ready for production deployment after its documentation and validation reports have been approved.\n\nValidation approval\n\nPerform validation of the model to ensure that it meets the needs for which it was designed. You can also connect to third-party systems to send events when a model has been approved for production.\n\nIn production\n\nUse the model in production while ensuring its ongoing reliability, accuracy, and compliance with regulations by monitoring the model’s performance.\n\nPeriodic review and revalidation\n\nAs part of regular performance monitoring or change management, you follow a process similar to that seen in the Initial validation step.\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation workflow\nOut of the box, the documentation project workflow is configured like this:\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR\n    A[In documentation] --&gt; B[In validation]\n    B --&gt; C[In review /&lt;br&gt;under approval]\n    C --&gt; D[Approved]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn documentation\n\nYour model developers use the ValidMind Developer Framework to run validation tests and generate automated model documentation. They then use the ValidMind UI to populate qualitative documentation sections. This phase is the most critical and involved for model developers.\n\n\nTo learn more about documenting models, see Get started with the Developer Framework.\n\nIn validation\n\nYour model validators review the model documentation and challenge the model:\n\n\n\nCollaborate in the ValidMind UI to facilitate question and answer threads to collect more information from model developers.\nChallenge the model with the ValidMind Developer Framework to replicate test results and conduct your own testing.\n\nValidators then use the ValidMind UI to generate a validation report and manage the findings discovered during the model review process.\n\nIn review / under approval\n\nSenior risk managers and executives use the ValidMind UI to review validation report and findings to make a final decision.\n\n\nThe generated validation report contains detailed information about the models being evaluated, including their underlying assumptions, methodologies, and performance metrics. It also highlights any potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities that may be present in the models.\n\nApproved\n\nApproval signifies the final endorsement and authorization for a model to be used in production. Approval occurs after careful examination and validation of the model, ensuring that it meets institutional standards and guidelines, and regulatory requirements."

Consequences of unmitigated model risk can include adverse outcomes such as financial loss, damage to reputation, and regulatory penalties, for example.\n\nmodel governance\n\nA framework of policies, procedures, and standards established to oversee the lifecycle of models within an organization. Ensures that models are developed, validated, implemented, and retired in a controlled and consistent manner, promoting accountability, transparency, and adherence to regulatory requirements.\n\nmodel validation\n\nA systematic process to evaluate and verify that a model is performing as intended, accurately represents the phenomena it is designed to capture, and is appropriate for its specified purpose. This assessment encompasses a review of the model’s conceptual soundness, data integrity, calibration, and performance outcomes, as well as testing against out-of-sample datasets. Within model risk management, model validation ensures that potential risks associated with model errors, misuse, or misunderstanding are identified and mitigated.\n\nmodel validator\n\nresponsible for conducting independent assessments of models to ensure their accuracy, reliability, and appropriateness for intended purposes. The role involves evaluating a model’s conceptual soundness, data integrity, calibration methods, and overall performance, typically using out-of-sample datasets. Model validators identify potential risks and weaknesses, ensuring that models within an organization meet established standards and regulatory requirements, and provide recommendations to model developers for improvements or modifications.\n\nthree lines of defense\n\nA structured approach to model risk management, consisting of three independent functions. The first line consists of business units responsible for model development, validation, and implementation. They ensure that models are accurate, robust, and fit for purpose.

Each stage of the model’s lifecycle constitutes a new project and can be configured with its own templates and workflows.\n\nTemplate, Documentation Template\n\nFunctions as a test suite and lays out the structure of model documentation, segmented into various sections and sub-sections. ValidMind templates come with pre-defined sections, similar to test placeholders, including boilerplates and spaces designated for documentation and test results.\n\n\nModel documentation is populated when the tests contained in a template run successfully, completing the test suite. This process ensures that the model meets all the specified requirements. At the same time, template placeholders get populated with content that documents the model. This content is generated by the ValidMind Developer Framework, providing a coherent structure for model information.\nEssentially, our platform scans these templates, identifies all tests, and systematically organizes them into a well-structured test suite. This automation enhances the efficiency and consistency of the validation process.\nThe criteria for these templates are typically provided by your model risk management team. We provide some templates out of the box that you can use and programmatically customize to suit the requirements of each model use case. This task of customization is usually performed by an administrator, who ensures that the templates align with the organizational standards and specific needs of each model.\n\nTests\n\nA function contained in the ValidMind Developer Framework, which is designed to run a specific quantitative test on the dataset or model. Test results are sent to the ValidMind Platform to generate the model documentation according to the relevant templates.\n\nTest suites\n\nA collection of tests which are meant to run together to automate generate model documentation end-to-end for specific use-cases.\n\n\nExample: the classifier_full_suite test suite runs the tests from the tabular_dataset and classifier test suites to fully document the data and model sections for binary classification model use-cases."

We made a number of changes to metrics to improve the developer experience:\n\nA new fail_fast argument can be passed to run_test_plan, run_test_suite and run_documentation_tests, used to fail and raise an exception on the first error encountered. This change is useful for debugging.\nClassifierPerformance test now determines if you are testing a binary or a multi-class model. When testing a multi-class model, we now report additional per-class, macro and weighted average metrics.\nFixed F1 score metric so it works correctly for binary and multi-class models.\n\n\n\n\nAdded multi-class classification support. The Developer Framework now supports a multi-class version of some the existing metrics, such as confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and more. Also, the dataset and model interfaces now support dealing with multiple targets.\n\n\n\nImplemented classification model comparison metrics. Added a model performance comparison test for classification tasks. The test includes metrics such as accuracy, F1, precision, recall, and roc_auc score.\n\n\n\nTrack additional test metadata. Added a metadata property to every ValidMind test class. The metadata property includes a task_types field and a tags field which both serve to categorize the tests based on what data and model types they work with, what category of test they fall into, and more.\n\n\n\nFilter tests by task type and tags. We added a new search feature to the validmind.tests.list_tests function to allow for better test discoverability. The list_tests function in the tests module now supports the following arguments:\n\nfilter: If set, will match tests by ID, task_types or tags using a combination of substring and fuzzy string matching. Defaults to None.\ntask: If set, will further narrow matching tests (assuming filter has been passed) by exact matching the task to the test’s task_type metadata. Defaults to None.\ntags: If a list is passed, will again narrow the matched tests by exact matching on tags. Defaults to None."

    "text": "Robustness\nAssesses the robustness of prompts provided to a Large Language Model under varying conditions and contexts.\nPurpose: The Robustness test is meant to evaluate the resilience and reliability of prompts provided to a Language Learning Model (LLM). The aim of this test is to guarantee that the prompts consistently generate accurate and the expected outputs, despite being in diverse or challenging scenarios.\nTest Mechanism: The Robustness test appraises prompts under various conditions, alterations, and contexts to ascertain their stability in producing consistent responses from the LLM. Factors evaluated range from different phrasings, inclusion of potential distracting elements, and various input complexities. By default, the test generates 10 inputs for a prompt but can be adjusted according to test parameters.\nSigns of High Risk:\n\nIf the output from the tests diverges extensively from the expected results, this indicates high risk.\nWhen the prompt doesn’t give a consistent performance across various tests.\nA high risk is indicated when the prompt is susceptible to breaking, especially when the output is expected to be of a specific type.\n\nStrengths:\n\nThe robustness test helps to ensure stable performance of the LLM prompts and lowers the chances of generating unexpected or off-target outputs.\nThis test is vital for applications where predictability and reliability of the LLM’s output are crucial.\n\nLimitations:\n\nCurrently, the test only supports single-variable prompts, which restricts its application to more complex models.\nWhen there are too many target classes (over 10), the test is skipped, which can leave potential vulnerabilities unchecked in complex multi-class models.\nThe test may not account for all potential conditions or alterations that could show up in practical use scenarios."

Any significant changes in the model’s output between the original and translated-then-retranslated texts can be indicators of the model’s lack of robustness to noise.\nTest Mechanism: The test mechanism involves several steps:\n\nInitialize the Marian tokenizer and model for both source and target languages.\nTranslate the data from the source language to the target language.\nTranslate the translated data back into the source language.\nCompare the original data with the data that has been translated and back-translated to observe any significant changes.\n\nThe threshold of this test output would then be determined by the tolerance level of the model to these potentially noisy instances.\nSigns of High Risk:\n\nIf there large discrepancies between the original and double-translated text, this could indicate a high level of risk, signifying that the model is not robust to noise.\nIf a translation between languages does not closely maintain the meaning and context of the original language, it may suggest inadequate robustness against this type of noise.\n\nStrengths:\n\nThis metric is an effective way to assess the model’s sensitivity and robustness to language translation noise.\nThe use of translation as a means to introduce noise provides a realistic scenario which the model might encounter in real-world situations.\nThis metric extends beyond simple lexical changes, testing the model’s capacity to maintain semantic meaning under translational perturbations.\n\nLimitations:\n\nRelying solely on translation-related noise for robustness testing can overlook other types of noise not reflected in language translation, such as typographical errors, grammatical mistakes, or random word substitutions.\nPotential inaccuracies or discrepancies in the translation process itself might influence the resultant robustness score, rather than reflect an inherent failing of the model being tested.\nThe test is predominantly language-dependent, hence it might not fully capture the robustness of the model for languages with fewer resources or languages that are highly dissimilar to the source language."

The test does so by introducing random word changes through replacing words in the test dataset with their synonyms.\nTest Mechanism: This test utilizes WordNet to find synonyms for a given word present in the test data, replacing the original word with this synonym based on a given probability. The probability is defined as a parameter and determines the likelihood of swapping a word with its synonym. By default, this is set at 0.02 but can be adjusted based on specific test requirements. This methodology enables an evaluation of how such replacements can affect the model’s performance.\nSigns of High Risk:\n\nThe model’s performance or predictions change significantly after swapping words with their synonyms.\nThe model shows high sensitivity to small perturbations, like modifying the data with synonyms.\nThe embeddings model fails to identify similar meanings between the original words and their synonyms, which means it lacks semantic understanding.\n\nStrengths:\n\nThe test is flexible in its application.

This metric is predominantly used in text analysis — in this case, to determine how closely the predicted text embeddings align with one another.\nTest Mechanism: The implementation starts by computing the cosine similarity between the predicted values of the model’s test dataset. These cosine similarity scores are then plotted on a histogram with 100 bins to visualize the distribution of the scores. The x-axis of the histogram represents the computed Cosine Similarity.\nSigns of High Risk:\n\nIf the cosine similarity scores cluster close to 1 or -1, it may indicate overfitting, as the model’s predictions are almost perfectly aligned.

    "text": "RegressionErrors\nPurpose: This metric is used to measure the performance of a regression model. It gauges the model’s accuracy by computing several error metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Mean Bias Deviation (MBD) on both the training and testing dataset.\nTest Mechanism: The test computes each of the aforementioned metrics. MAE calculates the average of the absolute difference between the true value and the predicted value. MSE squares the difference before averaging it. RMSE then takes the square root of the MSE. MAPE evaluates the average of the absolute difference between true and predicted values divided by the true value, expressed as a percentage. Lastly, MBD is a measure of average bias in the prediction. The results are compared between the training dataset and the testing dataset.\nSigns of High Risk: High values for any of the metrics, or particularly different metric outcomes for the training set versus the test set, are signs of high risk. Specifically, high MAE, MSE, RMSE, or MAPE values could indicate poor model performance and overfitting. If MBD is significantly different from zero, it could signify that the model’s predictions are systematically biased.\nStrengths: These metrics collectively provide a comprehensive view of model performance and error distribution. Individually, MAE provides a linear score that could be more interpretable, while MSE gives more weight to larger errors. RMSE is useful because it is in the same unit as the target variable. MAPE expresses error as a percentage, making it a good measure of prediction accuracy. MBD helps to detect systematic bias in predictions.\nLimitations: Each of these metrics has its own limitations. MAE and MSE are sensitive to outliers. While RMSE is good for giving high weight to larger errors, it might too heavily penalize these errors. MAPE might be biased if actual values are near zero, and MBD would not work well if the difference between predictions and actual values changes with the magnitude of the actual values. Overall, these metrics will not capture all model performance nuances, and they should be used with contextual understanding of the problem at hand."

Specifically, this Python-based test evaluates the R-squared (R2) and Adjusted R-squared (Adj R2) scores: two statistical measures within regression analysis used to evaluate the strength of the relationship between the model’s predictors and the response variable.\nTest Mechanism: The test deploys the ‘r2_score’ method from the Scikit-learn metrics module, measuring the R2 score on both training and test sets. This score reflects the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from independent variables. The test also considers the Adjusted R2 score, accounting for the number of predictors in the model, to penalize model complexity and thus reduce overfitting. The Adjusted R2 score will be smaller if unnecessary predictors are included in the model.\nSigns of High Risk: Indicators of high risk in this test may include a low R2 or Adjusted R2 score, which would suggest that the model does not explain much variation in the dependent variable. The occurrence of overfitting is also a high-risk sign, evident when the R2 score on the training set is significantly higher than on the test set, indicating that the model is not generalizing well to unseen data.\nStrengths: The R2 score is a widely-used measure in regression analysis, providing a sound general indication of model performance. It is easy to interpret and understand, as it is essentially representing the proportion of the dependent variable’s variance explained by the independent variables. The Adjusted R2 score complements the R2 score well by taking into account the number of predictors in the model, which helps control overfitting.\nLimitations: R2 and Adjusted R2 scores can be sensitive to the inclusion of unnecessary predictors in the model (even though Adjusted R2 is intended to penalize complexity). Their reliability might also lessen in cases of non-linear relationships or when the underlying assumptions of linear regression are violated. Additionally, while they summarize how well the model fits the data, they do not provide insight on whether the correct regression was used, or whether certain key assumptions have been fulfilled."

Typically, these would be a development and a validation dataset or two datasets collected at different periods. The PSI provides a measurable indication of any significant shift in the model’s performance over time or noticeable changes in the characteristics of the population the model is making predictions for.\nTest Mechanism: The implementation of the PSI in this script involves calculating the PSI for each feature between the training and test datasets. Data from both datasets is sorted and placed into either a predetermined number of bins or quantiles. The boundaries for these bins are initially determined based on the distribution of the training data. The contents of each bin are calculated and their respective proportions determined. Subsequently, the PSI is derived for each bin through a logarithmic transformation of the ratio of the proportions of data for each feature in the training and test datasets. The PSI, along with the proportions of data in each bin for both datasets, are displayed in a summary table, a grouped bar chart, and a scatter plot.\nSigns of High Risk:\n\nA high PSI value is a clear indicator of high risk. Such a value suggests a significant shift in the model predictions or severe changes in the characteristics of the underlying population.\nThis ultimately suggests that the model may not be performing as well as expected and that it may be less reliable for making future predictions.\n\nStrengths:\n\nThe PSI provides a quantitative measure of the stability of a model over time or across different samples, making it an invaluable tool for evaluating changes in a model’s performance.\nIt allows for direct comparisons across different features based on the PSI value.\nThe calculation and interpretation of the PSI are straightforward, facilitating its use in model risk management.\nThe use of visual aids such as tables and charts further simplifies the comprehension and interpretation of the PSI.\n\nLimitations:\n\nThe PSI test does not account for the interdependence between features: features that are dependent on one another may show similar shifts in their distributions, which in turn may result in similar PSI values.\nThe PSI test does not inherently provide insights into why there are differences in distributions or why the PSI values may have changed.\nThe test may not handle features with significant outliers adequately.\nAdditionally, the PSI test is performed on model predictions, not on the underlying data distributions which can lead to misinterpretations. Any changes in PSI could be due to shifts in the model (model drift), changes in the relationships between features and the target variable (concept drift), or both. However, distinguishing between these causes is non-trivial."

This test gauges the model’s ability to generalize its predictions to new, unseen data and assesses the level of the model’s overfitting on the training set by measuring commonly-used metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\nTest Mechanism: The implementation of this test incorporates various metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics are applied on the model’s predictions of the training set and compared with the true output. The accuracy evaluates the proportion of correct predictions out of the total predictions. Meanwhile, precision measures the accurate positive predictions relative to the total number of positive predictions. The recall metric indicates the proportion of true positive predictions in relation to the overall number of actual positives in the dataset. Lastly, the F1 score represents the harmonic mean of precision and recall, thus providing a comprehensive appraisal of the model’s performance.\nSigns of High Risk: - A near-perfect performance on all metrics on the training data, coupled with inferior performance on unseen data, may be indicative of overfitting. This constitutes a high-risk scenario. - Low values on any of these metrics may signal an underperforming model, posing a potential risk for production-grade applications.\nStrengths: - Using conventional metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score allows for an all-encompassing evaluation of the model’s performance. - The results are interpretable due to the widespread use and understanding of these metrics in the machine learning field. - Being applied to the training set, this test can detect overfitting early in the model’s development stage.\nLimitations: - Although these metrics yield valuable insights, they are susceptible to biases inherent in the training data. - There’s always a chance for disparity between the model’s performance in the training set and performance with new, unseen data. - Therefore, this test should be supplemented with additional validation tactics, such as k-fold cross-validation or out-of-sample testing, to provide a more unbiased evaluation of the model’s performance."

This performance is evaluated based on how well the model is able to correctly classify True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives - fundamental aspects of model accuracy.\nTest Mechanism: The mechanism used involves taking the predicted results (y_test_predict) from the classification model and comparing them against the actual values (y_test_true). A confusion matrix is built using the unique labels extracted from y_test_true, employing scikit-learn’s metrics. The matrix is then visually rendered with the help of Plotly’s create_annotated_heatmap function. A heatmap is created which provides a two-dimensional graphical representation of the model’s performance, showcasing distributions of True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN).\nSigns of High Risk: Indicators of high risk related to the model include: - High numbers of False Positives (FP) and False Negatives (FN), depicting that the model is not effectively classifying the values. - Low numbers of True Positives (TP) and True Negatives (TN), implying that the model is struggling with correctly identifying class labels.\nStrengths: The Confusion Matrix tester brings numerous strengths: - It provides a simplified yet comprehensive visual snapshot of the classification model’s predictive performance. - It distinctly brings out True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN), thus, making it easier to focus on potential areas of improvement. - The matrix is beneficial in dealing with multi-class classification problems as it can provide a simple view of complex model performances. - It aids in understanding the different types of errors that the model could potentially make, as it provides in-depth insights into Type-I and Type-II errors.\nLimitations: Despite its various strengths, the Confusion Matrix tester does exhibit some limitations: - In cases of unbalanced classes, the effectiveness of the confusion matrix might be lessened. It may wrongly interpret the accuracy of a model that is essentially just predicting the majority class. - It does not provide a single unified statistic that could evaluate the overall performance of the model. Different aspects of the model’s performance are evaluated separately instead. - It mainly serves as a descriptive tool and does not offer the capability for statistical hypothesis testing. - Risks of misinterpretation exist because the matrix doesn’t directly provide precision, recall, or F1-score data.

It involves comparing the model’s produced clusters against the actual (true) clusters found in the dataset.\n2. Test Mechanism: The Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) is calculated by using the adjusted_rand_score method from the sklearn metrics in Python. The test requires inputs including the model itself and the model’s training and test datasets. The model’s computed clusters and the true clusters are compared, and the similarities are measured to compute the ARI.\n3.

The metric ranges between -1 and 1, where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters. Thus, the goal is to achieve a high Silhouette Score, implying well-separated clusters.\nTest Mechanism: The test first extracts the true and predicted labels from the model’s training data.

The required inputs to perform this metric are the model, train dataset, and test dataset. The test is appropriate for models tasked with clustering.\n3.

The significance is measured by evaluating the decrease in the model’s performance when the feature’s values are randomly arranged.\nTest Mechanism: PFI is calculated via the permutation_importance method from the sklearn.inspection module. This method shuffles the columns of the feature dataset and measures the impact on the model’s performance. A significant decrease in performance after permutating a feature’s values deems the feature as important. On the other hand, if performance remains the same, the feature is likely not important. The output of the PFI metric is a figure illustrating the importance of each feature.\nSigns of High Risk: - The model heavily relies on a feature with highly variable or easily permutable values, indicating instability. - A feature, deemed unimportant by the model but based on domain knowledge should have a significant effect on the outcome, is not influencing the model’s predictions.\nStrengths: - PFI provides insights into the importance of different features and may reveal underlying data structure. - It can indicate overfitting if a particular feature or set of features overly impacts the model’s predictions. - The metric is model-agnostic and can be used with any classifier that provides a measure of prediction accuracy before and after feature permutation.\nLimitations: - The feature importance calculated does not imply causality, it only presents the amount of information that a feature provides for the prediction task. - The metric does not account for interactions between features. If features are correlated, the permutation importance may allocate importance to one and not the other. - PFI cannot interact with certain libraries like statsmodels, pytorch, catboost, etc, thus limiting its applicability."

It achieves this by comparing the model’s performance on both the training and testing datasets. These datasets are broken down into distinct sections defined by a Feature Space. Areas, where the model underperforms by displaying high residual values or a significant amount of overfitting, are highlighted, prompting actions for mitigation using regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization, Dropout, Early Stopping or data augmentation.\nTest Mechanism: The metric conducts the test by executing the method ‘run’ on the default parameters and metrics with ‘accuracy’ as the specified metric. It segments the feature space by binning crucial feature columns from both the training and testing datasets. Then, the method computes the prediction results for each defined region. Subsequently, the prediction’s efficacy is evaluated, i.e., the model’s performance gap (defined as the discrepancy between the actual and the model’s predictions) for both datasets is calculated and compared with a preset cut-off value for the overfitting condition. A test failure presents an overfit model, whereas a pass signifies a fit model. Meanwhile, the function also prepares figures further illustrating the regions with overfitting.\nSigns of High Risk: Indicators of a high-risk model are: - A high ‘gap’ value indicating discrepancies in the training and testing data accuracy signals an overfit model. - Multiple or vast overfitting zones within the feature space suggest overcomplication of the model.\nStrengths: - Presents a visual perspective by plotting regions with overfit issues, simplifying understanding of the model structure. - Permits a feature-focused assessment, which promotes specific, targeted modifications to the model. - Caters to modifications of the testing parameters such as ‘cut_off_percentage’ and ‘features_column’ enabling a personalized analysis. - Handles both numerical and categorical features.\nLimitations: - Does not currently support regression tasks and is limited to classification tasks only. - Ineffectual for text-based features, which in turn restricts its usage for Natural Language Processing models. - Primarily depends on the bins setting, responsible for segmenting the feature space. Different bin configurations might yield varying results. - Utilization of a fixed cut-off percentage for making overfitting decisions, set arbitrarily, leading to a possible risk of inaccuracy. - Limitation of performance metrics to accuracy alone might prove inadequate for detailed examination, especially for imbalanced datasets."

If this ROC AUC score is higher than the predefined threshold (defaulted to 0.5), the test passes; otherwise, it fails. The results, including the ROC AUC score, the threshold, and whether the test passed or failed, are then stored in a ThresholdTestResult object.\nSigns of High Risk: - A high risk or failure in the model’s performance as related to this metric would be represented by a low ROC AUC score, specifically any score lower than the predefined minimum threshold.

This is done because the assumption of normal distribution plays a vital role in numerous statistical procedures as well as numerous machine learning models. Should the features fail to follow a normal distribution, some model types may not operate at optimal efficiency. This can potentially lead to inaccurate predictions.\nTest Mechanism: The application of this test happens across all feature columns within the training dataset. For each feature, the Lilliefors test returns a test statistic and p-value. The test statistic quantifies how far the feature’s distribution is from an ideal normal distribution, whereas the p-value aids in determining the statistical relevance of this deviation. The final results are stored within a dictionary, the keys of which correspond to the name of the feature column, and the values being another dictionary which houses the test statistic and p-value.\nSigns of High Risk:\n\nIf the p-value corresponding to a specific feature sinks below a pre-established significance level, generally set at 0.05, then it can be deduced that the distribution of that feature significantly deviates from a normal distribution. This can present a high risk for models that assume normality, as these models may perform inaccurately or inefficiently in the presence of such a feature.\n\nStrengths:\n\nOne advantage of the Lilliefors test is its utility irrespective of whether the mean and variance of the normal distribution are known in advance. This makes it a more robust option in real-world situations where these values might not be known.\nSecond, the test has the ability to screen every feature column, offering a holistic view of the dataset.\n\nLimitations:\n\nDespite the practical applications of the Lilliefors test in validating normality, it does come with some limitations.\nFirstly, it is only capable of testing unidimensional data, thus rendering it ineffective for datasets with interactions between features or multi-dimensional phenomena.\nAdditionally, the test might not be as sensitive as some other tests (like the Anderson-Darling test) in detecting deviations from a normal distribution.\nLastly, like any other statistical test, Lilliefors test may also produce false positives or negatives.

Its measurement tools include conventional regression metrics such as R-Squared, Adjusted R-Squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\nTest Mechanism: This test employs the ‘train_ds’ attribute of the model to gather and analyze the training data. Initially, it fetches the independent variables and uses the model to make predictions on these given features. Subsequently, it calculates several standard regression performance metrics including R-Square, Adjusted R-Squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which quantify the approximation of the predicted responses to the actual responses.\nSigns of High Risk: - Low R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squared values. A poor fit between the model predictions and the true responses is indicated by low values of these metrics, suggesting the model explains a small fraction of the variance in the target variable. - High MSE and RMSE values represent a high prediction error and point to poor model performance.\nStrengths: - Offers an extensive evaluation of regression models by combining four key measures of model accuracy and fit. - Provides a comprehensive view of the model’s performance. - Both the R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squared measures are readily interpretable. They represent the proportion of total variation in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables.\nLimitations: - Applicable exclusively to regression models. It is not suited for evaluating binary classification models or time series models, thus limiting its scope. - Although RMSE and MSE are sound measures of prediction error, they might be sensitive to outliers, potentially leading to an overestimation of the model’s prediction error. - A high R-squared or adjusted R-squared may not necessarily indicate a good model, especially in cases where the model is possibly overfitting the data."

    "text": "ADFTest\nAssesses the stationarity of time series data using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.\nPurpose: The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) metric test is designed to evaluate the presence of a unit root in a time series. This essentially translates to assessing the stationarity of a time series dataset. This is vital in time series analysis, regression tasks, and forecasting, as these often need the data to be stationary.\nTest Mechanism: This test application utilizes the “adfuller” function from Python’s “statsmodels” library. It applies this function to each column of the training dataset, subsequently calculating the ADF statistic, p-value, the number of lags used, and the number of observations in the sample for each column. If a column’s p-value is lower than the predetermined threshold (usually 0.05), the series is considered stationary, and the test is deemed passed for that column.\nSigns of High Risk: - A p-value that surpasses the threshold value indicates a high risk or potential model performance issue. - A high p-value suggests that the null hypothesis (of a unit root being present) cannot be rejected. This in turn suggests that the series is non-stationary which could potentially yield unreliable and falsified results for the model’s performance and forecast.\nStrengths: - Archetypal Test for Stationarity: The ADF test is a comprehensive approach towards testing the stationarity of time series data. Such testing is vital for many machine learning and statistical models. - Detailed Output: The function generates detailed output, including the number of lags used and the number of observations, which adds to understanding a series’ behaviour.\nLimitations: - Dependence on Threshold: The result of this test freights heavily on the threshold chosen. Hence, an imprudent threshold value might lead to false acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis. - Not Effective for Trending Data: The test suffers when it operates under the assumption that the data does not encapsulate any deterministic trend. In the presence of such a trend, it might falsely identify a series as non-stationary. - Potential for False Positives: The ADF test especially in the case of larger datasets, tends to reject the null hypothesis, escalating the chances of false positives."

For machine learning models dealing with time series and forecasting, this metric evaluates the existence of a unit root, thereby checking whether a time series is non-stationary. This analysis is a crucial initial step when dealing with time series data.\nTest Mechanism: This code implements the Dickey-Fuller GLS unit root test on each attribute of the dataset. This process involves iterating through every column of the dataset and applying the DFGLS test to assess the presence of a unit root. The resulting information, including the test statistic (‘stat’), the p-value (‘pvalue’), the quantity of lagged differences utilized in the regression (‘usedlag’), and the number of observations (‘nobs’), is subsequently stored.\nSigns of High Risk: - A high p-value for the DFGLS test represents a high risk. Specifically, a p-value above a typical threshold of 0.05 suggests that the time series data is quite likely to be non-stationary, thus presenting a high risk for generating unreliable forecasts.\nStrengths: - The Dickey-Fuller GLS test is a potent tool for checking the stationarity of time series data. - It helps to verify the assumptions of the models before the actual construction of the machine learning models proceeds. - The results produced by this metric offer a clear insight into whether the data is appropriate for specific machine learning models, especially those demanding the stationarity of time series data.\nLimitations: - Despite its benefits, the DFGLS test does present some drawbacks. It can potentially lead to inaccurate conclusions if the time series data incorporates a structural break. - If the time series tends to follow a trend while still being stationary, the test might misinterpret it, necessitating further detrending. - The test also presents challenges when dealing with shorter time series data or volatile data, not producing reliable results in these cases."

Specifically, it calculates and presents three important metrics - the Area under the ROC Curve (AUC), the GINI coefficient, and the Kolmogov-Smirnov (KS) statistic - for both training and test datasets.\nTest Mechanism: Using a dictionary for storing performance metrics for both the training and test datasets, the GINITable’ metric calculates each of these metrics sequentially. The Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) is calculated via the roc_auc_score function from the Scikit-Learn library. The GINI coefficient, a measure of statistical dispersion, is then computed by doubling the AUC and subtracting 1.

These metrics are then stored in a pandas DataFrame for convenient visualization.\nSigns of High Risk: - Low values for performance metrics may suggest a reduction in model performance, particularly a low AUC which indicates poor classification performance, or a low GINI coefficient, which could suggest a decreased ability to discriminate different classes. - A high KS value may be an indicator of potential overfitting, as this generally signifies a substantial divergence between positive and negative distributions. - Significant discrepancies between the performance on the training dataset and the test dataset may present another signal of high risk.\nStrengths: - Offers three key performance metrics (AUC, GINI, and KS) in one test, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of the model. - Provides a direct comparison between the model’s performance on training and testing datasets, which aids in identifying potential underfitting or overfitting. - The applied metrics are class-distribution invariant, thereby remaining effective for evaluating model performance even when dealing with imbalanced datasets. - Presents the metrics in a user-friendly table format for easy comprehension and analysis.\nLimitations: - The GINI coefficient and KS statistic are both dependent on the AUC value. Therefore, any errors in the calculation of the latter will adversely impact the former metrics too. - Mainly suited for binary classification models and may require modifications for effective application in multi-class scenarios. - The metrics used are threshold-dependent and may exhibit high variability based on the chosen cut-off points. - The test does not incorporate a method to efficiently handle missing or inefficiently processed data, which could lead to inaccuracies in the metrics if the data is not appropriately preprocessed."

Specifically, it analyzes runs, sequences of consecutive positives or negatives, in the data to check if there are more or fewer runs than expected under the assumption of randomness. This can be an indication of some pattern, trend, or cycle in the model’s output which may need attention.\nTest Mechanism: The testing mechanism applies the Runs Test from the statsmodels module on each column of the training dataset. For every feature in the dataset, a Runs Test is executed, whose output includes a Runs Statistic and P-value. A low P-value suggests that data arrangement in the feature is not likely to be random. The results are stored in a dictionary where the keys are the feature names, and the values are another dictionary storing the test statistic and the P-value for each feature.\nSigns of High Risk: - High risk is indicated when the P-value is close to zero. - If the p-value is less than a predefined significance level (like 0.05), it suggests that the runs (series of positive or negative values) in the model’s output are not random and are longer or shorter than what is expected under a random scenario. - This would mean there’s a high risk of non-random distribution of errors or model outcomes, suggesting potential issues with the model.\nStrengths: - The strength of the Runs Test is that it’s straightforward and fast for detecting non-random patterns in data sequence. - It can validate assumptions of randomness, which is particularly valuable for checking error distributions in regression models, trendless time series data, and making sure a classifier doesn’t favour one class over another. - Moreover, it can be applied to both classification and regression tasks, making it versatile.\nLimitations: - The test assumes that the data is independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.), which might not be the case for many real-world datasets. - The conclusion drawn from the low p-value indicating non-randomness does not provide information about the type or the source of the detected pattern. - Also, it is sensitive to extreme values (outliers), and overly large or small run sequences can influence the results. - Furthermore, this test does not provide model performance evaluation; it is used to detect patterns in the sequence of outputs only."

It sorts the predicted probabilities of defaults into user-defined rating classes defined in “rating_classes” in default parameters. When it has classified the probabilities, it then calculates the average default rates within each rating class. Subsequently, it produces bar plots for each of these rating classes, illustrating the average likelihood of a default within each class.

It achieves this by contrasting the models’ forecasts with the observed data from the respective training and test datasets. The gauge of accuracy here involves determining the extent of closeness between forecasted and actual values. Accordingly, if any transformations are specified, the metric will handle transforming the data before making this comparison.\nTest Mechanism: The RegressionModelForecastPlotLevels class in Python initiates with a transformation parameter, which default aggregates to None. Initially, the class checks for the presence of model objects and raises a ValueError if none are found. Each model is then processed, creating predictive forecasts for both its training and testing datasets. These forecasts are then contrasted with the actual values and plotted. In situations where a specified transformation, like “integrate,” is specified, the class navigates the transformation steps (performing cumulative sums to generate a novel series, for instance). Finally, plots are produced that compare observed and forecasted values for both the raw and transformed datasets.\nSigns of High Risk: Indications of high risk or failure in the model’s performance can be derived from checking the generated plots. When the forecasted values dramatically deviate from the observed values in either the training or testing datasets, it suggests a high risk situation. A significant deviation could be a symptom of either overfitting or underfitting, both scenarios are worrying. Such discrepancies could inhibit the model’s ability to create precise, generalized results.\nStrengths:\n\nVisual Evaluations: The metric provides a visual and comparative way of assessing multiple regression models at once. This allows easier interpretation and evaluation of their forecasting accuracy.\nTransformation Handling: This metric can handle transformations like “integrate,” enhancing its breadth and flexibility in evaluating different models.\nDetailed Perspective: By looking at the performance on both datasets (training and testing), the metric may give a detailed overview of the model.\n\nLimitations:\n\nSubjectivity: Relying heavily on visual interpretations; assessments may differ from person to person.\nLimited Transformation Capability: Currently, only the “integrate” transformation is supported, implying complex transformations might go unchecked or unhandled.\nOverhead: The plotting mechanism may become computationally costly when applying to extensive datasets, increasing runtime.\nNumerical Measurement: Although visualization is instrumental, a corresponding numerical measure would further reinforce the observations.

It’s designed to test for stationarity, a crucial aspect in time series analysis where data points are not dependent on time. Stationarity means that the statistical properties such as mean, variance and autocorrelation are all constant over time.\nTest Mechanism: The Zivot-Andrews unit root test is performed on each feature in the dataset using the ZivotAndrews function from the arch.unitroot module. This function returns the Zivot-Andrews metric for each feature, which includes the statistical value, p-value (probability value), the number of used lags, and the number of observations. The p-value is later used to decide on the null hypothesis (the time series has a unit root and is non-stationary) based on a chosen level of significance.\nSigns of High Risk: - A high p-value can suggest high risk.

By doing so, it analyzes the effects of each independent variable on the dependent variable within the regression model and helps identify significant risk factors that could substantially influence the model’s output.\nTest Mechanism: This metric operates by initially applying shocks of varying magnitudes, defined by specific parameters, to each of the model’s features, one at a time. With all other variables held constant, a new prediction is made for each dataset subjected to shocks. Any changes in the model’s predictions are directly attributed to the shocks applied. In the event that the transformation parameter is set to “integrate”, initial predictions and target values undergo transformation via an integration function before being plotted. Lastly, a plot demonstrating observed values against predicted values for each model is generated, showcasing a distinct line graph illustrating predictions for each shock.\nSigns of High Risk: - If the plot exhibits drastic alterations in model predictions consequent to minor shocks to an individual variable, it may indicate high risk. This underscores potentially high model sensitivity to changes in that variable, suggesting over-dependence on that variable for predictions. - Unusually high or unpredictable shifts in response to shocks may also denote potential model instability or overfitting.\nStrengths: - The metric allows identification of variables strongly influencing the model outcomes, paving the way for understanding feature importance. - It generates visual plots which make the results easily interpretable even to non-technical stakeholders. - Beneficial in identifying overfitting and detecting unstable models that over-react to minor changes in variables.\nLimitations: - The metric operates on the assumption that all other variables remain unchanged during the application of a shock. However, real-world situations where variables may possess intricate interdependencies may not always reflect this. - It is best compatible with linear models and may not effectively evaluate the sensitivity of non-linear model configurations. - The metric does not provide a numerical risk measure.

These include: - Significant discrepancies observed between the histograms of training and testing data. - Large disparities between the histograms for the positive and negative classes. - These issues could signal potential overfitting or bias in the model. - Unevenly distributed probabilities may also indicate that the model does not accurately predict outcomes.\nStrengths: This metric and test offer several benefits, including: - The visual representation of the PD predictions made by the model, which aids in understanding the model’s behaviour. - The ability to assess both the training and testing datasets, adding depth to the validation of the model. - Highlighting disparities between multiple classes, providing potential insights into class imbalance or data skewness issues. - Particularly beneficial for credit risk prediction, it effectively visualizes the spread of risk across different classes.\nLimitations: Despite its strengths, the test has several limitations: - It is specifically tailored for binary classification scenarios, where the target variable only has two classes; as such, it isn’t suited for multi-class classification tasks. - This metric is mainly applicable for logistic regression models. It might not be effective or accurate when used on other model types. - While the test provides a robust visual representation of the model’s PD predictions, it does not provide a quantifiable measure or score to assess model performance."

This is especially significant for forecasting-based models, where understanding the seasonality component can drastically improve prediction accuracy.\nTest Mechanism: This metric uses the seasonal decomposition method from the Statsmodels Python library.

By showcasing the data distribution across different categories of each feature, it aids in understanding each variable’s predictive power in the context of a classification-based machine learning model. Commonly used in credit scoring models, WoE and IV are robust statistical methods for evaluating a variable’s predictive power.\nTest Mechanism: The test implementation follows defined steps.

    "text": "AutoStationarity\nAutomates Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to assess stationarity across multiple time series in a DataFrame.\nPurpose: The AutoStationarity metric is intended to automatically detect and evaluate the stationary nature of each time series in a DataFrame. It incorporates the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, a statistical approach used to assess stationarity. Stationarity is a fundamental property suggesting that statistic features like mean and variance remain unchanged over time. This is necessary for many time-series models.\nTest Mechanism: The mechanism for the AutoStationarity test involves applying the Augmented Dicky-Fuller test to each time series within the given dataframe to assess if they are stationary. Every series in the dataframe is looped, using the ADF test up to a defined maximum order (configurable and by default set to 5). The p-value resulting from the ADF test is compared against a predetermined threshold (also configurable and by default set to 0.05). The time series is deemed stationary at its current differencing order if the p-value is less than the threshold.\nSigns of High Risk: - A significant number of series not achieving stationarity even at the maximum order of differencing can indicate high risk or potential failure in the model. - This could suggest the series may not be appropriately modeled by a stationary process, hence other modeling approaches might be required.\nStrengths: - The key strength in this metric lies in the automation of the ADF test, enabling mass stationarity analysis across various time series and boosting the efficiency and credibility of the analysis. - The utilization of the ADF test, a widely accepted method for testing stationarity, lends authenticity to the results derived. - The introduction of the max order and threshold parameters give users the autonomy to determine their preferred levels of stringency in the tests.\nLimitations: - The Augumented Dicky-Fuller test and the stationarity test are not without their limitations. These tests are premised on the assumption that the series can be modeled by an autoregressive process, which may not always hold true. - The stationarity check is highly sensitive to the choice of threshold for the significance level; an extremely high or low threshold could lead to incorrect results regarding the stationarity properties. - There’s also a risk of over-differencing if the maximum order is set too high, which could induce unnecessary cycles."

    "text": "Skewness\nEvaluates the skewness of numerical data in a machine learning model and checks if it falls below a set maximum threshold.\nPurpose: The purpose of the Skewness test is to measure the asymmetry in the distribution of data within a predictive machine learning model. Specifically, it evaluates the divergence of said distribution from a normal distribution. In understanding the level of skewness, we can potentially identify issues with data quality, an essential component for optimizing the performance of traditional machine learning models in both classification and regression settings.\nTest Mechanism: This test calculates skewness of numerical columns in a dataset, which is extracted from the DataFrame, specifically focusing on numerical data types. The skewness value is then contrasted against a predetermined maximum threshold, set by default to 1. The skewness value under review is deemed to have passed the test only if it is less than this maximum threshold; otherwise, the test is considered ‘fail’. Subsequently, the test results of each column, together with the skewness value and column name, are cached.\nSigns of High Risk:\n\nThe presence of substantial skewness levels that significantly exceed the maximum threshold is an indication of skewed data distribution and subsequently high model risk.\nPersistent skewness in data could signify that the foundational assumptions of the machine learning model may not be applicable, potentially leading to subpar model performance, erroneous predictions, or biased inferences.\n\nStrengths:\n\nFast and efficient identification of unequal data\ndistributions within a machine learning model is enabled by the skewness test.\nThe maximum threshold parameter can be adjusted to meet the user’s specific needs, enhancing the test’s versatility.\n\nLimitations:\n\nThe test only evaluates numeric columns, which means that data in non-numeric columns could still include bias or problematic skewness that this test does not capture.\nThe test inherently assumes that the data should follow a normal distribution, an expectation which may not always be met in real-world data.\nThe risk grading is largely dependent on a subjective threshold, which may result in excessive strictness or leniency depending upon selection. This factor might require expert input and recurrent iterations for refinement."

The purpose of this exercise is crucial in the pre-processing of data as outliers can substantially distort the statistical analysis and debilitate the performance of machine learning models.\nTest Mechanism: The IQR, which is the range separating the first quartile (25th percentile) from the third quartile (75th percentile), is calculated for each numerical feature within the dataset. An outlier is defined as a data point falling below the “Q1 - 1.5 * IQR” or above “Q3 + 1.5 * IQR” range. The metric then computes the number of outliers along with their minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum values for each numerical feature. If no specific features are chosen, the metric will apply to all numerical features in the dataset. The default outlier threshold is set to 1.5, following the standard definition of outliers in statistical analysis, although it can be customized by the user.\nSigns of High Risk: - High risk is indicated by a large number of outliers in multiple features. - Outliers that are significantly distanced from the mean value of variables could potentially signal high risk. - Data entry errors or other data quality issues could be manifested through extremely high or low outlier values.\nStrengths: - It yields a comprehensive summary of outliers for each numerical feature within the dataset. This enables the user to pinpoint features with potential quality issues. - The IQR method is not overly affected by extremely high or low outlier values as it is based on quartile calculations. - The versatility of this metric grants the ability to customize the method to work on selected features and set a defined threshold for outliers.\nLimitations: - The metric might cause false positives if the variable of interest veers away from a normal or near-normal distribution, notably in the case of skewed distributions. - It does not extend to provide interpretation or recommendations for tackling outliers and relies on the user or a data scientist to conduct further analysis of the results. - As it only functions on numerical features, it cannot be used for categorical data. - For data that has undergone heavy pre-processing, was manipulated, or inherently possesses a high kurtosis (heavy tails), the pre-set threshold may not be optimal for outlier detection."

The goal is to identify common trends and patterns in the use of hashtags, which can serve as critical indicators or features within a machine learning model.\nTest Mechanism: The test implements a regular expression (regex) to extract all hashtags from the specified text column.

The results are also visualized in a bar plot, with frequency counts on the y-axis and the corresponding hashtags on the x-axis.\nSigns of High Risk: - A low diversity in the usage of hashtags, as indicated by a few hashtags being used disproportionately more than others. - Repeated usage of one or few hashtags can be indicative of spam or a biased dataset. - If there are no or extremely few hashtags found in the dataset, it perhaps signifies that the text data does not contain structured social media data.\nStrengths: - It provides a concise visual representation of the frequency of hashtags, which can be critical for understanding trends about a particular topic in text data. - It is instrumental in tasks specifically related to social media text analytics, such as opinion analysis and trend discovery. - The test is adaptable, allowing the flexibility to determine the number of top hashtags to be analyzed.\nLimitations: - The test assumes the presence of hashtags and therefore may not be applicable for text datasets that do not contain hashtags (e.g., formal documents, scientific literature). - Language-specific limitations of hashtag formulations are not taken into account. - It does not account for typographical errors, variations, or synonyms in hashtags. - This test does not provide context or sentiment associated with the hashtags, so the information provided may have limited utility on its own."

The primary objective is to identify and calculate the frequency of ‘mentions’ within a chosen text column of a dataset. A ‘mention’ in this context refers to individual text elements that are prefixed by ‘@’. The output of this test reveals the most frequently mentioned entities or usernames, which can be integral for applications such as social media analyses, customer sentiment analyses, and so on.\nTest Mechanism: The test first verifies the existence of a text column in the provided dataset. It then employs a regular expression pattern to extract mentions from the text. Subsequently, the frequency of each unique mention is calculated. The test selects the most frequent mentions based on default or user-defined parameters, the default being the top 25, for representation. This process of thresholding forms the core of the test. A treemap plot visualizes the test results, where the size of each rectangle corresponds to the frequency of a particular mention.\nSigns of High Risk: - The lack of a valid text column in the dataset, which would result in the failure of the test execution. - The absence of any mentions within the text data, indicating that there might not be any text associated with @’. This situation could point towards sparse or poor-quality data, thereby hampering the model’s generalization or learning capabilities.\nStrengths: - The test is specifically optimized for text-based datasets which gives it distinct power in the context of NLP. - It enables quick identification and visually appealing representation of the predominant elements or mentions. - It can provide crucial insights about the most frequently mentioned entities or usernames.\nLimitations: - The test only recognizes mentions that are prefixed by ‘@’, hence useful textual aspects not preceded by ’@ might be ignored. - This test isn’t suited for datasets devoid of textual data. - It does not provide insights on less frequently occurring data or outliers, which means potentially significant patterns could be overlooked."

Each unique punctuation character in the text corpus is then tallied. Then, the frequency distribution of each punctuation symbol is visualized as a bar graph, with these results being stored as Figures and associated with the main Punctuations object.\n3.

The purpose of these statistics lies in comprehending the nature of the data, identifying anomalies, and grasping the extent to which the data fulfills model assumptions.\nTest Mechanism: The testing function commences by morphing the input dataset back to its primary form by undoing any one-hot encoding, subsequently extracting each field from the dataset. Post this process, the script computes the descriptive statistics for each field, contingent on its data type (Numeric, Categorical, Boolean, Dummy, Text, Null). For numeric fields, the statistics include computations of mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and varying percentiles. For categorical and boolean fields, the frequency counts of each category along with the most frequent category (or ‘top’) are computed.

It focuses on seeking out duplication in a specified text column or among the primary keys of the data set, which could have serious implications for the performance and integrity of the model. Duplicate entries could potentially skew the data distribution and influence model training inaccurately.\nTest Mechanism: This test operates by calculating the total number of duplicate entries in the data set. The algorithm will count duplicates within the ‘text_column’ if this property is specified. If primary keys are defined, the test will also be applied on them. The count of duplicates (‘n_duplicates’) is then compared to a predefined minimum threshold (the default ‘min_threshold’ is set at 1) to determine whether the test has passed or not. The results include the total number of duplicates as well as the percentage of duplicate rows in comparison to the overall dataset (‘p_duplicates’).\nSigns of High Risk: - A large amount of duplicates, particularly those exceeding the predefined minimum threshold, point toward a high risk situation. - Overrepresentation of certain data which can lead to skewed results. - Indication of inefficient data collecting techniques leading to data redundancy. - Models that fail this test predominantly may necessitate a closer examination of their data preprocessing methods or source data.\nStrengths: - The Duplicates test is highly adaptable, being capable of being used with both text data and tabular data formats. - It is able to provide results both numerically and as a percentage of the total data set, allowing for a broader understanding of the extent of duplication. - Its utility lies in effectively flagging any data quality issues that could potentially upset model performance and generate erroneous predictions.\nLimitations: - The Duplicates test solely targets exact duplication in entries, meaning it may overlook near-duplicates or normalized forms of entries that might also affect data distribution and model integrity. - Data variations caused by errors, phrasing changes, or inconsistencies may not be detected. - A substantial number of duplicates in a datasets may not always denote poor data quality, as this can be dependent on the nature of the data and the problem being addressed."

The rolling mean provides an understanding of the average trend in the data, while the rolling standard deviation gauges the volatility of the data within the window.

Then, the calculated rolling mean and standard deviation are visualized via separate plots, illustrating the trends and volatility in the dataset.

This may not accurately capture patterns in datasets where different features may require different optimal window sizes. - Requires the dataset to be indexed by date and time, hence it may not be useable for datasets without a timestamp index. - Primarily serves for data visualization as it does not facilitate any quantitative measures for stationarity, such as through statistical tests.

The outcome for each feature - comprising the variable name, Chi-squared statistic, p-value, threshold, and pass/fail status - is incorporated into a final summary table.\nSigns of High Risk: - High p-values (greater than the set threshold) for specific variables could indicate a high risk. - These high p-values allude to the absence of a statistically significant relationship between the feature and the target variables, resulting in a ‘Fail’ status. - A categorical feature lacking a relevant association with the target variable could be a warning that the machine learning model might not be performing optimally.\nStrengths: - The test allows for a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between a model’s input features and the target output, thus validating the relevance of categorical features. - It also produces an unambiguous ‘Pass/Fail’ output for each categorical feature. - The opportunity to adjust the p-value threshold contributes to flexibility in accommodating different statistical standards.\nLimitations: - The metric presupposes that data is tabular and categorical, which may not always be the case with all datasets. - It is distinctively designed for classification tasks, hence unsuitable for regression scenarios. - The Chi-squared test, akin to any hypothesis testing-based test, cannot identify causal relationships, but only associations. - Furthermore, the test hinges on an adjustable p-value threshold, and varying threshold selections might lead to different conclusions regarding feature relevance."

    "text": "TabularNumericalHistograms\nGenerates histograms for each numerical feature in a dataset to provide visual insights into data distribution and detect potential issues.\nPurpose: The purpose of this test is to provide visual analysis of numerical data through the generation of histograms for each numerical feature in the dataset. Histograms aid in the exploratory analysis of data, offering insight into the distribution of the data, skewness, presence of outliers, and central tendencies. It helps in understanding if the inputs to the model are normally distributed which is a common assumption in many machine learning algorithms.\nTest Mechanism: This test scans the provided dataset and extracts all the numerical columns. For each numerical column, it constructs a histogram using plotly, with 50 bins. The deployment of histograms offers a robust visual aid, ensuring unruffled identification and understanding of numerical data distribution patterns.\nSigns of High Risk:\n\nA high degree of skewness\nUnexpected data distributions\nExistence of extreme outliers in the histograms These may indicate issues with the data that the model is receiving. If data for a numerical feature is expected to follow a certain distribution (like normal distribution) but does not, it could lead to sub-par performance by the model. As such these instances should be treated as high-risk indicators.\n\nStrengths:\n\nThis test provides a simple, easy-to-interpret visualization of how data for each numerical attribute is distributed.\nIt can help detect skewed values and outliers, that could potentially harm the AI model’s performance.\nIt can be applied to large datasets and multiple numerical variables conveniently.\n\nLimitations:\n\nThis test only works with numerical data, thus ignoring non-numerical or categorical data.\nIt does not analyze relationships between different features, only the individual feature distributions.\nIt is a univariate analysis, and may miss patterns or anomalies that only appear when considering multiple variables together.\nIt does not provide any insight into how these features affect the output of the model; it is purely an input analysis tool."

For numerical data, it gathers statistics such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values, as well as certain percentiles. For categorical data, it calculates the count, number of unique values, most frequent value, frequency of the most common value, and the proportion of the most frequent value relative to the total. This metric aids in visualizing the overall distribution of the variables in the dataset, which in turn assists in understanding the model's behavior and predicting its performance. **Test Mechanism**: The test mechanism involves using the describe() function for numerical fields which computes several summary statistics and value_counts() for categorical fields which counts unique values. Both of these functions are built-in methods of pandas dataframes. The results are then formatted to create two separate tables, one for numerical and one for categorical variable summaries. These tables provide a clear summary of the main characteristics of these variables, which can be crucial in assessing the model's performance. **Signs of High Risk**: High risks can be found in evidence of skewed data or notable outliers. This could be reflected in the mean and median (50% percentile) having a significant difference, in the case of numerical data. For categorical data, high risk can be indicated by a lack of diversity (low count of unique values), or overdominance of a single category (high frequency of the top value). **Strengths**: The primary strength of this metric lies in its ability to provide a comprehensive summary of the dataset, providing insights on the distribution and characteristics of the variables under consideration. It is a flexible and robust method, relevant to both numerical and categorical data. It can help highlight anomalies such as outliers, extreme skewness, or lack of diversity which can be essential in understanding model behavior during testing and validation. **Limitations**: While this metric provides a high-level overview of the data, it may not be sufficient to detect subtle correlations or complex patterns in the data. It does not provide any info on the relationship between variables. Plus, descriptive statistics alone cannot be used to infer properties about future unseen data. It should be used in conjunction with other statistical tests to provide a thorough understanding of the model's data.\n\n\nTest Type:\nMetric\n\n\nRequired

By examining these influences, we can optimize the model's performance and mitigate unintended biases in its responses. **Test Mechanism:** 1. **Distribution of Exemplars:** Check how varying the number of positive vs. negative examples in a prompt impacts the LLM's classification of a neutral or ambiguous statement. 2. **Order of Exemplars:** Examine if the sequence in which positive and negative examples are presented can sway the LLM's response. For each test case, an LLM is used to grade the input prompt on a scale from 1 to 10, based on whether the examples in the prompt may lead to biased responses. A minimum threshold must be met in order for the test to pass. By default, this threshold is set to 7, but it can be adjusted as needed via the test parameters.\nvalidmind.prompt_validation.Bias\n\n\nThresholdTest\nClarity\n**Purpose:** The Clarity Evaluation is designed to assess whether prompts provided to a Large Language Model (LLM) are unmistakably clear in their instructions. With clear prompts, the LLM is better suited to more accurately and effectively interpret and respond to instructions in the prompt **Test Mechanism:** Using an LLM, prompts are scrutinized for clarity, considering aspects like detail inclusion, persona adoption, step-by-step instructions, use of examples, and desired output length. Each prompt is graded on a scale from 1 to 10 based on its clarity. Prompts scoring at or above a predetermined threshold (default is 7) are marked as clear. This threshold can be adjusted via the test parameters. **Why Clarity Matters:** Clear prompts minimize the room for misinterpretation, allowing the LLM to generate more relevant and accurate responses. Ambiguous or vague instructions might leave the model guessing, leading to suboptimal outputs. **Tactics for Ensuring Clarity that will be referenced during evaluation:** 1. **Detail Inclusion:** Provide essential details or context to prevent the LLM from making assumptions. 2. **Adopt a Persona:** Use system messages to specify the desired persona for the LLM's responses. 3. **Specify Steps:** For certain tasks, delineate the required steps explicitly, helping the model in sequential understanding. 4. **Provide Examples:** While general instructions are efficient, in some scenarios, \"few-shot\" prompting or style examples can guide the LLM more effectively. 5. **Determine Output Length:** Define the targeted length of the response, whether in terms of paragraphs, bullet points, or other units. While word counts aren't always precise, specifying formats like paragraphs can offer more predictable results.\nvalidmind.prompt_validation.Clarity\n\n\nThresholdTest\nSpecificity\n**Purpose:** The Specificity Test aims to assess the clarity, precision, and effectiveness of prompts provided to a Large Language Model (LLM). Ensuring specificity in the prompts given to an LLM can significantly influence the accuracy and relevance of its outputs. The goal of this test is to ascertain that the instructions in a prompt are unmistakably clear and relevant, eliminating ambiguity and steering the LLM toward desired outcomes. **Test Mechanism:** Utilizing an LLM, each prompt is graded on a specificity scale ranging from 1 to 10. The grade reflects how well the prompt adheres to principles of clarity, detail, and relevancy without being overly verbose. Prompts that achieve a grade equal to or exceeding a predefined threshold (default set to 7) are deemed to pass the evaluation, while those falling below are marked as failing. This threshold can be adjusted as needed. **Why Specificity Matters:** Prompts that are detailed and descriptive often yield better and more accurate results from an LLM. Rather than relying on specific keywords or tokens, it's crucial to have a well-structured and descriptive prompt. Including relevant examples within the prompt can be particularly effective, guiding the LLM to produce outputs in desired formats. However, it's essential to strike a balance. While prompts need to be detailed, they shouldn't be overloaded with unnecessary information. The emphasis should always be on relevancy and conciseness, considering there are limitations to how long a prompt can be. **Example:** Imagine wanting an LLM to extract specific details from a given text. A vague prompt might yield varied results. However, with a prompt like, \"Extract the names of all characters and the cities they visited from the text\", the LLM is guided more precisely towards the desired information extraction.\nvalidmind.prompt_validation.Specificity\n\n\nThresholdTest\nRobustness\n**Purpose:** The Robustness Integrity Assessment evaluates the resilience and reliability of prompts provided to a Large Language Model (LLM). The primary objective is to ensure that prompts consistently produce accurate and desired outputs, even in diverse or challenging scenarios. **Test Mechanism:** Prompts are subjected to various conditions, alterations, and contexts to check their stability in eliciting consistent responses from the LLM. Factors such as different phrasings, inclusion of potential distractors, and varied input complexities are introduced to test the robustness of the prompt. By default, the test generates 10 inputs for the prompt but this can be adjusted via the test parameters. **Why Robustness Matters:** A robust prompt ensures consistent performance and reduces the likelihood of unexpected or off-tangent outputs. This consistency is vital for applications where predictability and reliability of the LLM's response are paramount.\nvalidmind.prompt_validation.Robustness\n\n\nThresholdTest\nNegative Instruction\n**Purpose:** The Positive Instructional Assessment evaluates prompts provided to a Large Language Model (LLM) to ensure they are framed using affirmative and proactive language. By focusing on what should be done rather than what should be avoided, prompts can guide the LLM more effectively towards generating appropriate and desired outputs. **Test Mechanism:** Employing an LLM as an evaluator, each prompt is meticulously analyzed and graded on use of positive instructions on a scale from 1 to 10. The grade indicates how well the prompt employs affirmative language while avoiding negative or prohibitive instructions. Prompts that achieve a grade equal to or exceeding a predetermined threshold (default set to 7) are recognized as adhering to positive instruction best practices. This threshold can be adjusted via the test parameters. **Why Positive Instructions Matter:** Prompts that are phrased in the affirmative, emphasizing what to do, tend to direct the LLM more clearly than those that focus on what not to do. Negative instructions can lead to ambiguities and undesired model responses. By emphasizing clarity and proactive guidance, we optimize the chances of obtaining relevant and targeted responses from the LLM. **Example:** Consider a scenario involving a chatbot designed to recommend movies. An instruction framed as, \"Don't recommend movies that are horror or thriller\" might cause the LLM to fixate on the genres mentioned, inadvertently producing undesired results. On the other hand, a positively-framed prompt like, \"Recommend family-friendly movies or romantic comedies\" provides clear guidance on the desired output.\nvalidmind.prompt_validation.NegativeInstruction\n\n\nThresholdTest\nConciseness\n**Purpose:** The Conciseness Assessment is designed to evaluate the brevity and succinctness of prompts provided to a Large Language Model (LLM). A concise prompt strikes a balance between offering clear instructions and eliminating redundant or unnecessary information, ensuring that the LLM receives relevant input without being overwhelmed. **Test Mechanism:** Using an LLM, this test puts input prompts through a conciseness analysis where it's graded on a scale from 1 to 10. The grade reflects how well the prompt maintains clarity while avoiding verbosity. Prompts that achieve a grade equal to or surpassing a predefined threshold (default set to 7) are considered successful in being concise. This threshold can be adjusted based on specific requirements. **Why Conciseness Matters:** While detailed prompts can guide an LLM towards accurate results, excessive details can clutter the instruction and potentially lead to undesired outputs. Concise prompts are straightforward, reducing ambiguity and focusing the LLM's attention on the primary task. This is especially important considering there are limitations to the length of prompts that can be fed to an LLM. **Example:** For an LLM tasked with summarizing a document, a verbose prompt might introduce unnecessary constraints or biases. A concise, effective prompt like, \"Provide a brief summary highlighting the main points of the document\" ensures that the LLM captures the essence of the content without being sidetracked.\nvalidmind.prompt_validation.Conciseness\n\n\nThresholdTest\nDelimitation\n**Purpose:** The Delimitation Test ensures that prompts provided to the Large Language Model (LLM) use delimiters correctly to distinctly mark sections of the input. Properly delimited prompts simplify the LLM's interpretation process, ensuring accurate and precise responses. **Test Mechanism:** Using an LLM, prompts are checked for their appropriate use of delimiters such as triple quotation marks, XML tags, and section titles. Each prompt receives a score from 1 to 10 based on its delimitation integrity. Prompts scoring at or above a set threshold (default is 7) pass the check. This threshold can be modified as needed. **Why Proper Delimitation Matters:** Delimiters play a crucial role in segmenting and organizing prompts, especially when diverse data or multiple tasks are involved. They help in clearly distinguishing between different parts of the input, reducing ambiguity for the LLM. As task complexity increases, the correct use of delimiters becomes even more critical to ensure the LLM understands the prompt's intent. **Example:** When given a prompt like: ```USER: Summarize the text delimited by triple quotes. '''insert text here'''``` or: ```USER:\ninsert first article here\ninsert second article here\n``` The LLM can more accurately discern sections of the text to be treated differently, thanks to the clear delimitation.\nvalidmind.prompt_validation.Delimitation\n\n\nMetric\nBert Score\n**Purpose**: BERTScore is a metric used to evaluate the quality of text generation models, focusing on the similarity between the reference text and the generated text. It leverages the contextual embeddings from BERT models to evaluate the similarity of the contents. Therefore, it distinctively measures how well a model has learned and can generate context-relevant results. **Test Mechanism**: This metric derives the true values from the model's testing set and the model's predictions. BERTScore evaluates the precision, recall, and F1 score of the model according to the contextual similarity between the reference and the generated text. These scores are calculated for each token in the candidate sentences as compared to the reference sentences, taking into account cosine similarity with BERT embeddings. A line plot is generated for each metric (Precision, Recall and F1 Score), which visualizes the score changes across row indexes. **Signs of High Risk**: If there's a general downward trend in Precision, Recall, or F1 Score or any noticeable instability/fluctuation in these metrics, it indicates high risk. A low Precision implies that predictions often include irrelevant contexts. A low Recall implies the models miss relevant contexts in predictions. A low F1 score indicates poor overall performance in both precision and recall. **Strengths**: BERTScore is potent in detecting the quality of text that requires understanding the context, which is a typical demand in natural language processing tasks. This metric goes beyond simple n-gram matching and considers the semantic similarity in the context, which provides more meaningful evaluation results. The visualization allows observing the performance trends across different sets of predictions. **Limitations**: BERTScore is dependent on BERT model embeddings; therefore, if the base BERT model is not well-suited for a specific task, it may impact the accuracy of BERTScore. In addition, although good at semantic understanding, it might not capture some nuances in text similarity that other metrics like BLEU or ROUGE can detect. Finally, it can be computationally expensive due to the use of BERT embeddings.\nvalidmind.model_validation.BertScore\n\n\nMetric\nBleu Score\n**Purpose**: The Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) metric measures the quality of machine-translated text by comparing it to human-translated text. This comparison is done at the sentence level and is designed to bring machine translations closer to the quality of a professional human translation. It is commonly used in the field of translation evaluation, and its purpose is to assess the accuracy of a model's output against that of a benchmark. **Test Mechanism**: The implementation of the BLEU score involves using the NLTK's word_tokenize function to split the text into individual words, upon which the BLEU score can be calculated. The method employs the evaluate library's BLEU metric to compute the BLEU score for each translated sentence, comparing the model's translations (predictions) against the actual, correct translations (references). The results are returned as a single score which indicates the average 'distance' between the generated translations and the human translations across the entire test set. **Signs of High Risk**: Low BLEU scores indicate high model risk. This occurs when there is a significant discrepancy between the machine translation and its human equivalent. This may be due to the model not learning effectively, overfitting the training data, or not handling the nuances of the language effectively. Machine bias toward a certain language style or mode of translation can also result in lower scores. **Strengths**: The main strength of the BLEU score is its simplicity and interpretability. It provides an intuitive way to assess the quality of translated texts that can correlate well with human judgements. Additionally, it operates at a granular level (sentence level), enabling more precise assessment of errors. Lastly, it encapsulates the performance of the model with a single, comprehensive score that is easy to compare and monitor. **Limitations**: The BLEU score places emphasis on exact matches, which can lead to bias in favor of literal translations. As a result, it may not fully capture the quality of more complex or flexible translations that don't adhere strictly to a word-for-word structure. Another limitation is that it doesn't directly evaluate the intelligibility or grammatical correctness of the translations. Moreover, it may not identify errors that arise from subtle nuances in language, cultural contexts, or ambiguities.\nvalidmind.model_validation.BleuScore\n\n\nMetric\nContextual Recall\n**Purpose**: The Contextual Recall metric is utilized to gauge the proficiency of a natural language generation (NLG) model in crafting textual content that remains coherent and consistent with the presented context or prompt. It quantifies the model's aptitude to recollect and mirror the foundational context in its resultant output. In the realm of NLP tasks, it's paramount that models generate text reflecting contextual relevance. **Test Mechanism**: 1. **Prepare Reference and Candidate Texts**: - **Reference Texts**: Gather your reference text(s) which epitomize the expected or ideal output for a designated context or prompt. - **Candidate Texts**: Using the same context, generate candidate text(s) from the NLG model under evaluation. 2. **Tokenization and Preprocessing**: - Tokenize both the reference and candidate texts into discernible words or tokens, using established libraries like NLTK. 3. **Compute Contextual Recall**: - Ascertain the overlap of tokens between the reference and candidate texts. - The Contextual Recall score is deduced by dividing the number of overlapping tokens by the total token count of the reference text. The assessment is made for each test dataset instance, resulting in an array of scores. This series of scores is then illustrated via a line plot, showing score variations across rows. **Signs of High Risk**: Low contextual recall scores are red flags. They imply that the model isn't efficiently echoing the original context in its generated content, culminating in outputs that are incoherent or contextually off-track. A persistent trend of low recall scores could presage model underperformance. **Strengths**: The standout attribute of the contextual recall metric is its ability to quantifiably gauge a model's adherence to, and recollection of, both the context and factual elements in the generated narrative. This proves invaluable in applications demanding profound context comprehension, such as text continuation or interactive dialogue systems. The accompanying line plot visualization offers a lucid and intuitive representation of score variations. **Limitations**: Although potent, the Contextual Recall metric might not holistically represent all dimensions of NLG model performance. Its predominant focus on word overlap might award high scores to texts that employ numerous common words, even if they lack coherence or meaningful context. It also bypasses the significance of word order, which might lead to inflated scores for scrambled outputs. Lastly, infrequent words, despite being used aptly, might not match as often, potentially undervaluing models proficient in their application.\nvalidmind.model_validation.ContextualRecall\n\n\nMetric\nRouge Metrics\n**Purpose**: ROUGE, or Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation, serves as a robust metric framework aimed at evaluating the caliber of machine-generated text. Especially pertinent in the arena of natural language generation tasks, such as text summarization, machine translation, and text generation, its overarching goal is to ascertain how effectively the machine-rendered text mirrors key information and concepts present in reference human-crafted text. Owing to its efficacy, the ROUGE metrics have become staples in the NLP community for the assessment of text generation systems. **Test Mechanism**: 1. **Comparison Basis**: At its core, ROUGE operates by juxtaposing machine-generated content with a reference human-constructed text. 2. **Incorporated Metrics**: - **ROUGE-N (N-gram Overlap)**: Focuses on the alignment of n-grams (sequential sets of n words) between the generated and reference texts. Typical n-values include 1 (unigrams), 2 (bigrams), and 3 (trigrams). Each metric calculates precision, recall, and F1-score components. - **ROUGE-L (Longest Common Subsequence)**: Pinpoints the most extended shared word sequence present in both the machine and reference texts, assessing the generated text's ability to encapsulate pivotal phrases. - **ROUGE-S (Skip-bigram)**: Measures the concurrence of skip-bigrams, which are word pairings appearing within a designated word window in the text. This metric is sensitive to word ordering but tolerates sporadic word omissions. 3. **Visual Representation**: The determined precision, recall, and F1-score for each metric are plotted visually, ensuring streamlined comprehension of the results. **Signs of High Risk**: Warning signs under this metric umbrella encompass low scores across the ROUGE suite. A diminished precision could insinuate the presence of redundant information in machine-produced text, while a low recall might denote the omission of salient data from the reference text. A decreased F1 score pinpoints a suboptimal harmony between precision and recall. Persistent low scores, especially across diverse test sets, may herald intrinsic flaws in the model's prowess. **Strengths**: ROUGE's primary asset is its multifaceted view on text quality, enabled by an array of evaluation metrics. It graciously accommodates synonyms and rephrasing due to its n-gram-based approach, and it champions the retention of salient word sequences via the longest common subsequence tactic. The visual representation of precision, recall, and F1-scores facilitates an intuitive grasp of model efficacy. **Limitations**: In spite of its advantages, certain constraints tether ROUGE. It might not adequately address the semantic coherence, fluency, or grammatical integrity of the generated narrative, leaning more towards evaluating isolated phrases or n-grams. The metric can be less discerning when critiquing elaborate sentences due to its fragmentary nature. Moreover, as it banks on comparisons with human-made references, procuring such benchmarks can be challenging or even impractical at times.\nvalidmind.model_validation.RougeMetrics\n\n\nMetric\nModel Metadata\n**Purpose:** This test is designed to collect and summarize important metadata related to a particular machine learning model. Such metadata includes the model's architecture (modeling technique), the version and type of modeling framework used, and the programming language the model is written in. **Test Mechanism:** The mechanism of this test consists of extracting information from the model instance. It tries to extract the model information such as the modeling technique used, the modeling framework version, and the programming language. It decorates this information into a data frame and returns a summary of the results. **Signs of High Risk:** High risk could be determined by a lack of documentation or inscrutable metadata for the model. For instance, unidentifiable language, outdated or unsupported versions of modeling frameworks, or undisclosed model architectures reflect risky situations, as they could hinder future reproducibility, support, and debugging of the model. **Strengths:** The strengths of this test lie in the increased transparency and understanding it brings regarding the model's setup. Knowing the model's architecture, the specific modeling framework version used, and the language involved, provides multiple benefits: supports better error understanding and debugging, facilitates model reuse, aids compliance of software policies, and assists in planning for model obsolescence due to evolving or discontinuing software and dependencies. **Limitations:** Notably, this test is largely dependent on the compliance and correctness of information provided by the model or the model developer. If the model's built-in methods for describing its architecture, framework or language are incorrect or lack necessary information, this test will hold limitations. Moreover, it is not designed to directly evaluate the performance or accuracy of the model, rather it provides supplementary information which aids in comprehensive analysis.\nvalidmind.model_validation.ModelMetadata\n\n\nMetric\nToken Disparity\n**Purpose**: The purpose of the Token Disparity metric is to evaluate the distributional match between the predicted and actual outputs (tokens) of the model. This is done by creating a comparison through histograms that outline the disparity in the number of tokens in both columns. The metric is also used to assess the verbosity of the model's predictions in comparison to the actual data. **Test Mechanism**: The test is implemented by tokenizing the two columns: one for the real data and the other for the generated or predicted data. It uses the BERT tokenizer to tokenize the content of each column. Then, it counts the tokens in each column. These counts are then arranged into two different histograms to visualize the distribution of token counts in the real data and the generated data. The metric quantifies the distribution disparity by comparing the histogram of the true tokens with the histogram of predicted tokens. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or failures might be indicated by significant differences in distribution typologies between the two histograms, especially if the predicted histogram considerably diverges from the reference histogram. It may signify that the model is generating outputs with unexpected verbosity, resulting in either far too many or too few tokens than expected. **Strengths**: The primary strength of this metric is that it provides a clear and visual comparison of predicted versus actual token distributions in the model. It helps in understanding the consistency and quality of the model's output in terms of length and verbosity. It also allows detection of potential issues in the model's output generation capabilities, such as over-generation or under-generation of tokens compared to the actual data. **Limitations**: This metric focuses strictly on the count of tokens without considering the semantics behind the tokens. Therefore, it may overlook issues related to the meaningfulness or relevance of the produced tokens. Furthermore, it assumes that a similar distribution of token counts between predicted and actual data implies accurate output, which may not always hold true. Also, it depends on the BERT tokenizer which may not be the best tokenizer for all kinds of text data.\nvalidmind.model_validation.TokenDisparity\n\n\nMetric\nClassifier Out Of Sample Performance\n**Purpose**: This test is designed to assess the performance of a Machine Learning model on out-of-sample data - i.e., data not used during the training phase. This test uses a variety of metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) to evaluate how well the trained model generalizes to unseen data. It helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting the training data and is capable of making accurate predictions on new, unseen data. **Test Mechanism**: The test invokes the metrics on the model's predicted outcomes for the testing data set and compares those predictions to the actual outcomes. If the testing data set is properly set aside during the model training and is not used in any way in the model learning process, it should provide a fair and unbiased measure of how well the model can generalize. The metrics used typically include accuracy (proportion of correct predictions), precision (proportion of positive predictions that were correct), recall (proportion of actual positives that were predicted correctly), and F1 score (a single statistic that balances precision and recall). **Signs of High Risk**: Indications of high risk might include a low accuracy rate, low precision and recall rates, a low F1 score, or significant discrepancies between the model's performance on training data and on testing data. The latter may point to overfitting, meaning the model may not generalize well to new data. **Strengths**: The major strength of this test is its ability to measure a model's predictive performance on unseen data, thereby giving a fair estimate of its generalizability. This test takes into account various performance metrics to provide a comprehensive performance evaluation. It also helps detect overfitting, an important aspect to consider for any machine learning model. **Limitations**: This test's limitations are centered around the dependability of the test dataset. If the test dataset is not a good representative of the real-world data the model will be applied to, the performance metrics may not accurately reflect the true performance of the model. It's also worth noting that all the metrics used (accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score) assume that all errors or misclassifications are equally important, which is not always the case in real-world scenarios.\nvalidmind.model_validation.sklearn.ClassifierOutOfSamplePerformance\n\n\nThresholdTest\nRobustness Diagnosis\n**Purpose**: The purpose of this test is to evaluate the robustness of a machine learning model. Robustness refers to a model's ability to maintain a high level of performance in the face of perturbations or changes—particularly noise—added to its input data. Such simulated scenarios help to assess if the model can handle situations where the input data might be incomplete or corrupted. **Test Mechanism**: This test method works by adding Gaussian noise, proportional to a certain standard deviation scale, to input features (only numerical) of both the training and testing datasets. The performance of the model with perturbed features is then computed based on a metric (default is 'accuracy'). This process is iterated over a list of defined scale factors. The results are then visualized using a line chart, depicting the accuracy trend against the amount of noise introduced. A threshold is set to determine the decay in accuracy due to perturbation that is deemed acceptable. **Signs of High Risk**: Signs of high risk include significant drops in accuracy when noise is introduced to feature inputs. If the decay in accuracy breaches the configured threshold, it is a strong indicator of a high-risk condition. High risk may also pertain to a situation where one or more elements provided in the features list do not match with the training dataset's numerical feature columns. **Strengths**: The robustness diagnosis test offers the following advantages: - It provides an empirical measure of the model's performance in handling noise or data perturbations, offering insights into the model's reliability and stability. - The test is flexible and customizable with the ability to select specific features to perturb and to control the noise level applied. - Detailed results visualization aids in the interpretability of robustness testing. **Limitations**: Despite the benefits, the test also exhibits some limitations: - It only perturbs the numerical features while leaving out features of non-numerical types, potentially providing an incomplete robustness analysis. - Default metric used is accuracy which might not always provide the best measure of a model's success, especially for imbalanced datasets. - The test is reliant on the assumption that the injected Gaussian noise is an adequate representation of potential corruption or incompleteness in real-world data. - The set decay threshold for accuracy might need to be fine-tuned or adjusted based on domain knowledge or specific project requirements. - The test might not perform as expected for datasets with a text column.\nvalidmind.model_validation.sklearn.RobustnessDiagnosis\n\n\nMetric\nSHAP Global Importance\n**Purpose:** The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) Global Importance metric illuminates the outcomes of machine learning models by attributing them to the contributing features. It assigns a quantifiable global importance to features via their absolute Shapley values, making it applicable for tasks such as classification (both binary and multiclass). This metric is pivotal in the model risk management strategy. **Test Mechanism:** The first step involves choosing an appropriate explainer that matches the model type: TreeExplainer for tree-based models (like XGBClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, CatBoostClassifier) and LinearExplainer for linear ones (such as LogisticRegression, XGBRegressor, LinearRegression). Once the explainer calculates the Shapley values, they are visualized through two specific plots: 1. **Mean Importance Plot**: This graph denotes the significance of each feature grounded in its absolute Shapley values. By computing the average of these absolute Shapley values across the entire dataset, the global importance of features is elucidated. 2. **Summary Plot**: This visual representation amalgamates the importance of each feature with their effects. Each dot on this plot symbolizes a Shapley value for a distinct feature in a specific instance. The vertical axis represents the feature, while the horizontal axis corresponds to the Shapley value. A color gradient, shifting from low to high, marks the feature's value. Overlapping points experience a slight vertical dispersion, offering a snapshot of the Shapley values' distribution for each attribute. Features are methodically aligned in accordance with their prominence. The function `_generate_shap_plot()` renders these plots with the aforementioned types. **Signs of High Risk:** Overly dominant features in SHAP importance plots hint at potential model overfitting. Anomalies, like unexpected or speculative features flaunting high importance, could suggest that the model's decisions are rooted in incorrect or undesirable reasoning. Moreover, a SHAP summary plot teeming with high variability or scattered data points is a cause for concern. **Strengths:** Beyond delineating global feature significance, SHAP offers a granular perspective on how individual attributes shape the model's decision logic for each instance. This advanced method unravels model behavior with clarity. Its flexibility is evident in its support for a diverse array of model types, ensuring uniform interpretations across different models. **Limitations:** For large datasets or intricate models, SHAP's computations might demand substantial time and resources. Moreover, its compatibility does not extend to every model class, especially models from libraries like \"statsmodels\", \"pytorch\", \"catboost\", \"transformers\", \"FoundationModel\", and \"R\". High-dimensional data can muddle interpretations, and linking importance to tangible real-world impact retains a degree of subjectivity.\nvalidmind.model_validation.sklearn.SHAPGlobalImportance\n\n\nMetric\nConfusion Matrix\n**Purpose**: The Confusion Matrix tester is tasked with evaluating the performance of a classification Machine Learning model. The matrix indicates how well the model can accurately distinguish true and false positives and negatives - basic indicators of model accuracy. **Test Mechanism**: The classification model's results (`y_test_predict`) are compared against the actual results (`y_test_true`). The unique labels identified from `y_test_true` are used to create a confusion matrix using scikit-learn's metrics. The matrix is then rendered using Plotly's `create_annotated_heatmap` function. Outcomes such as True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN) are plotted in a color-coded heatmap, providing a visualized 2D representation of the model's performance. **Signs of High Risk**: High risks associated with the model are signaled by high numbers of False Positives (FP) and False Negatives (FN), which demonstrates the model's inability to accurately classify. On the other hand, low numbers of True Positives (TP) and True Negatives (TN) also indicate problematic situation, meaning the model is unable to correctly identify the class labels. **Strengths**: Utilizing a Confusion Matrix has various strengths: - It allows a clear and simple visual summary of the classification model's prediction accuracy. - It provides explicit metrics for True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN), making it easy to highlight potential improvements. - It's beneficial for multi-class classification problems, since it can provide readability for complex models in a simplified manner. - It assists in understanding the different types of errors your model might make, by providing both Type-I and Type-II errors. **Limitations**: However, the Confusion Matrix also comes with limitations: - In conditions of unbalanced classes, the utility of the confusion matrix can be limited. It might quite erroneously perceive a model to perform well when it's merely predicting the majority class. - It does not deliver a single unified statistic that can appraise model performance. It merely indicates different facets of model performance separately. - It's largely a descriptive technique and does not allow for statistical hypothesis testing. - Misinterpretation risks also exist, as it doesn't directly provide precision, recall or F1-score data. These metrics need to be computed separately.\nvalidmind.model_validation.sklearn.ConfusionMatrix\n\n\nMetric\nClassifier In Sample Performance\n**Purpose**: The purpose of this metric is to evaluate the performance of the machine learning model on the training data. It measures commonly-used metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This test is typically used to gauge the model's ability to generalize its predictions to new, unseen data. It also measures the model's level of overfitting on the training set. **Test Mechanism**: This test uses metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. It applies these metrics to the model's predictions on the training set, and compares them with the true values. The accuracy measures the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. Precision gauges the number of true positive predictions relative to the total number of positive predictions. Recall indicates the number of true positive predictions relative to the total number of actual positives in the dataset. Finally, F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing an overall measure of the model's performance. **Signs of High Risk**: If the model has near perfect performance on all metrics on the training data but performs poorly on unseen data, it could be a sign of overfitting and hence, a high-risk scenario. Also, low values on any of these metrics can indicate an underperforming model, which may pose risk in production-grade applications. **Strengths**: Analyzing the model's performance using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score allows for a well-rounded assessment. The output is easy-to-interpret because they are widely used and understood in the machine learning community. Besides, since this test is applied to the training set, it can help detect instances of overfitting early in the model's development. **Limitations**: While these metrics provide useful insights, they are prone to biases in the training data. The model may perform well on the training set and yet perform poorly on new, unseen data. Therefore, this test should be complemented with additional validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation or out-of-sample testing, to ensure a less biased evaluation of the model's performance.\nvalidmind.model_validation.sklearn.ClassifierInSamplePerformance\n\n\nThresholdTest\nOverfit Diagnosis\n**Purpose**: The OverfitDiagnosis is a specialized component designed to identify regions prone to overfitting through the utilization of histogram slicing techniques. The code purports to measure the discrepancies between the performance of the model on the training dataset and the testing dataset, segmented into distinct regions established based on the feature space. By identifying the overfitted regions or high residuals, the mechanism guides towards the subsequent application of regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization, dropout, or early stopping, or data augmentation to enhance the overall performance of the model and its generalization ability. **Test Mechanism**: The OverfitDiagnosis test is initiated by running the `run` method with pre-determined `default_params` and `default_metrics`, with 'accuracy' as the specified metric. The method executes the test by formulation distinct regions of the feature space based on binning techniques applied on feature columns from both training and testing datasets, further appending the predicted values. Each formed region is analyzed for performance discrepancies against actual values and the predictions of the model for both the datasets. The performance difference, referred to as the 'gap', is calculated and compared against a cut-off percentage indicating overfitting. In case of overfitting, the `run` method returns a **failed** status, while a successful test results in a **passed** status. Meanwhile, the function also prepares figures illustrating the overfitting regions. **Signs of High Risk**: The signs of high-risk associated with this model include: - A high value in the 'gap' between training and testing data accuracy - the larger the gap, the more overfit the model. - A high number and/or large regions of overfitting within the feature space. **Strengths**: - The technique allows for an insightful visual understanding by plotting overfitting regions. - Evaluates potential overfitting on a per-feature basis, allowing for more direct interventions. - Flexible test parameters such as 'cut_off_percentage' and 'features_column' for custom-tailored analysis. - Can handle both categorical and numerical features. **Limitations**: - Currently, this test only applies to classification tasks. Regression tasks are not supported. - Does not perform well with text-based features, limiting the utility in Natural Language Processing models. - Highly dependent on 'bins' setting which determines how the feature space is segmented. Different bin settings may produce different results. - Cut-off percentage for overfitting is arbitrary and no guideline is provided to set it optimally. - Performance metrics are limited to accuracy, limiting precision in the case of imbalanced datasets.\nvalidmind.model_validation.sklearn.OverfitDiagnosis\n\n\nMetric\nPermutation Feature Importance\n**Purpose**: The purpose of the \"Permutation Feature Importance\" (PFI) metric is to quantify the importance of each feature used by the ML model. This is measured depending on how much the model's performance decreases when the values of each feature are permuted. **Test Mechanism**: The PFI metric is calculated using the `permutation_importance` method from the `sklearn.inspection` module. This function randomly permutes the columns of the feature dataset fed into the ML model and measures how the model's performance changes. If the model's performance worsens significantly after permuting a feature's values, that feature is deemed important. If the performance remains relatively constant, the feature is considered unimportant. At the end of the execution, PFI metric returns a figure displaying the feature importance of each feature. **Signs of High Risk**: An indication of risk would be if the model primarily depends on a feature whose values can easily be permuted or have high variance, suggesting instability. Another risk could be if there's a feature predicted as of no importance but is known to have significant influence on the expected outcome based on domain knowledge. **Strengths**: The PFI metric has several key advantages. It can provide an understanding of which features are crucial for the model's predictions, potentially revealing insights about the data's structure. This can also help determine if the model is overfitting on a particular feature or set of features. Moreover, PFI is model-agnostic and can be used for any classifier which can provide a measure of prediction accuracy before and after permuting features. **Limitations**: Although this metric is particularly helpful, there are some limitations too. The primary limitation is that feature importance calculated from this method does not imply causality—it only speaks to the amount of information the feature provides about the prediction task. Besides, permutation importance does not consider the interaction between features. If two features are correlated, the permutation importance might allocate importance to only one at the expense of the other. Finally, it cannot handle models from certain libraries like statsmodels, pytorch, catboost etc., thus limiting its applicability.\nvalidmind.model_validation.sklearn.PermutationFeatureImportance\n\n\nThresholdTest\nMinimum ROCAUC Score\n**Purpose**: This test metric, Minimum ROC AUC Score, is used to determine the model's performance by ensuring that the Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC) score on the validation dataset meets or exceeds a predefined threshold. The ROC AUC score is an indicator of how well the model is capable of distinguishing between different classes, making it a crucial measure in binary and multiclass classification tasks. **Test Mechanism**: This test implementation calculates the multiclass ROC AUC score on the true target values and the model's prediction. The test converts the multi-class target variables into binary format using `LabelBinarizer` before computing the score. If this ROC AUC score is higher than the predefined threshold (defaulted to 0.5), the test passes; otherwise, it fails. The results, including the ROC AUC score, the threshold, and whether the test passed or failed, are then stored in a `ThresholdTestResult` object. **Signs of High Risk**: A high risk or failure in the model's performance as related to this metric would be represented by a low ROC AUC score, specifically any score lower than the predefined minimum threshold. This suggests that the model is struggling to distinguish between different classes effectively. **Strengths**: This metric is advantageous for the following reasons: - The test considers both the true positive rate and false positive rate, providing a comprehensive performance measure. - ROC AUC score is threshold-independent meaning it measures the model's quality across various classification thresholds. - Works robustly with binary as well as multi-class classification problems. **Limitations**: Despite its strengths, the metric presents certain limitations: - ROC AUC may not be useful if the class distribution is highly imbalanced; it could perform well in terms of AUC but still fail to predict the minority class. - The test does not provide insight into what specific aspects of the model are causing poor performance if the ROC AUC score is unsatisfactory. - The use of macro average for multiclass ROC AUC score implies equal weightage to each class, which might not be appropriate if the classes are imbalanced.\nvalidmind.model_validation.sklearn.MinimumROCAUCScore\n\n\nMetric\nPrecision Recall Curve\n**Purpose**: The Precision Recall Curve metric is intended to evaluate the trade-off between precision and recall in classification models, particularly binary classification models. It assesses the model's capacity to produce accurate results (high precision), as well as its ability to capture a majority of all positive instances (high recall). **Test Mechanism**: The test extracts ground truth labels and prediction probabilities from the model's test dataset. It applies the precision_recall_curve method from the sklearn metrics module to these extracted labels and predictions, which computes a precision-recall pair for each possible threshold. This calculation results in an array of precision and recall scores that can be plotted against each other to form the Precision-Recall Curve. This curve is then visually represented by using Plotly's scatter plot. **Signs of High Risk**: A lower area under the Precision-Recall Curve signifies high risk. This corresponds to a model yielding a high amount of false positives (low precision) and/or false negatives (low recall). If the curve is closer to the bottom left of the plot, rather than being closer to the top right corner, it can be a sign of high risk. **Strengths**: This metric aptly represents the balance between precision (minimizing false positives) and recall (minimizing false negatives), which is especially critical in scenarios where both values are significant. Through the graphic representation, it enables an intuitive understanding of the model's performance across different threshold levels. **Limitations**: This metric is only applicable to binary classification models – it raises errors for multiclass classification models or Foundation models. Also, it may not fully represent the overall accuracy of the model if the cost of false positives and false negatives are extremely different, or if the dataset is heavily imbalanced.\nvalidmind.model_validation.sklearn.PrecisionRecallCurve\n\n\nMetric\nClassifier Performance\n**Purpose**: The provided script assesses the performance of Machine Learning classification models. The performance is calculated by determining the precision, recall, F1-Score, accuracy, and the ROC AUC (Receiver operating characteristic - Area under the curve) scores. The test accepts both binary and multiclass models. **Test Mechanism**: The script generates a report that includes precision, recall, F1-Score, and accuracy using the `classification_report` method from the scikit-learn's metrics module. For multiclass models, weighted and macro averages for these scores are also computed. Additionally, the script calculates and includes the ROC AUC scores for the model using a custom method, `multiclass_roc_auc_score`. The output of the test is a structured report that differs depending on whether the model is binary or multiclass. **Signs of High Risk**: Indicators of high risk or a failing model include low values for the metrics used - precision, recall, F1-Score, accuracy, and ROC AUC. An imbalanced precision and recall score can also indicate a high-risk model, as precision focuses on the correct prediction of the positive class, while recall focuses on the number of correctly identified actual positive cases. A low ROC AUC score, particularly when it is close to 0.5 or below, is a strong indicator of a failing model. **Strengths**: This metric excels in its versatility by being capable of handling both binary and multiclass models. It computes several commonly used performance metrics, providing a comprehensive view of the model's performance. Using ROC-AUC as a metric can help in identifying the best threshold for classification, especially when datasets are unbalanced. **Limitations**: The test relies on labels being correctly identified for binary classification models, raising an exception if the positive class is not labeled as \"1\", which might not always be the case in practical applications. Furthermore, this script is designed only for classification models and cannot evaluate regression models. The calculated metrics might not be informative in situations where the test dataset is not representative of the data the model will encounter.\nvalidmind.model_validation.sklearn.ClassifierPerformance\n\n\nThresholdTest\nMinimum F1 Score\n**Purpose**: The primary purpose of this test is to ensure that the model's F1 score - a balanced reflection of both precision and recall - meets or surpasses a predetermined threshold on the validation dataset. This F1 score is a valuable measure of model performance in classification tasks, particularly where the proportion of positive and negative classes is imbalanced. **Test Mechanism**: The model's F1 score is calculated for the validation dataset via python's scikit-learn metrics. The scoring differs according to the classification problem: for multi-class, it uses macro averaging (calculating metrics separately then finding their unweighted mean), and for binary classification, it uses inherent f1_score calculation. The computed F1 score is then compared against the predetermined threshold - a minimum F1 score the model is expected to achieve. **Signs of High Risk**: Any model that returns an F1 score lower than the set threshold is considered high risk. A low F1 score could indicate that the model is not striking a desirable balance between precision and recall, or in simpler terms, it is not doing well in correctly identifying positive classes and limiting false positives. **Strengths**: This metric provides the advantage of being a balanced measure of a model's performance by considering both false positives and false negatives. It is particularly useful in scenarios with imbalanced class distribution, where accuracy can be misleading. It also allows for customization of the minimum acceptable performance by setting the threshold value. **Limitations**: This testing method may not be appropriate for all types of models and machine learning tasks. Also, while the F1 score captures a balanced view of a model's performance, it assumes equal cost for false positives and false negatives, which may not always be the case in certain real world scenarios. This limitation may compel practitioners to choose other metrics such as precision, recall, or the ROC-AUC score that align better with their specific needs.\nvalidmind.model_validation.sklearn.MinimumF1Score\n\n\nMetric\nROC Curve\n**Purpose**: The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a critical analysis tool for the performance of binary classification models. The ROC curve displays the trade-off between the True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) at varying threshold levels. The ROC curve, together with the Area Under the Curve (AUC), is designed to provide a measure of how well the model can discriminate between the two classes in a binary classification problem (e.g., default vs non-default). The higher the AUC score, the better the model is at correctly distinguishing between the positive and negative classes. **Test Mechanism**: This script extracts the target model and datasets, where binary classification is a requirement. Next, it computes predicted probabilities for the test set. It then calculates and plots the ROC curve using the true outcomes and predicted probabilities, along with the line representing randomness (AUC of 0.5). The AUC score for the ROC curve of the model is also computed, giving a numeric estimate of the model's performance. Any Infinite values in the ROC threshold are identified and removed in the process. The resulting ROC curve, AUC score, and thresholds are subsequently saved. **Signs of High Risk**: There would be a high risk associated with the performance of the model if the AUC score is below or close to 0.5, or if the ROC curve is observed to be closer to the line of randomness (indicating no discriminative power). It's essential to note that the AUC score must be significantly greater than 0.5 for the model to be considered effective at its classification task. **Strengths**: The ROC Curve provides a comprehensive visual representation of a model’s discriminative power over all possible classification thresholds, unlike metrics that only reveal model performance at a single set threshold. The AUC Score, which summarizes the ROC curve into a single value, remains consistent in the face of imbalanced datasets, making it an ideal choice for such cases. **Limitations**: This test is designed specifically for binary classification tasks, limiting its application to other model types. Additionally, it might not perform well for models that output probabilities severely skewed towards 0 or 1. In an extreme case, the ROC curve can exhibit high performance even in situations where the majority of classifications are incorrect, if the model's score ranking is preserved. This is known as the \"class imbalance problem.\"\nvalidmind.model_validation.sklearn.ROCCurve\n\n\nThresholdTest\nTraining Test Degradation\n**Purpose**: The 'TrainingTestDegradation' class serves as a test to verify that the degradation in performance between the training and test datasets does not exceed a predefined threshold. This test serves as a measure to check the model's ability to generalize from its training data to unseen test data. It assesses key classification metric scores such as accuracy, precision, recall and f1 score, to verify the model's robustness and reliability. **Test Mechanism**: The code applies several predefined metrics including accuracy, precision, recall and f1 scores to the model's predictions for both the training and test datasets. It calculates the degradation as the difference between the training score and test score divided by the training score. The test is considered successful if the degradation for each metric is less than the preset maximum threshold of 10%. The results are summarized in a table showing each metric's train score, test score, degradation percentage, and pass/fail status. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or failure in the model's performance related to this test can be indicated by one or more of the following: 1. A degradation percentage that exceeds the maximum allowed threshold of 10% for any of the evaluated metrics. 2. A high difference or gap between the metric scores on the training and the test datasets. 3. The 'Pass/Fail' column displaying 'Fail' for any of the evaluated metrics. **Strengths**: 1. This test provides a quantitative measure of the model's ability to generalize to unseen data, which is key for predicting its practical real-world performance. 2. By evaluating multiple metrics, it takes into account different facets of model performance and enables a more holistic evaluation. 3. The use of a variable predefined threshold allows the flexibility to adjust the acceptability criteria for different scenarios. **Limitations**: 1. The test compares raw performance on training and test data, but does not factor in the nature of the data. Areas with less representation in the training set, for instance, might still perform poorly on unseen data. 2. It requires good coverage and balance in the test and training datasets to produce reliable results, which may not always be available. 3. The test is currently only designed for classification tasks.\nvalidmind.model_validation.sklearn.TrainingTestDegradation\n\n\nMetric\nModels Performance Comparison\n**Purpose**: This metric test is intended to evaluate and compare the performance of multiple Machine Learning models on test data. It uses a number of metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score among others, to measure model performance and aid in the selection of the most effective model for the given task. **Test Mechanism**: This test involves using Scikit-learn’s performance metrics to assess model's performance in both binary and multiclass classification tasks. To compare the performances, it evaluates each model on the test dataset and produces a detailed classification report. This includes the aforesaid metrics, along with the roc_auc score. Depending on whether the task at hand is binary or multiclass classification, it calculates metrics globally for the \"positive\" class or their weighted averages, macro averages, and per class metrics respectively. If no models are provided, the test is skipped. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or poor model performance might be indicated by low accuracy, precision, recall, and/or F1 scores, or a low area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (roc_auc). If the metrics' scores are significantly lower than alternative models, it might suggest a high failure risk. **Strengths**: This test allows for straightforward performance comparison of multiple models, accommodating both binary and multiclass classification tasks. It provides a comprehensive report of key performance metrics, offering a holistic view of model performance. It also includes ROC AUC, a robust performance metric that is capable of dealing effectively with class imbalance issues. **Limitations**: This test may not be comprehensive for more complex performance evaluations that consider other factors, such as speed of prediction, computational cost, or specific business constraints. It's also reliant on the provided test dataset, so the chosen models' performance could differ on unseen data or when the data distribution changes. The ROC AUC score isn't necessarily meaningful for multilabel/multiclass tasks, and can be hard to interpret in such contexts.\nvalidmind.model_validation.sklearn.ModelsPerformanceComparison\n\n\nThresholdTest\nWeakspots Diagnosis\n**Purpose:** The weak spots test is designed to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model in specific regions of the feature space. This test consists of dividing the feature space into various sections or slices, evaluating the model's output within each of these sections, and identifying regions where the model's performance metrics fall below specified thresholds. Performance metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. This diagnostic test helps identify areas where the machine learning model may not perform well, potentially exposing its limitations and weaknesses. **Test Mechanism:** The test is performed by slicing the feature space of the training data set into multiple bins. For each bin, the model's performance metrics are computed for both the training and test data sets. If any of the model's performance metrics fall below the predetermined threshold for a particular bin on the test dataset, it is identified as a \"weak spot\". The results are visually represented in a bar chart for each performance metric, marking the bins failing the threshold. **Signs of High Risk:** High risk or failure in the model's performance is indicated when any of the model's performance metrics fall below the set thresholds. If any bin performed significantly worse in the test dataset compared to the training dataset, it might indicate overfitting in that region. Further, if a region or slice has low performance metrics, it suggests that the model does not handle that type of input data well, which may lead to inaccurate predictions. **Strengths:** - The weak spots test helps identify specific regions of the feature space where the model's performance is subpar, which can guide further refinement of the model. - Plotting the performance metrics provides an intuitive way to understand the model's performance across different regions. - The test can be customizable, allowing users to specify various thresholds for multiple performance metrics based on the needs of the specific application. **Limitations:** - By binning the feature space, the test could potentially oversimplify the model's behavior in each region. The granular control of this slicing depends on the bins parameter, and can be coincidentally arbitrary. - The test's effectiveness relies upon the chosen thresholds for the performance metrics, which may not be universally applicable and subject to the model's specification and the application. - The test does not handle datasets with a text column, thus limiting its applicability to only numerical or categorical data. - The test does not directly provide suggestions for model improvement, only highlighting potentially problematic regions.\nvalidmind.model_validation.sklearn.WeakspotsDiagnosis\n\n\nMetric\nPopulation Stability Index\n**Purpose:** The Population Stability Index (PSI) is used to evaluate how stable a predictive model's score distribution is when two different datasets are compared - typically a development and a validation dataset or two separate time periods. This assessment aids in understanding if a significant shift has occurred in the model's performance over time or if there has been a severe change in population characteristics. **Test Mechanism:** In this script, the test mechanism involves comparing the PSI between the training and test datasets. The data from each dataset is sorted and placed into either fixed bins or quantiles. The bin boundaries are established based on the initial population in the case of quantiles. The values in the bins are counted and the proportions calculated. The PSI is then calculated for each bin using a logarithmic transformation of the ratio of the proportions. A summarising table and a grouped bar chart alongside a scatter plot are created showing the PSI, and percentage of original and new data in each bin. **Signs of High Risk:** Signs of high risk would be captured by a high PSI value. A high PSI indicates a dramatic shift in the model's performance or a significant change in population attributes, suggesting that the model may not be performing as expected. **Strengths:** The PSI approach helps assess the stability of a model over time or across samples, which is critical for understanding if the model's performance has changed significantly. It provides a quantitative measure (the PSI value) that allows for direct comparisons across features. The calculation and interpretation of PSI is straightforward making it an effective tool for model validation. The visual display further aids for better understanding. **Limitations:** One potential drawback is that the PSI test doesn't take into account the interdependence between features. It also doesn't provide insights into why the distributions are different. Additionally, PSI may not adequately handle features with significant outliers. Finally, the test is performed here on the model predictions, not on the underlying data distributions - differences in PSI could be due to feature drift, model drift, or both combined, without a clear way to distinguish between them.\nvalidmind.model_validation.sklearn.PopulationStabilityIndex\n\n\nThresholdTest\nMinimum Accuracy\n**Purpose**: The purpose of the Minimum Accuracy test is to validate that the model's prediction accuracy on a given dataset meets or exceeds a predefined minimum threshold. Accuracy is the fraction of predictions our model got right and is an essential metric to understand how well our model is performing. In the context of both binary and multiclass classifications, accurate labeling is crucial. **Test Mechanism**: The mechanism of this threshold test involves comparing the model's accuracy score against the minimum threshold value specified (default value is 0.7). The accuracy score is calculated by using the sklearn's `accuracy_score` method between true label `y_true` and predicted label `class_pred`. If the accuracy score exceeds the threshold, the test is marked as passed. The test result is returned along with the accuracy score and the threshold used for the test. **Signs of High Risk**: Signs of high risk within this test present themselves when the model is unable to meet or exceed the specified score threshold. If the model's accuracy score is consistently falling below the set threshold, it indicates a high risk of inaccurate predictions, which can reduce the model's effectiveness and dependability. **Strengths**: The strength of the Minimum Accuracy test lies in its simplicity. It provides a straightforward measure of overall model performance across all classes. It's particularly advantageous when the classes are balanced. The test is also versatile and can be used with both binary and multiclass classification tasks. **Limitations**: This test's limitations surface when dealing with imbalanced datasets. If the classes in the dataset are highly skewed, the accuracy score could be misleading, potentially favoring the majority class and providing a false sense of model performance. Another limitation is it does not provide a measure of the model's precision, recall, or ability to manage false positives and false negatives. It primarily focuses on overall correctness, which might not be sufficient for all types of model analytics.\nvalidmind.model_validation.sklearn.MinimumAccuracy\n\n\nMetric\nRegression Models Coeffs\n**Purpose**: The 'RegressionModelsCoeffs' test is designed to evaluate and compare the coefficients of different regression models that were trained on the same dataset. This metric assesses how each model weighted the importance of various features during training, which is useful for analyzing which features influenced the model's outputs the most, and how these influence patterns vary between different models. **Test Mechanism**: This test measures the coefficients of each regression model by calling the 'regression_coefficients()' method on the model. These coefficients are then compiled into a summary dataframe for all models. Each row in the dataframe corresponds to a model, with a column for each feature's coefficient. Note, this test is only applicable to 'statsmodels' and 'R' models, and will raise a 'SkipTestError' for models from other libraries. **Signs of High Risk**: Instances that might suggest high risk associated with this test include: discrepancies in the way different models weigh features, if any coefficient is unexpectedly high or low, or the test could not be applied to certain models because they are not of the 'statsmodels' or 'R' types. **Strengths**: This test is highly valuable for gaining insight into the training process of different models and for comparing how the models considered the importance of various features. By monitoring the feature coefficients, this test provides a more transparent evaluation of the model and surfaces crucial weights and biases in the training process. **Limitations**: The primary limitation of this test is its compatibility: it is only designed for use with 'statsmodels' and 'R' regression models. Beyond this, while the test contrasts the ways various models weigh features, it does not indicate which weighting is most appropriate or accurate, leaving room for interpretation. Lastly, this test does not account for potential overfitting or underfitting of models, and the coefficients it produces might not translate to effective performance on unseen data.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.RegressionModelsCoeffs\n\n\nMetric\nBox Pierce\n**Purpose:** The Box-Pierce test is a diagnostic tool employed to check if any form of autocorrelation (serial correlation) is present in the time series dataset, a set of data points indexed in time order, being tested. Autocorrelation is the similarity between observations as a function of the time lag between them. It evaluates the independence of residuals in regression types of tasks in Machine Learning. This is essentially a measure to establish the quality of a time-series model, ensuring the error terms in the model do not follow any specific pattern and are random. **Test Mechanism:** The Box-Pierce test calculates a test statistic and a corresponding p-value from the data features. The computed statistical test checks the null hypothesis that the data are independently distributed. This test is implemented by looping over each feature column in the time-series dataset and applying the `acorr_ljungbox` function from the statsmodels library, which returns both the Box-Pierce test statistic and its corresponding p-value. These values are cached as results. **Signs of High Risk:** A low p-value (typically less than 0.05) in the box-pierce test reflects evidence against the null hypothesis suggesting that there are autocorrelations in the dataset, pointing to a potentially high-risk situation in terms of model performance. Additionally, large Box-Pierce test statistic values may signal the presence of autocorrelation. **Strengths:** The Box-Pierce test is beneficial as it aids in detecting patterns or trends in data that are meant to be random, essentially ensuring the absence of autocorrelation. It can be implemented efficiently due to low computational complexity. Moreover, it can be widely applied for most types of regression problems. **Limitations:** This test assumes homoscedasticity and normality of residuals, assumptions which may not always hold true. It may have reduced power for detecting complex autocorrelation schemes, such as higher order or negative correlations. Also, it does not provide specific insights into the nature or patterns of the autocorrelation if detected; it is solely a general test for the existence of autocorrelation. Furthermore, if the time series data has a trend or seasonality, the Box-Pierce test could give misleading results. Lastly, it's worth stressing it's only applicable to time-series data, limiting its overall utility.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.BoxPierce\n\n\nMetric\nRegression Coeffs Plot\n**Purpose**: The Regression Coefficients with Confidence Intervals plot and metric is used to gain an understanding of the impacts of predictor variables on the response variable under examination. It enables the visualization and analysis of the regression model by displaying the set of coefficients derived from the model and their associated 95% confidence intervals. This provides insight into the variability and uncertainty associated with the model's estimates. **Test Mechanism**: The test extracts the estimated coefficients and their associated standard errors from the regression model. Then, it calculates and draws confidence intervals using a 95% confidence level (standard convention in statistics), which provides an indication of the range where the true value can be expected to fall in 95% of the samples. For instance, if the same regression were run multiple times with samples taken from the same population. The process then visualizes these as a bar plot, with predictor variables on the x-axis and their corresponding coefficients on the y-axis, and the calculated upper and lower margins of the confidence intervals being illustrated as error bars. **Signs of High Risk**: If the zero value (indicating no effect) is within the calculated confidence interval, it suggests that that particular feature/coefficient may not significantly contribute to prediction in the model. If multiple coefficients demonstrate this behavior, the overall reliability of the model could be questioned. Additionally, very wide confidence intervals could suggest high uncertainty in the associated coefficient estimates. **Strengths**: This metric provides a straightforward and easily understood visualization of the significance and impact of the individual predictor variables in a regression model. The inclusion of confidence intervals allows for an examination of the uncertainty around each coefficient estimate. **Limitations**: This test is reliant on certain assumptions about the data: it assumes normality of the residuals and independence of observations, which might not be the case in all types of datasets. Additionally, it does not take into account multi-collinearity (correlation between predictor variables), which can distort the model and make interpretation of the coefficients difficult. Finally, this test is only applicable to regression tasks and tabular data sets, and is not suitable for other types of machine learning tasks or data structures.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.RegressionCoeffsPlot\n\n\nMetric\nRegression Model Sensitivity Plot\n**Purpose**: The Regression Sensitivity Plot metric is designed to facilitate sensitivity analysis for regression models. It is primarily utilized for examining the outcome change of a system when alterations(shocks) are applied to one variable at a time, keeping all other variables constant. Its core focus is to analyze the effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable in the regression model, and thus aids in identifying critical risk factors in the model that could significantly influence the output. **Test Mechanism**: This test begins by applying shocks of varying magnitudes (as per defined parameters) to each feature of the model, one at a time. A new prediction is then made for each shocked dataset. Since these shocks are applied while keeping all other variables constant, the resulting changes in the model's predictions can be attributed to the shocks. If a transformation parameter is set to \"integrate\", the initial predictions and target values are transformed using an integration function before being plotted. In the end, a plot of observed values versus predicted values is generated for each model, with a distinct line graph illustrating predictions for each shock. **Signs of High Risk**: If the plot shows drastic changes in model predictions with small shocks to an individual variable, it may be an indication of high risk. This could suggest a high sensitivity of the model to changes in that variable, potentially signaling over-reliance on the variable to make predictions. Unusually high or erratic shifts in the response of the model concerning shocks may also suggest potential model instability or overfitting. **Strengths**: This metric holds the value by enabling the identification of those variables that have a major effect on the model outcomes, thus paving the way towards feature importance understanding. It also generates visual plots, making the results understandable, clear, and interpretable even to non-technical stakeholders. It's beneficial for spotting overfitting and detecting unstable models that too responsive to small changes in variables. **Limitations**: This metric assumes that all other variables remain constant when a shock is applied, which may not always reflect real-world conditions where variables might have complex interdependencies. It is also best suited for linear models and may not always appropriately evaluate the sensitivity of non-linear models. Additionally, it does not provide a numerical measure of risk, it only provides a visual indication, which might be subjective.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.RegressionModelSensitivityPlot\n\n\nMetric\nRegression Models Performance\n**Purpose**: This metric is intended to assess and compare the performance of different regression models. It offers an insightful look into the models' ability to predict dependent variables, both on the data used for training (in-sample) and new data (out-of-sample). Metrics such as R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) are employed. **Test Mechanism**: This test iterates over various regression models supplied as an input list. For each model, it evaluates their in-sample and out-of-sample performance by capturing predictions for the training and test datasets respectively, and comparing these predictions against actual values to calculate R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, and Mean Squared Error (MSE). The models are individually evaluated in this manner, with their results being stored and returned for comparison purposes. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or potential failures in the model's performance might be indicated by excessively large MSE values, or unreasonably low R-squared and Adjusted R-squared values. If the model's performance drastically declines when moving from in-sample to out-of-sample evaluations, this could also signify a high risk of overfitting. **Strengths**: This metric is versatile and allows for the comparison of multiple models at once, providing an objective means of identifying the best-performing model. It provides both in-sample and out-of-sample evaluations, thus informing about the model's performance on unseen data. The use of R-squared and Adjusted R-squared values in addition to MSE provides a comprehensive view of the model's explainability and error rate. **Limitations**: This test presupposes that the regression model's residuals are normally distributed, *i.e.*, a key assumption of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. Thus, it may not appropriately assess models where this assumption is violated. Additionally, it does not account for situations where predictive performance might not directly correlate with higher R-squared or lower MSE values, especially in the event of excessively complex models.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.RegressionModelsPerformance\n\n\nMetric\nZivot Andrews Arch\n**Purpose**: The Zivot-Andrews Arch metric is used to evaluate the order of integration for a time series data in a machine learning model. It's designed to test for stationarity, a crucial aspect in time series analysis where data points are assumed not to be dependent on time. Stationarity is an indication that the statistical properties such as mean, variance and autocorrelation are all constant over time. **Test Mechanism**: For each feature in the dataset, the Zivot-Andrews unit root test is performed using ZivotAndrews function imported from the arch.unitroot module. It returns the zivot-andrews metric for each feature which consists of the statistical value, p-value (probability value), the number of used lags and the number of observations. The p-value is then later utilized to make a decision on the null hypothesis (unit root exists, series is non-stationary) based on a chosen significance level. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk can be suggested by a high p-value. This could imply that there's an insufficient basis to reject the null hypothesis, which states that the time series has a unit root and is therefore non-stationary. Non-stationary time series data may lead to misleading statistics and unreliable Machine Learning models. **Strengths**: The Zivot-Andrews Arch metric can dynamically test for stationarity against structural breaks in time series data, which provides a robust evaluation of stationarity of features. It becomes very useful in the cases of financial, economic or any time-series data where data observations don't have a consistent pattern, and structural breaks might occur. **Limitations**: The Zivot-Andrews Arch metric test assumes that data under consideration comes from a single-equation, autoregressive model. Thus, it may not be suitable for multivariate time series data or data that doesn't follow the autoregressive model assumption. Additionally, it might not account for sudden shocks or changes in the trend of the time series data which can significantly impact the stationarity of the data.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.ZivotAndrewsArch\n\n\nMetric\nRegression Model Outsample Comparison\n**Purpose**: The RegressionModelOutsampleComparison test is designed to evaluate the predictive performance of multiple regression models by means of an out-of-sample test. Crucially, the aim of this test is to validate the model's ability to generalize to unseen data, a need that arises from the challenge of overfitting. Two key metrics, Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), are computed for this purpose to provide a quantifiable measure of the model's accuracy on the testing dataset. **Test Mechanism**: To perform this test, multiple models (in the form of Ordinary Least Squares, or OLS regression models) and a test dataset are required as inputs. For each model, predictions are made on the test dataset, following which, the residuals are calculated. These residuals are then used to compute the MSE and RMSE for each model. The outcomes of the test, including the model's descriptive name, its MSE, and RMSE, are stored and outputted in a structured dataframe format. **Signs of High Risk**: High values of MSE or RMSE indicate elevated risk, signifying that the model's predictions significantly deviate from the actual values in the test dataset. Furthermore, persistently significant discrepancies between training and testing performance across various models might suggest an issue with the input data or with the model selection strategies. **Strengths**: This test effectively provides a comparative evaluation of multiple models' out-of-sample performance, enabling the identification of the best performing model. Moreover, by leveraging both MSE and RMSE, one can gain insights about the model's prediction error. While MSE is sensitive to outliers, emphasising larger errors, RMSE (being in the same unit as the dependent variable) provides a more interpretable measurement of average prediction error. **Limitations**: While this test provides valuable insights about model generalization, its applicability is constrained to regression tasks, and specifically OLS models. Furthermore, it assumes that the test dataset is a representative sample of the population that the built model is intended to be generalized to, which might not always be the case. Lastly, the RMSE and MSE might be less meaningful when the dependent variable scale varies significantly, or the residuals' distribution is heavily skewed or contains outliers.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.RegressionModelOutsampleComparison\n\n\nMetric\nRegression Model Forecast Plot Levels\n**Purpose:** The purpose of `RegressionModelForecastPlotLevels` is to visually evaluate the performance of a given list of regression models. It does this by plotting the forecasts of these models against the observed data in their training and test datasets. It evaluates the model's ability to produce accurate and reliable forecasts when faced with certain input features. The measure of accuracy here is the proximity of the forecasted values to the actual observed values. In case of any transformations specified, the metric also handles transforming the data before the comparison. **Test Mechanism:** The Python class in consideration accepts `transformation` as a parameter, which defaults to None. First, it checks for the presence of model objects and raises a `ValueError` if none are provided. Next, it loops through each model, generating predictive forecasts for the model's training and testing datasets. These forecasts are then plotted against the actual (observed) values. If a transformation, such as \"integrate\", is specified, the class carries out the transformation operation (i.e., it performs cumulative sums to create a new series). Finally, plots are created comparing observed and forecasted values for both the original and transformed datasets. **Signs of High Risk:** High risk or failure in the model's performance can be inferred from the generated plots. If the forecasted values deviate significantly from the observed values in either the training or test datasets, it suggests high risk. A significant deviation could be a sign of overfitting or underfitting, which would be a cause for concern. Such discrepancies could limit the model's ability to produce accurate and generalizable results. **Strengths:** - Visual evaluation: The metric provides a graphical way of evaluating the regression models, allowing easier interpretation and assessment of the forecasting accuracy. - Handles multiple models: The metric enables evaluation of multiple models at once, providing a comparative overview of all models. - Handles transformations: Ability to handle transformations such as \"integrate\" allows for broader scope and flexibility in model evaluations. - Detailed insight: The metric provides a detailed perspective by looking at the performance on both training and testing datasets. **Limitations:** - Visual subjectivity: The metric relies heavily on visual evaluations, and interpretation can vary from person to person. - Limitation in transformations: Currently supports \"integrate\" transformation only. More complex transformation might not be covered. - Overhead: Plotting for large datasets might be computationally expensive and could increase runtime. - Lack of numerical metrics: While visualization is useful, a corresponding numerical measure to support observations would be beneficial.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.RegressionModelForecastPlotLevels\n\n\nMetric\nLog Regression Confusion Matrix\n**Purpose**: The Logistic Regression Confusion Matrix metric is designed to evaluate the performance of a logistic regression classification model by accounting for true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. By using this confusion matrix, one can visually determine how effectively the model is distinguishing between correct and incorrect classifications. The metric is particularly useful in scenarios where predictions are generated by thresholding probabilities. **Test Mechanism**: This metric makes use of Python's `sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix` function to generate the confusion matrix. Initially, the model's predicted probabilities are adjusted to binary predictions using a provided cut-off threshold, by default set to 0.5. Afterwards, the confusion matrix is constructed using the actual and predicted classes. The confusion matrix is designed in such a way that predicted class labels form the x-axis and actual class labels form the y-axis. Each cell of the matrix contains the count of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives respectively. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or indications of model failure would be suggested by large numbers of false positives and false negatives. This would suggest that the model is incorrectly classifying a substantial number of instances. Also, if the true positive and true negative counts are significantly lower than expected, it can be seen as a high-risk indication. **Strengths**: The Logistic Regression Confusion Matrix is a simple and intuitive way to understand model performance. It not only provides a clear picture of how many instances are correctly and incorrectly classified, but also gives a breakdown of the types of errors. By adjusting the cut-off threshold parameter, users can explore trade-offs between precision (minimizing false positives) and recall (minimizing false negatives), making it flexible and adaptable for various prediction scenarios. **Limitations**: Despite its simplicity and clarity, the confusion matrix has its limitations. For imbalanced datasets, confusion matrix might give misleading results. For instance, a model might have a high accuracy by predicting majority classes, yet perform poorly on minority classes. It also does not give any insight into the severity of the mistakes and the cost trade-off between different kinds of misclassifications. Lastly, the choice of the cut-off threshold can significantly impact the interpretation, and an improperly chosen threshold may lead to flawed conclusions.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.LogRegressionConfusionMatrix\n\n\nMetric\nPD Rating Class Plot\n**Purpose**: The Probability of Default (PD) Rating Class Plot is used to understand the distribution of default probabilities across different rating classes. This test is critical in inferring credit risk, as it shows the likelihood of default for different rating classes based on the predictions made by the model. The test is designed to visualize how effectively the model is able to differentiate between different risk levels in the credit data set. **Test Mechanism**: This visualization metric classifies predicted probabilities of defaults into user-defined rating classes (defined in \"rating_classes\" in default parameters), performs a calculation of average default rate within each rating class, and then generates bar plots for each rating class. The generated bar plots aim to illustrate the average probability of default within each class, for both the training and testing data sets. The classification of predicted probabilities is performed using the pandas \"cut\" function, which segments and sorts the data values into bins. **Signs of High Risk**: If the bar plots show that lower rating classes have higher average probabilities of default than higher rating classes, or there is little differentiation between the averages across rating classes, this indicates high risk in the model's ability to accurately predict default levels. Also, a model that produces a vast difference between probabilities for the training and testing set may indicate overfitting, which is also a sign of high risk. **Strengths**: The strength of this metric lies in its ability to visually represent the effectiveness of the model in predicting credit default risk across different risk levels, allowing for easy interpretation. By visualizing the model's effectiveness for each rating class separately, it allows the analyst to quickly identify where the model is struggling. The inclusion of both training and testing data sets helps to quickly highlight issues of overfitting. **Limitations**: The main limitation of this metric comes from predetermining the number of rating classes. Incorrect choices could either oversimplify or overcomplicate the picture of default rates. The metric relies heavily on the assumptions that the rating classes effectively separate different risk levels and that the defined boundaries between rating classes accurately represent the true risk distribution. Furthermore, the tests don't account for class imbalance in the data set that could skew the average probabilities. This metric alone cannot be used for determining the overall performance of the model, and should be used in combination with other evaluation metrics.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.PDRatingClassPlot\n\n\nMetric\nScorecard Histogram\n**Purpose**: The **Scorecard Histogram** test provides a visual representation of the distribution of credit scores produced by an ML model for classification tasks involving credit risk. The metric is primarily designed to analyze how the model's scoring decision aligns with actual outcomes of credit loan applications. In addition, it helps identify potential discrepancies between model predictions and real-world risk levels. **Test Mechanism**: This model-specific metric uses the provided training and test datasets to generate a histogram of credit scores for both default (negative class) and non-default (positive class) instances. It works by calculating the credit score for each instance in the dataset using a logistic regression model's scorecard method which takes into account the contributions of different features to the odds of being a default. It uses a default point to odds (PDO) scaling factor and predefined target score and odds settings. The score distribution is calculated and plotted separately for the training and test sets to facilitate insights into how well the model generalizes to unseen data. **Signs of High Risk**: Indications of potential risk or performance issues in relation to this metric include significant discrepancies between the distributions of training and testing data, skewed distributions favoring a particular score or class, or an abnormal distribution of scores that does not align with expected real-world patterns. If positive and negative classes tend to have similar scores or their distributions overlap significantly, it might suggest the model is not effective at differentiating between the classes. **Strengths**: The Scorecard Histogram metric is useful for visually interpreting the credit scoring system of a machine learning model and can provide a greater understanding of model behavior. It allows for direct comparison of actual and predicted scores for both training and testing data, and provides a way to intuitively visualize model's ability to differentiate between positive and negative classes. It also aids in uncovering patterns or anomalies that might not be evident from numerical metrics alone. **Limitations**: Although valuable for visual interpretation, this method doesn't quantify model's performance, and hence might lack precision when it comes to complete model evaluation. It is also susceptible to the quality of the input data—undue bias or noise in the data will impact both the score calculation and resultant histogram. Additionally, the test is specific to credit scoring models, which limits its usefulness across a broader range of machine learning tasks and models. Finally, the efficacy of the metric is somewhat tied to subjective interpretation, as it relies on the analyst's assessment of the plot's characteristics and implications.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.ScorecardHistogram\n\n\nMetric\nFeature Importance And Significance\n**Purpose**: The 'FeatureImportanceAndSignificance' test in the given script aims to calculate the importance and statistical significance of features within the model's context. It achieves this by comparing the p-values from a regression model and the feature importances from a decision tree model. This test aids in feature selection during the model development process by identifying the most significant variables. **Test Mechanism**: During this test, an initial comparison is made between the p-values from a regression model and the importance of features from a decision tree model. Both the p-values and feature importances are then normalized to ensure uniform comparison. The 'p_threshold' parameter is used to determine what p-value is considered statistically significant. If 'significant_only' parameter is true, features with p-values below the threshold will be included in the final output. The output includes interactive plots displaying Normalized p-values and the corresponding Normalized Feature Importance. Errors are thrown if two models aren't provided (one regression and one decision tree). **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or warning signs in the context of this test might include very high or very low p-values that stand out, suggesting a feature might not be meaningful. The risk may also exist if many unimportant variables (with low feature importance) have significant p-values, which might indicate that the model is possibly overfitted. **Strengths**: It is an excellent test for feature selection mechanisms as it combines two perspectives: statistical significance through p-values and feature importance using a machine learning model (decision tree). Additionally, it includes an interactive visualization, facilitating comprehension of the results easily. **Limitations**: This test only accepts two models - a regression model and a decision tree. Therefore, its application may be limited if other model types are used. Furthermore, the test might not account for potential correlative or causative relationships between the input features, which potentially can lead to inaccurate importance and significance readings. Lastly, it heavily relies on the p-value as a cut-off for feature significance, which critics argue can be arbitrary and might not reflect the true significance of the feature.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.FeatureImportanceAndSignificance\n\n\nMetric\nL Jung Box\n**Purpose**: The Ljung-Box test is a type of statistical test utilized to ascertain whether there are autocorrelations within a given dataset that differ significantly from zero. In the context of a machine learning model, this test is primarily used to evaluate data utilized in regression tasks, especially those involving time series and forecasting. **Test Mechanism**: The test operates by iterating over each feature within the training dataset and applying the `acorr_ljungbox` function from the `statsmodels.stats.diagnostic` library. This function calculates the Ljung-Box statistic and p-value for each feature. These results are then stored in a dictionary where the keys are the feature names and the values are dictionaries containing the statistic and p-value respectively. Generally, a lower p-value indicates a higher likelihood of significant autocorrelations within the feature. **Signs of High Risk**: A high risk or failure in the model's performance relating to this test might be indicated by high Ljung-Box statistic values or low p-values. These outcomes suggest the presence of significant autocorrelations in the respective features, which, if not properly considered or handled in the machine learning model, can negatively affect model performance or bias. **Strengths**: The Ljung-Box test is a powerful tool for detecting autocorrelations within datasets, especially in time series data. It provides quantitative measures (statistic and p-value) that allow for precise evaluation of autocorrelation and can be instrumental in avoiding issues related to autoregressive residuals and other challenges in regression models. **Limitations**: Despite its utility, the Ljung-Box test is not without its limitations. For instance, it cannot detect all types of non-linearity or complex interrelationships among variables. Additionally, testing individual features may not fully encapsulate the dynamics of the data if features interact with each other. Lastly, it is designed more for traditional statistical models and may not be fully compatible with certain types of complex machine learning models.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.LJungBox\n\n\nMetric\nLogistic Reg Prediction Histogram\n**Purpose**: The Logistic Regression Prediction Histogram is designed to generate two overlaid histograms for each of the training and test datasets, to evaluate and visualize the Probability of Default (PD) for positive and negative classes. This serves to analyze the performance of a logistic regression model, especially one related to credit risk prediction. **Test Mechanism**: The operation of this test involves the extraction of the target column from the train and test datasets, followed by the calculation of probabilities using the model's predict function. These probabilities are added as a new column to the training and testing dataframes. The histograms are generated by extracting subsets from these dataframes according to the target column and actual classes they represent (0 or 1 for binary classification scenarios), with different opacities set for better visualization. The four histograms (two for training data, two for test data) are overlaid on two subplot frames (one for training, one for testing), and the result is returned as a plotly graph object. **Signs of High Risk**: The possibility of high risk or failure in the model's performance arises if the histograms show significant discrepancies between the training and testing data, or between the positive and negative classes. These discrepancies could indicate overfitting or potential bias in the model. Additionally, if the probabilities are distributed unevenly, it may suggest that the model is not accurately predicting outcomes. **Strengths**: This test offers numerous strengths. First, it provides a visual representation of the PD generated by a machine learning model, which helps analyze and understand the model's behavior. Second, it can assess both the training and testing datasets, adding layers of validation to the model. Third, it highlights the disparity between multiple classes, offering potential insights into class imbalance or data skewness. Lastly, in the context of credit risk prediction, it is especially beneficial for visualizing the spread of risk across different classes. **Limitations**: Despite its strengths, the Logistic Regression Prediction Histogram has a few limitations. First, it is specifically tailored for binary classification scenarios, where the target variable only has two classes - making it inappropriate for multi-class classification tasks. Second, it is applicable mostly for logistic regression models and might not be as effective or accurate for testing other model types. Finally, while it gives a good visual representation of the model's PD predictions, it does not provide a quantifiable measure or score for model performance.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.LogisticRegPredictionHistogram\n\n\nMetric\nJarque Bera\n**Purpose**: The purpose of the Jarque-Bera test as implemented in this metric is to determine if the features in the dataset of a given Machine Learning model follows a normal distribution. This is essential in understanding the distribution and behavior of the model's features, as numerous statistical methods assume normal distribution of the data. **Test Mechanism**: The test mechanism involves computing the Jarque-Bera statistic and the associated p-value, skew and kurtosis for each feature in the dataset. Necessary variables like the Jarque-Bera statistic, p-value, skew and kurtosis are computed using the 'jarque_bera' function from the 'statsmodels' library in python and stored in a dictionary. The jarque_bera function evaluates the skewness and kurtosis of the input dataset to determine if it follows a normal distribution. A significant p-value (usually less than 0.05) suggests that the feature does not possess normal distribution. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk associated with this test would be a significantly high Jarque-Bera statistic and a low p-value (typically &lt; 0.05). These indicate that the data deviates significantly from a normal distribution, thereby implying that a machine learning model may not function as intended as many models expect feature data to be normally distributed. **Strengths**: The strength of this test lies in its ability to provide insights into the shape of the data distribution. It helps determine whether a given set of data follows a normal distribution or not, enabling risk assessment, especially for models that assume normal distribution of data. By measuring skewness and kurtosis, it also provides extra insights on the nature and magnitude of distribution deviation. **Limitations**: The Jarque-Bera test only checks for normality of the data distribution and will not provide insights about other types of distributions. Datasets which are not normally distributed but may follow some other distribution, may lead to incorrect risk assessments. Additionally, this test is very sensitive to large sample sizes, often rejecting the null hypothesis (that data is normally distributed) for even slight deviations in larger datasets.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.JarqueBera\n\n\nMetric\nPhillips Perron Arch\n**Purpose**: The Phillips-Perron (PP) test is being used to establish the order of integration in time series data. It is a method for testing a null hypothesis that a time series is unit-root non-stationary. When applied to machine learning models, it helps in forecasting and understanding the stochastic behavior of data. In sense, it is used to ensure the robustness of the results and make valid predictions out of regression analysis models. **Test Mechanism**: The PP test is applied to each feature present in the dataset. A data frame is acquired from the dataset and for each column in this data frame, the PhillipsPerron method is used to calculate its statistic value, p-value, used lags and number of observations. This method is calculating the PP metric for each feature and caching the results. **Signs of High Risk**: Indicators of high risk related to this metric could include: - High P-value, which might suggest that the series has a unit root and thus is non-stationary. - Test statistic values that exceed the critical values, providing further evidence of non-stationarity. - If the 'usedlag' value is high for a series, there may be autocorrelation issues which can further complicate model performance. **Strengths**: The strengths of the PP test are as follows: - It is robust against heteroskedasticity in the error term. - It examines relatively long time series. - It helps to identify if the time series is stationary or not, which affects the selection of appropriate models for forecasting. **Limitations**: However, the PP test has some limitations: - It can only be utilized in a univariate time series framework. - The PP test does rely on asymptotic theory, therefore, for small sample sizes the power of the test can substantially reduce. - Non-stationary time series might require differencing to convert them into stationary series, which might lead to loss of important data points.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.PhillipsPerronArch\n\n\nMetric\nKolmogorov Smirnov\n**Purpose**: The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test featured in this metric is aimed at evaluating the distribution of a dataset's features. Particularly, it assesses whether each feature's data follows a normal distribution, which is a crucial assumption in many statistical methods and machine learning models. **Test Mechanism**: The KS test implemented here computes the KS statistic and the corresponding p-value for each column in a dataset. These values are determined by comparing the cumulative distribution function of the dataset's feature with a theoretical normal distribution. A feature-wise KS statistic and p-value are then stored in a dictionary. The threshold p-value, below which the null hypothesis (that the data comes from a normal distribution) can be rejected, is not explicitly set in this implementation and can be defined in accordance with the specific application. **Signs of High Risk**: A higher KS statistic for a feature and a low p-value would suggest a significant discrepancy between that feature's distribution and a normal distribution. Features with substantial deviations might cause problems if the model in use assumes a normal distribution of data, hence pose a risk. **Strengths**: The KS test is sensitive to differences in both the location and shape of the empirical cumulative distribution functions of two samples. It's non-parametric and doesn't assume any specific distribution for the data, making it versatile for various datasets. Being a feature-oriented test, it provides granular insights about the data distribution. **Limitations**: The KS test may be overly sensitive to deviations in the tails of the data distribution, potentially flagging them as non-normal even in cases where these deviations are not necessarily a concern for the model. Moreover, the test could become less powerful with multivariate distributions since it's primarily used for univariate distributions. Also, as it's a goodness-of-fit test, it does not point out specific forms of non-normality such as skewness or kurtosis that could be relevant for model fitting.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.KolmogorovSmirnov\n\n\nMetric\nResiduals Visual Inspection\n**Purpose**: The main purpose of this metric is to visualize and analyze the residuals (the differences between the observed and predicted values) of a regression problem. It allows for a graphical exploration of the model's errors, helping to identify statistical patterns or anomalies that may indicate a systematic bias in the model's predictions. By inspecting the residuals, we can check how well the model fits the data and meets the assumptions of the model. **Test Mechanism**: The metric generates four common types of residual plots which are: a histogram with kernel density estimation, a quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot, a residuals series dot plot, and an autocorrelation function (ACF) plot. - The residuals histogram with kernel density estimation visualizes the distribution of residuals and allows to check if they are normally distributed. - Q-Q plot compares the observed quantiles of the data to the quantiles of a standard normal distribution, helping to assess the normality of residuals. - A residuals dot plot indicates the variation in residuals over time, which helps in identifying any time-related pattern in residuals. - ACF plot visualizes the correlation of an observation with its previous observations, helping to pinpoint any seasonality effect within residuals. **Signs of High Risk**: - Skewness or asymmetry in the histogram or a significant deviation from the straight line in the Q-Q plot, which indicates that the residuals aren't normally distributed. - Large spikes in the ACF plot, indicating that the residuals are correlated, in violation of the assumption that they are independent. - Non-random patterns in the dot plot of residuals, indicating potential model misspecification. **Strengths**: - Visual analysis of residuals is a powerful yet simple way to understand a model’s behavior across the data set and to identify problems with the model's assumptions or its fit to the data. - The test is applicable to any regression model, irrespective of complexity. - By exploring residuals, we might uncover relationships that were not captured by the model, revealing opportunities for model improvement. **Limitations**: - Visual tests are largely subjective and can be open to interpretation. Clear-cut decisions about the model based solely on these plots may not be possible. - The metrics from the test do not directly infer the action based on the results; domain-specific knowledge and expert judgement is often required to interpret the results. - These plots can indicate a problem with the model but they do not necessarily reveal the nature or cause of the problem. - The test assumes that the error terms are identically distributed, which might not always be the case in real-world scenarios.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.ResidualsVisualInspection\n\n\nMetric\nShapiro Wilk\n**Purpose**: The Shapiro-Wilk metric is used to assess if a given set of data adheres to the standard normal distribution. This is integral in machine learning modeling as the normality of data can significantly affect model performance. In particular, it is used on different features of the dataset in both classification and regression tasks. **Test Mechanism**: By implementing the Shapiro-Wilk test for each feature column in the training dataset, we determine if the data in these columns conform to the normal distribution. The test returns a statistic and a p-value, where the p-value is used to decipher whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis (the data being tested is normally distributed). **Signs of High Risk**: A lower p-value, typically below 0.05, indicates a high risk as it rejects the null hypothesis, meaning that the data is not normally distributed. For ML models that assume normality of data, this could lead to poor performance or inaccurate predictions. **Strengths**: The Shapiro-Wilk test is known for its precision, making it especially useful on small to moderate-sized datasets. It also works on both classification and regression tasks, providing more versatility in its usage. Since it tests each feature column separately, it can give an alert if any particular feature does not conform to normality. **Limitations**: Since Shapiro-Wilk test is quite sensitive, it often rejects the null hypothesis (i.e., data is normally distributed) even for slight deviations, particularly for large datasets. This means the test can consider data as non-normal even if it's approximately normally distributed, potentially leading to 'false alarms' of high risk. Additionally, handling of missing data or outliers needs to be carefully managed before testing as these can highly influence the results. Lastly, it is not ideally suited for data with strong skewness or kurtosis.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.ShapiroWilk\n\n\nMetric\nScorecard Bucket Histogram\n**Purpose**: The 'Scorecard Bucket Histogram' is employed as a metric to evaluate the performance of a classification model, specifically in credit risk assessment. It categorizes model scores into different rating classes, and visualizes the distribution of scores or probabilities within each class. It essentially measures how different risk categories (classes) are distributed in the model scores and provides an insight into the model's classification ability, making it particularly useful in credit scoring and risk modelling where understanding probability of default is critical. **Test Mechanism**: The test works by computing the probabilities for each record in the test and train dataset using the model's predict function. Subsequently, it calculates the scores using a predefined formula incorporating target score, target odds, and points to double odds (PDO). The scores are then bucketed into pre-defined rating classes (such as 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D') and plotted in a histogram for both the train and test datasets. The target score, target odds, points to double the odds (PDO), and rating classes are all customizable parameters, thus allowing for flexibility in test metrics based on differing model or industry norms. **Signs of High Risk**: Indicators of high risk or failure in relation to this metric might include disproportionate scores within rating classes, excessive overlap between classes, or an inconsistent distribution of scores between the training and testing datasets. If the model is accurately classifying and risk is being evenly distributed, we'd anticipate smooth and relatively balanced histograms within classes. **Strengths**: The strengths of this metric lie in its form of output, it provides a quick visual snap of score distribution; it breaks down complex predictions into simple, understandable classes making it easily interpretable for both technical and business audiences. Also, this metric caters to customization of parameters, but most importantly it gives ownership of the class definitions to the user. It is quite useful in the field of credit risk, giving a clear understanding of which class or 'Bucket' a potential borrower belongs to. **Limitations**: One limitation of this metric is its reliance on manual setting of classes and other parameters (like target score, target odds, and PDO), which may lead to arbitrary classifications if not judiciously performed and could potentially introduce biases. Additionally, its effectiveness can be limited if used on non-tabular data. Furthermore, it does not provide a numerical value which can be easily compared across different models or runs, since the output is primarily visual. Consequently, it may not present the complete view of model performance, and should be used in conjunction with other metrics.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.ScorecardBucketHistogram\n\n\nMetric\nRegression Model Insample Comparison\n**Purpose**: The purpose of this test metric, RegressionModelInsampleComparison, is to assess the performance of regression models on the same dataset that they were trained on. The performance of the models is compared against each other to identify which fits the data best. Evaluation metrics include goodness-of-fit statistics such as R-Squared, Adjusted R-Squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). **Test Mechanism**: The test's implementation involves the following steps; - First, a check is done to ensure that the list of models is not empty. - After confirmation, the In-Sample performance of the models is computed by using a private function `_in_sample_performance_ols`. This function: - Loops through each model in the list - For each model, it extracts the features (`X`) and target (`y_true`) from the training dataset and then predicts target values (`y_pred`) - The model's performance metrics are then computed using formulas for R-Squared, Adjusted R-Squared, MSE and RMSE. - The computed metrics, variables of the model and the model's identifier are saved in a dictionary and appended to a list. - The collected results are then saved and returned in form of a pandas dataframe. **Signs of High Risk**: A high risk or failure of the model's performance can be indicated by waiting significantly low values for R-Squared or Adjusted R-Squared and significantly high values for MSE and RMSE. The exact thresholds may vary based on the specific context or domain in which the model is being applied. **Strengths**: - Enables direct comparison of different models' in-sample performance on the same data set, providing a clear picture of which model is better suited to the data. - It computes multiple evaluation methods (R-Squared, Adjusted R-Squared, MSE, RMSE), which provides a comprehensive overview of the model's performance. **Limitations**: - This test only uses in-sample performance, i.e., how well a model fits the data it was trained on. It might not indicate how the model performs on unseen or out-of-sample data, which is a core aspect of modeling tasks. - It might be sensitive to overfitting as better in-sample performance might be a result of the model merely memorizing the training data. - It does not take into account other crucial factors like data's pattern of changes over time, also known as temporal dynamics. - The test doesn't offer a mechanism to automatically determine whether reported metrics are acceptable - human/judgement-based interpretation is needed.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.RegressionModelInsampleComparison\n\n\nMetric\nRegression Feature Significance\n**Purpose**: The Regression Feature Significance metric assesses the significance of each feature in a given set of regression models. It creates a visualization displaying p-values for every feature of each model, assisting model developers in understanding which features are most influential in their models. **Test Mechanism**: The test mechanism involves going through each fitted regression model in a given list, extracting the model coefficients and p-values for each feature, and then plotting these values. The x-axis on the plot contains the p-values while the y-axis denotes the coefficients of each feature. A vertical red line is drawn at the threshold for p-value significance, which is 0.05 by default. Any features with p-values to the left of this line are considered statistically significant at the chosen level. **Signs of High Risk**: Any feature with a high p-value (greater than the threshold) is considered a potential high risk, as it suggests the feature is not statistically significant and may not be reliably contributing to the model's predictions. A high number of such features may indicate problems with the model validation, variable selection, and overall reliability of the model predictions. **Strengths**: 1. Helps identify the features that significantly contribute to a model's prediction, providing insights into the feature importance. 2. Provides tangible, easy-to-understand visualizations to interpret the feature significance. 3. Facilitates comparison of feature importance across multiple models. **Limitations**: 1. This metric assumes model features are independent, which may not always be the case. Multicollinearity (high correlation amongst predictors) can cause high variance and unreliable statistical tests of significance. 2. The p-value strategy for feature selection doesn't take into account the magnitude of the effect, focusing solely on whether the feature is likely non-zero. 3. This test is specific to regression models and wouldn't be suitable for other types of ML models. 4. P-value thresholds are somewhat arbitrary and do not always indicate practical significance, only statistical significance.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.RegressionFeatureSignificance\n\n\nMetric\nRegression Model Summary\n**Purpose**: This metric test evaluates the performance of regression models, specifically capturing their ability to predict the dependent variable(s) given changes in the independent variable(s). It measures the quality of the model using classic regression metrics such as R-Squared, Adjusted R-Squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). **Test Mechanism**: This test utilizes the 'train_ds' attribute of the model to collect and assess the training data. It first retrieves the independent variables and uses the model to predict on the given features. The test calculates several standard regression performance metrics including R-Square, Adjusted R-Squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics quantify how close the predicted responses are to the true responses. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or potentially problematic model performance could be indicated by low R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squared values, or high MSE and RMSE values. Low R-squared and adjusted R-squared values suggest a poor fit between the model predictions and the true responses, indicating the model explains a small portion of the variance in the target variable. High MSE or RMSE represents a high prediction error, which points to poor model performance. **Strengths**: This test offers an extensive evaluation of regression models as it combines four key measures of model accuracy and fit, offering a comprehensive view of the model's performance. Furthermore, both the R-Squared and the Adjusted R-Squared measures are readily interpretable, representing the proportion of total variation in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables. **Limitations**: This test only applies to regression models and cannot be used to evaluate binary classification models or time series models, limiting its scope. Furthermore, while RMSE and MSE are good measures of prediction error, they can be sensitive to outliers, which might lead to an overestimation of the model's prediction error. Lastly, high R-squared or adjusted R-squared doesn't necessarily imply a good model, especially in cases where the model is overfitting the data.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.RegressionModelSummary\n\n\nMetric\nKPSS\n**Purpose**: The Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) unit root test is utilized to check the stationarity of data within the machine learning model. It is used on time-series data specifically, to establish the order of integration, which in turn helps in providing accurate forecasting. The baseline condition for any time series model is that the series should be stationary. **Test Mechanism**: Given a dataset, this metric calculates the KPSS score for each feature in the dataset. Each KPSS score consists of a statistic, a p-value, a used lag, and critical values. The KPSS score calculates the hypothesis that an observable time series is stationary around a deterministic trend. If the calculated statistic is greater than the critical value, the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating that the series is not stationary. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk in relation to this metric would be signified by a high KPSS score, specifically if the calculated statistic is greater than the critical value. This implies that the null hypothesis is rejected and the series is not stationary, making the model ineffective for forecasting. **Strengths**: The KPSS test has several advantages. It assesses directly the stationarity of a series, which is the basic condition of many time-series models and is therefore a crucial step in model validation. Furthermore, the underlying intuition of the test is intuitive and straightforward, making it easily understandable for developers and risk management teams. **Limitations**: Despite its strengths, KPSS does have some limitations. The test assumes the absence of a unit root in the series and does not differentiate between series that are stationary and series that are near-stationary. The test may also have limited power against certain alternatives, and the validity of the test depends on the number of lags chosen.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.KPSS\n\n\nMetric\nLilliefors\n**Purpose**: The Lilliefors test, named after the Swedish statistician Hubert Lilliefors, is used in this context to determine whether the features of the machine learning model's training dataset follow a normal distribution. Normality of distribution is a critical assumption in many statistical procedures and machine learning models. If the features do not follow a normal distribution, certain types of models may not function optimally, potentially leading to inaccurate predictions. **Test Mechanism**: The test is applied to every feature column in the training dataset. For each feature, the Lilliefors test computes a test statistic and a p-value. The test statistic quantifies how far the distribution of the feature is from a perfect normal distribution, while the p-value provides a measure of the statistical significance of this deviation. The results are stored in a dictionary where keys are feature column names, and values are another dictionary containing the test statistic and p-value. **Signs of High Risk**: If the p-value for a feature is less than a predetermined significance level (typically 0.05), this would indicate that the distribution of the feature significantly deviates from a normal distribution. This suggests a high risk as models assuming normality may not work accurately or efficiently with such a feature. **Strengths**: This Lilliefors test is particularly useful because it does not require the mean and variance of the normal distribution to be known in advance, making it a robust choice for real-world data where these values are often unknown. The test is capable of screening every feature column, providing a comprehensive view of the dataset. **Limitations**: While the Lilliefors test is a practical tool to gauge normality, it has a few limitations. It can only test one-dimensional data, so it is not suited for datasets with interactions between features or multi-dimensional phenomena. Additionally, the test may have lower power compared to other tests (like Anderson-Darling test) which means it's slightly less sensitive at detecting departures from normality. Finally, like any statistical test, it can yield false positives or negatives, so relying on it alone without considering other characteristics of the data could be risky.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.Lilliefors\n\n\nMetric\nLogistic Reg Cumulative Prob\n**Purpose**: This metric is used to evaluate the distribution of predicted probabilities for positive and negative classes in a logistic regression model. It's purpose is not only to measure the performance of the model but also to visually assess the behavior of the model by plotting the cumulative probabilities for positive and negative classes across the training and test datasets. **Test Mechanism**: To test the logistic regression model, the metric computes the predicted probabilities for each instance in training and test datasets and adds it as a new column in these sets. The cumulative probabilities for positive and negative classes are then calculated and sorted in ascending order. Subsequently, cumulative distributions of these probabilities are created for both positive and negative classes across both training and test datasets. The cumulative probabilities are presented visually in a plot. The plot has two subplots - one for the training data and the other for the test data, with lines representing cumulative distributions of positive and negative classes. **Signs of High Risk**: Indicators of high risk include: 1. Imbalanced distribution of probabilities for either positive or negative classes. 2. Inconsistencies or significant differences between the cumulative probability distributions for the training data versus the test data. 3. Inconsistencies or significant differences between the cumulative probability distributions for positive and negative classes. **Strengths**: Some major merits of using this metric are: 1. It not only returns numerical probabilities but also provides a visual representation of data which makes it easier to understand and interpret the model's behavior. 2. It allows for comparison of model's behavior across training and testing datasets, which can provide insights into how well the model is generalized. 3. It also distinguishes between positive and negative classes and their respective distribution patterns which can aid in problem diagnosis. **Limitations**: Despite its strengths, this metric also has few limitations: 1. It only applies to classification tasks and specifically to logistic regression models. 2. The graphical results require human interpretation and may not be directly applicable for automated risk detection. 3. The method does not provide a single quantifiable measure of model risk, but rather a visual representation and broad distributional information. 4. If the training and test datasets are not representative of the overall data distribution, the metric could provide misleading results.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.LogisticRegCumulativeProb\n\n\nMetric\nRuns Test\n**Purpose**: The Runs Test is a statistical procedure used to determine whether the sequence of data extracted from the ML model behaves randomly or not. Specifically, it analyzes runs, sequences of consecutive positives or negatives, in the data to check if there are more or fewer runs than expected under the assumption of randomness. This can be an indication of some pattern, trend, or cycle in the model's output which may need attention. **Test Mechanism**: The testing mechanism applies the Runs Test from the statsmodels module on each column of the training dataset. For every feature in the dataset, a Runs Test is executed, whose output includes a Runs Statistic and P-value. A low P-value suggests that data arrangement in the feature is not likely to be random. The results are stored in a dictionary where the keys are the feature names, and the values are another dictionary storing the test statistic and the P-value for each feature. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk is indicated when the P-value is close to zero. If the p-value is less than a predefined significance level (like 0.05), it suggests that the runs (series of positive or negative values) in the model's output are not random and are longer or shorter than what is expected under a random scenario. This would mean there's a high risk of non-random distribution of errors or model outcomes, suggesting potential issues with the model. **Strengths**: The strength of the Runs Test is that it's straightforward and fast for detecting non-random patterns in data sequence. It can validate assumptions of randomness, which is particularly valuable for checking error distributions in regression models, trendless time series data, and making sure a classifier doesn't favour one class over another. Moreover, it can be applied to both classification and regression tasks, making it versatile. **Limitations**: The test assumes that the data is independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.), which might not be the case for many real-world datasets. The conclusion drawn from the low p-value indicating non-randomness does not provide information about the type or the source of the detected pattern. Also, it is sensitive to extreme values (outliers), and overly large or small run sequences can influence the results. Furthermore, this test does not provide model performance evaluation; it is used to detect patterns in the sequence of outputs only.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.RunsTest\n\n\nMetric\nScorecard Probabilities Histogram\n**Purpose**: This metric, referred to as the Scorecard Probabilities Histogram, is used to visualise and evaluate the risk classification of a model especially designed for the credit risk domain. It does this by examining the distribution of the probability of default across different score buckets. The score buckets are categories in which entities (like loan applicants) are placed based on their predicted default risk. Specifically, this metric is used to ensure the model correctly classifies entities into the appropriate risk categories (score buckets) and also properly represents their default probabilities. **Test Mechanism**: The Scorecard Probabilities Histogram first calculates default probabilities using the 'compute_probabilities' method where the output probability is added as a new column to the input dataset. Next, scores are computed using these probabilities, a target score, target odds and Points to Double the odds (pdo) factor in the 'compute_scores' method. These scores are further processed into buckets using the 'compute_buckets' method. Once data is bucketed, a histogram is plotted for each score bucket. This histogram takes the probabilities of default serious as the x-axis and their frequency as the y-axis using the 'plot_probabilities_histogram' method. The process is run separately for both training and testing data. **Signs of High Risk**: If there is a significant overlap of different score buckets in the histogram, this can indicate that the model is not effectively distinguishing between different risk categories. Additionally, if extremely high or low probabilities are common across all buckets, there may be a skew in the model's predictions. **Strengths**: The Scorecard Probabilities Histogram is an advantageous tool for observing and analysing the predicted default risk distribution across different risk categories. This metric allows us to visually inspect the model's performance and its calibration for different risk categories. Moreover, it also provides a mechanism to visualize how these classifications are distributed on the training and testing datasets separately which is beneficial for understanding model generalization. **Limitations**: The Scorecard Probabilities Histogram does have limitations. For one, it assumes that the risk categories are linear and equally spaced, which may not always be the case. Secondly, the visualization may not provide adequate information if there are too few or too many score buckets. Lastly, while this metric effectively visualizes the distribution of probabilities, it provides no concrete numerical metric or threshold to definitively gauge the model's performance. For a more precise evaluation, it should be used in combination with other metrics and tools such as confusion matrix, AUC-ROC, Precision, Recall etc.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.ScorecardProbabilitiesHistogram\n\n\nMetric\nDFGLS Arch\n**Purpose**: The purpose of the Dickey-Fuller GLS (DFGLS) Arch metric is to establish the order of integration of time series data. In machine learning models that deal with time series and forecasting, this metric checks for the presence of a unit root i.e., it tests whether a time series is non-stationary, which is an integral first step in such analyses. **Test Mechanism**: In this code, the Dickey-Fuller GLS unit root test is employed on each feature of the dataset. In other words, it iterates over every individual column of the dataset and applies the DFGLS test to evaluate and report on the presence of a unit root. This information is then stored as output values such as 'stat' for the test statistic, 'pvalue' for the p-value, 'usedlag' for the number of lagged differences used in the regression and 'nobs' for the number of observations. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk in this context would be determined by a high p-value. If the p-value for the DFGLS test is high (e.g., a common threshold is above 0.05), this indicates that the time series data is likely non-stationary, and thus poses a risk for generating unreliable forecasts or analyses. **Strengths**: The Dickey-Fuller GLS is a powerful technique to check the stationarity of times series data. It helps in confirming that the assumptions of the models are met before the actual building of the machine learning models can take place. The results given by this metric provides a clear perspective on whether the data is suitable for certain machine learning models, mainly those that require time-series to be stationary. **Limitations**: Despite its advantages, the DFGLS test also has some limitations. It can lead to incorrect conclusions if the time series has a structural break, or if the time series follows a trend but is otherwise stationary (in which case detrending might be necessary). Also, it doesn't work well with shorter time series data or with volatile data.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.DFGLSArch\n\n\nMetric\nAuto ARIMA\n**Purpose**: This validation test is designed to evaluate and rank ARIMA models, which are popular forecasting models used, amongst other things, for time series prediction tasks. The script automatically fits multiple ARIMA models (with varying orders of differencing, autoregression, and moving average parameters) for each variable in the provided dataset. It then ranks them based on their Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values. This allows efficient selection of the most suitable model for forecasting, based on these standard statistical measures. **Test Mechanism**: The metric works by generating a range of possible combinations of ARIMA model parameters within a predefined limit (max_p, max_d, max_q representing autoregressive, differencing, and moving average components respectively). It fits all these models on the provided time-series data. For each ARIMA model, it calculates and records the BIC and AIC value, which serve as performance measures for the model fit. Furthermore, prior to the parameter fitting, it runs an Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity on the series. If the series isn't stationary, it sends out a warning, as ARIMA models require the input series to be stationary. **Signs of High Risk**: If the p-value of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for any variable is greater than 0.05, a warning is logged indicating that the series might not be stationary, and this can lead to inaccurate results. Secondly, if there is consistent failure in fitting ARIMA models (evident through logged errors), it might indicate issues with the data or model stability. **Strengths**: This mechanism streamlines the potentially complex task of selecting the most suitable ARIMA model based on BIC and AIC criteria. It checks for and warns about non-stationarity in the data, a crucial assumption for ARIMA models. The exhaustive approach in checking all possible combinations of model parameters maximizes the potential for finding the best-fit model. **Limitations**: The approach can be computationally expensive given that it creates and fits multiple ARIMA models per variable. Secondly, a high p-value in the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test indicates a lack of stationarity, but it doesn't make any transformations on the data to rectify this. Additionally, model selection is purely based on BIC and AIC criteria, which might not yield the best predictive model in all scenarios. Also, it's limited to regression tasks on time series data and won't work effectively for other types of Machine Learning tasks.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.AutoARIMA\n\n\nThresholdTest\nADF Test\n**Purpose**: The purpose of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) metric test is to test the null hypothesis that a unit root is present in a time series. In other words, the ADF test aims to check the stationarity of a given time-series dataset. It plays a crucial role in the phases of time series analysis, regression tasks, and forecasting, as these techniques often require the data to be stationary. **Test Mechanism**: The ADF test applies the Python “statsmodels” library's function \"adfuller\" to each column of the training dataset. By doing so, it calculates the ADF statistic, p-value, the number of lags used, and the number of observations in the sample for each column. If the p-value for a column is smaller than the predefined threshold (typically 0.05), then it is considered as having passed the test, thus concluding that the series is stationary. **Signs of High Risk**: If the p-value exceeds the threshold value, the test for that column is considered as failed, which indicates a high risk or potential model performance issue. A high p-value implies that the null hypothesis (indicating a unit root) cannot be rejected, meaning that the series is non-stationary and may cause unreliable and spurious results in the model's performance and forecast. **Strengths**: The ADF test holds several key advantages: 1. Test for stationarity: The ADF test provides a rigorous mechanism for testing the stationarity of time series data, which is critical for many machine learning and statistical models. 2. Comprehensive output: The function provides rich output, including the number of lags used and the number of observations, which can be useful for understanding the behavior of the series. **Limitations**: However, the ADF test also presents some limitations: 1. Dependence on threshold: The result of the test is highly dependent on the threshold chosen. An inappropriate threshold may lead to incorrect rejection or acceptance of the null hypothesis. 2. Inefficient for trending data: The ADF test assumes no deterministic trend in the data. If a deterministic trend exists, the test may identify a stationary series as non-stationary. 3. May lead to false positive: Particularly for larger datasets, the ADF test tends to reject the null hypothesis (indicating a unit root), which can lead to a high propensity for false positives.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.ADFTest\n\n\nMetric\nGINI Table\n**Purpose**: This metric 'GINITable' is used to calculate and display the AUC (Area under the ROC Curve), GINI coefficient, and KS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) statistic for both training and testing datasets. These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of a classification model and quantify its discriminatory power, i.e., its ability to distinguish between different classes. **Test Mechanism**: A dict is created to store performance metrics for both training and testing datasets. The algorithm loops over these datasets and computes the metrics for each. The Area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) Curve (AUC) is calculated by invoking the compute_auc method, which uses the roc_auc_score function from Scikit-Learn. The GINI coefficient, a measure of statistical dispersion, is computed by doubling the AUC and subtracting 1. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic is computed using the roc_curve function of Scikit-Learn, subtracting False Positive Rate (FPR) from True Positive Rate (TPR), and then finding the maximum value from the resulting dataset. The calculated metrics are stored in a pandas DataFrame for neat display. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk is indicated when performance metrics values are low or there is a substantial discrepancy between the performance in training and testing datasets. A low AUC indicates poor classification performance, while a low GINI coefficient suggests low discriminatory power. High KS value, on the other hand, may indicate potential overfitting as it signifies a substantial gap between positive and negative distributions. **Strengths**: 1. This test provides multiple metrics (AUC, GINI, and KS) giving a broader perspective on the model's performance. 2. It compares the performance of the model on both training and testing datasets, offering insight into potential overfitting or underfitting. 3. The metrics used are invariant to class distribution and can effectively measure model performance even for imbalanced datasets. 4. Displays the metrics in a user-friendly, neatly formatted table. **Limitations**: 1. The GINI coefficient and KS statistic are reliant on the AUC value, meaning any error in AUC calculation will propagate and affect these metrics too. 2. It is mainly suitable for binary classification models and may require adjustments for multi-class scenarios. 3. The metrics used are threshold-dependent and may vary significantly based on chosen cut-off points. 4. The test does not contain any method to handle missing or inefficient data which might lead to inaccurate metrics if data is not preprocessed efficiently.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.GINITable\n\n\nMetric\nRegression Model Forecast Plot\n**Purpose**: The \"regression_forecast_plot\" is intended to visually depict the performance of one or more regression models by comparing the model's forecasted outcomes against actual observed values within a specified date range. This metric is especially useful in time-series models or any model where the outcome changes over time, allowing direct comparison of predicted vs actual values. **Test Mechanism**: This test generates a plot for each fitted model in the list. The x-axis represents the date ranging from the specified \"start_date\" to the \"end_date\", while the y-axis shows the value of the outcome variable. Two lines are plotted: one representing the forecasted values and the other representing the observed values. The \"start_date\" and \"end_date\" can be parameters of this test; if these parameters are not provided, they are set to the minimum and maximum date available in the dataset. The test verifies that the provided date range is within the limits of the available data. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or failure signs could be deduced visually from the plots if the forecasted line significantly deviates from the observed line, indicating the model's predicted values are not matching actual outcomes. Furthermore, a model that struggles to handle the edge conditions like maximum and minimum data points could also be considered a sign of risk. **Strengths**: 1. Visualization: The plot provides an intuitive and clear illustration of how well the forecast matches the actual values, making it straightforward even for non-technical stakeholders to interpret. 2. Flexibility: It allows comparison for multiple models and for specified time periods. 3. Model Evaluation: It can be useful in identifying overfitting or underfitting situations, as these will manifest as discrepancies between the forecasted and observed values. **Limitations**: 1. Interpretation Bias: Interpretation of the plot is subjective and can lead to different conclusions by different evaluators. 2. Lack of Precision: Visual representation might not provide precise values of the deviation. 3. Inapplicability: Limited to cases where the order of data points (time-series) matters, it might not be of much use in problems that are not related to time series prediction.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.RegressionModelForecastPlot\n\n\nMetric\nADF\n**Purpose**: The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is primarily utilized in this scenario to ascertain the order of integration of a given time series. In other words, it’s a metric to assess the stationarity of the time series data employed in the machine learning model. The stationary property of time series data is critical in many models as it directly impacts the reliability and robustness of predictions and forecasts. **Test Mechanism**: This test initiates by executing the ADF function from the statsmodels library for every feature in the dataset. Each run results in numerous outputs, including the ADF test statistic, the corresponding p-value, number of lags used, number of observations included in the test, critical values at different confidence levels, and the maximized information criterion. The results are then cached for each attribute for further analysis. **Signs of High Risk**: Observing a large ADF statistic and high p-value (typically above 0.05) would yet suggest a high risk for the model's performance. As both metrics indicate the presence of a unit root, they thus signify non-stationarity in the data series. Such characteristics can often lead to unreliable or inadequate forecasts. **Strengths**: The ADF test has the advantage of being robust to higher-order correlation within the dataset. This intrinsic merit makes it feasible to use in a variety of instances where data may exhibit complex stochastic behavior. Additionally, providing detailed information such as test statistics, critical values, and information criterion enhances the interpretability and transparency of the model validation process. **Limitations**: However, the ADF test does have its share of limitations. It might exhibit low statistical power, making it difficult for to distinguish between a unit root and a level of near-unit-root. This may lead to false negatives, where the test fails to reject a null hypothesis of a unit root when, in reality, it should. Furthermore, the ADF test assumes that the underlying series follows an autoregressive process, which might not always be the case. Lastly, handling time series with structural breaks can be challenging.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.ADF\n\n\nMetric\nDurbin Watson Test\n**Purpose**: The Durbin-Watson Test metric is utilized to detect autocorrelation (i.e., a set of data values are influenced by their predecessors) in time series data. This is especially important in regression tasks, where the independence of residuals is often assumed. If there is a significant autocorrelation, the predictions of the model may not be reliable. **Test Mechanism**: The Durbin-Watson Test metric generates a statistical value for each feature of the training dataset. This is done through the `durbin_watson` function from the `statsmodels` library in Python. The function is looped through all columns of the dataset, calculating and storing the Durbin-Watson (DB) value for each column. The results are then cached and made available for further analysis. A Durbin-Watson metric value close to 2 suggests no autocorrelation, a value toward 0 indicates positive autocorrelation, and a value toward 4 shows negative autocorrelation. **Signs of High Risk**: If the Durbin-Watson value for any of the features is significantly different from 2, it indicates a high risk as it may point to significant autocorrelation issues within the dataset. Particularly, a value closer to '0' might hint at positive autocorrelation, while a value closer to '4' might suggest negative autocorrelation. These autocorrelation issues could lead to unreliable prediction models. **Strengths**: This metric is particularly powerful in identifying autocorrelation in the residuals of prediction models. With this metric, we can diagnose whether residuals have autocorrelation, which could violate the assumptions of various modeling techniques, particularly in regression analysis and time-series data modeling. **Limitations**: The Durbin-Watson Test has several limitations. First, it only detects linear autocorrelation and may miss other types of relationships. Second, it is significantly influenced by the order of data points, and shuffling the order can lead to entirely different results. Lastly, the test only checks for autocorrelation between a variable and its immediate preceding variable, essentially it's of order one, and cannot detect higher order autocorrelation.\nvalidmind.model_validation.statsmodels.DurbinWatsonTest\n\n\nMetric\nMissing Values Risk\n**Purpose**: This metric, Missing Values Risk, is intended to evaluate and quantify the risk associated with missing values in the data set being used for machine learning model training. This metric determines two specific risk measures: 1) what percentage of total data in the dataset are missing values, and 2) what percentage of total variables (i.e., columns) in the dataset have at least some missing values. **Test Mechanism**: The metric tests the dataset by first calculating the total number of datapoints in the data set and the total count of missing values. Then, it examines each column(variable) to find out how many contain at least one missing data point. By meticulously counting missing data points across the whole dataset and then within each variable(column), the metric determines the percentage of missing values in the total dataset and the percentage of columns(variables) with missing values. **Signs of High Risk**: High percentages in either of the risk measures could indicate a high risk. If the dataset has a high percentage of missing values, then it can significantly affect the performance and reliability of the model. Similarly, if a lot of variables (columns) in the dataset have missing values, the model might be prone to bias or overfitting. **Strengths**: This metric provides invaluable insight into the dataset's readiness for model training, as missing values can severely impact both the model's performance and its predictions. Quantifying the risk posed by missing values allows for targeted methods to handle these values properly, either through deletion, imputation, or other strategies. The metric is flexible and can be applied to both classification and regression tasks, thereby maintaining its utility across a broad range of models and scenarios. **Limitations**: This metric only identifies and quantifies the risk of missing values but does not offer any solutions to mitigate this risk. More specifically, it does not infer whether the missingness is random or linked to some underlying issue in data collection or preprocessing. Nonetheless, identifying the presence and extent of missingness is the essential first step in data-quality improvement.\nvalidmind.data_validation.MissingValuesRisk\n\n\nMetric\nIQR Outliers Table\n**Purpose**: The \"Interquartile Range Outliers Table\" (IQROutliersTable) metric is used to detect and summarize outliers in numerical features of a dataset using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. Outliers, values that deviate substantially from general patterns of the data, are crucial to be identified in data pre-processing as they can lead to serious problems in statistical analyses and may degrade the performance of machine learning models. **Test Mechanism**: This metric works by calculating the IQR (the range between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile)) of each numerical feature in a given dataset. An outlier is defined as a data point that falls below \"Q1 - 1.5 * IQR\" or above \"Q3 + 1.5 * IQR\". The number of outliers, as well as their minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum values, are computed and collected for each numerical feature. If no specific features are selected, the metric will be applied to all numerical features in the dataset. Users can customize the outlier threshold. By default, it's 1.5, following the standard definition of outliers in statistical analysis. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk is indicated by a large number of outliers in multiple features, as well as outliers that are far from the mean value of variables, which suggest that they deviate significantly from the general patterns of the data. Additionally, extremely high or low outlier values might also point to data entry errors or other data quality issues. **Strengths**: 1. This metric provides a comprehensive summary of outliers for each numerical feature in the dataset, which can help users identify features with potential quality issues. 2. It's versatile and customizable, allowing users to select specific features and set a custom threshold for defining outliers. 3. The IQR method is robust to the influence of extreme outlier values as it's based on quartile calculations. **Limitations**: 1. This metric might generate false positives if the variable of interest does not follow a normal or near-normal distribution, specifically in case of skewed distributions. 2. It does not provide interpretation or recommendations for handling outliers. The results need to be analyzed by users or data scientists. 3. It only works on numerical features and cannot be used for categorical data. 4. If the data has been heavily pre-processed or manipulated, or if it naturally has a high kurtosis (heavy tails), the set threshold may not work optimally for outlier detection.\nvalidmind.data_validation.IQROutliersTable\n\n\nMetric\nBivariate Features Bar Plots\n**Purpose**: The BivariateFeaturesBarPlots metric is used to conduct a visual analysis of categorical data in the model. The primary aim is to evaluate and comprehend the relationship between different feature pairs while emphasizing the model's target variable. These bivariate plots are extremely useful in revealing trends, correlations, patterns or anomalies that might not be immediately obvious in tabular data. **Test Mechanism**: The test constructs bar plots for each feature pair defined in the parameters. It groups the dataset by each feature pair and calculates the mean of the target variable within each pair grouping. Each group is represented as a bar in the plot with the height of the bar corresponding to the calculated mean. The colors of the bars are determined by the specific category they belong to: either taken from a colormap or generated if the number of categories exceeds the colormap's capacity. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or failure may be indicated if: 1. Any values are missing or inconsistent in the feature pairs. 2. Large differences or variations exist between the mean values of certain categories within the feature pairs. 3. The parameters for feature pairs are not defined or are defined incorrectly. **Strengths**: 1. BivariateFeaturesBarPlots provides a clear, visual understanding of the relationships between feature pairs and the target variable. 2. It allows for easy comparison of different categories within the feature pairs. 3. This metric can deal with a range of categorical data, thus increasing its broad applicability. 4. It's highly customizable, as users can define the feature pairs based on their specific requirements. **Limitations**: 1. It can only be used with categorical data, limiting its utility with numerical or text data. 2. It's dependent on manual input for feature pairs, which may lead to overlooking important feature pairs if not chosen wisely. 3. The generated bar plots can become very cluttered and hard to interpret when dealing with feature pairs with a large number of categories. 4. This metric solely provides a visual analysis and doesn't provide any numerical or statistical measures for quantifying the relationship between feature pairs.\nvalidmind.data_validation.BivariateFeaturesBarPlots\n\n\nThresholdTest\nSkewness\n**Purpose**: The Skewness test is designed to measure the degree to which a given distribution deviates from a normal distribution, indicating any asymmetry in the predictive model's data. The skewness metric can be positive (indicating a distribution with a long tail to the right) or negative (signifying a tail to the left). As consistency and correct data distribution is paramount to good model performance, understanding skewness can assist in identifying data quality issues, making it integral for data profiling in both classic classification and regression machine learning models. **Test Mechanism**: The test is performed by calculating the skewness of numerical columns in the dataset. The skewness is obtained from the DataFrame of the dataset, constrained to numerical data types. An absolute value for the skewness is compared against a maximum threshold (default value of 1). If the calculated value is less than this maximum threshold, the test is marked 'Pass'; otherwise, it's considered 'Fail'. The results are then cached, with the list of result classes for each column indicating the column name, the passed status, and its skewness value compliance. **Signs of High Risk**: Indicators of high risk or potential model performance issues associated with this test include high skewness levels that greatly exceed the max_threshold in a negative or positive direction, representing skewed distribution in data. If data appears consistently skewed, it can show that the underlying assumptions of the Machine Learning model may not apply, and can lead to poor model performance, wrong predictions, or biased inferences. **Strengths**: The skewness test allows for rapid identification of unequal data distributions, which may go unnoticed but may considerably affect the performance of a machine learning model. The test is flexible and can be adapted according to the users' needs, adjusting the maximum threshold parameter. **Limitations**: The test only runs on numeric columns, which means that data in non-numeric columns could still hold bias or problematic skewness not captured by this test. Secondly, it assumes data to follow a normal distribution, which might not always be a realistic expectation in real-world data. Finally, by relying heavily on a manually set threshold, the risk grading might be either too strict or too lenient depending on the chosen threshold, something that might require expertise and iterations to perfect.\nvalidmind.data_validation.Skewness\n\n\nThresholdTest\nDuplicates\n**Purpose**: The Duplicates test aims to evaluate the quality of data in an ML model by identifying duplicate entries in the dataset. It specifically targets duplication in a designated text column or among the primary keys of the dataset, which can have significant implications for model performance and integrity. Duplicate entries can potentially distort data distribution and skew model training. **Test Mechanism**: The test works by counting the total number of duplicate entries within the dataset. If a 'text_column' property is specified, the algorithm will count duplicates within this column. If any primary key is declared, the test will be run on the primary keys as well. The number of duplicates ('n_duplicates') is then compared to a predefined minimum threshold (default 'min_threshold' is set to 1) to determine if the test has passed. Results include total number of duplicates, and the percentage of duplicate rows in the overall dataset ('p_duplicates'). **Signs of High Risk**: The existence of a significant number of duplicates, especially exceeding the minimum threshold, indicates high risk. Potential issues include an overrepresentation of certain data (thus skewing results), or the indication of inefficient data collecting methods leading to data redundancy. Models that predominantly fail this test may need to have their data preprocessing methods or source data reviewed. **Strengths**: The Duplicates test is versatile and can be applied to both text data and tabular data formats. It also provides results calculated both as a count and as a percentage of the total dataset, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the extent of duplication. This metric can effectively flag data quality issues that can skew your model performance and lead to inaccurate predictions. **Limitations**: The Duplicates test only targets exact duplication in entries, which might overlook close 'almost-duplicate' entries, or normalized forms of entries, that may also impact data distribution and model integrity. Data variations due to errors, slight changes in phrasing, or other inconsistencies may not be detected. Furthermore, a high number of duplicates in a dataset may not always indicate poor data quality, depending on the nature of data and the problem being addressed.\nvalidmind.data_validation.Duplicates\n\n\nMetric\nMissing Values Bar Plot\n**Purpose**: The 'MissingValuesBarPlot' metric generates a visual representation that highlights the percentage of missing values in each column of a dataset used in an ML model. This visualization is used to quickly identify and quantify missing data, a critical step in data preprocessing. Missing data can distort the predictions of an ML model and reduce its accuracy. The metric also applies a user-defined threshold to classify columns into those with missing data above (high-risk) and below (less-risk) the threshold. **Test Mechanism**: This metric scans through each column in the input dataset and calculates the percentage of missing values. It preferentially selects columns that have at least some missing data (more than 0%). Each column's missing data percentage is then examined against the predefined threshold. Columns with missing data above the threshold are classified as high-risk. A bar plot is then generated; columns with missing data are displayed on the y-axis, while their corresponding missing data percentages are plotted on the x-axis. Each bar's color is dictated by the missing data's percentage relation to the threshold. Values below the threshold are grey, while ones above are light coral. A red dashed line represents the user-defined threshold on the plot. **Signs of High Risk**: Columns in the dataset represented by light coral bars indicate a high risk. These columns have a higher percentage of missing values than the threshold. If a significant number of columns or crucial features fall into this category, it implies a substantial risk for reliable model performance. **Strengths**: This method offers a snapshot overview of missing data across all the dataset's columns, making it easier to identify problematic areas promptly. It not only helps with quantitative assessment but also with pattern recognition through its visual summary. The user-defined threshold allows a customized level of risk tolerance. It also supports classification and regression tasks, adding to its versatility. **Limitations**: This metric purely looks at the number of missing values and doesn't consider the type of missingness (MCAR, MAR, NMAR) or methods for handling missing entries (like imputation strategies). It also doesn't factor in the potential impact of missing data on the model's accuracy or precision. It might require expert understanding to interpret the findings and take appropriate action.\nvalidmind.data_validation.MissingValuesBarPlot\n\n\nMetric\nDataset Description\n**Purpose**: This test is used to provide a variety of descriptive statistics about the input data used in a machine learning model. Such statistics include measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, and frequency counts for each field (i.e. feature or variable) in the dataset. This helps in understanding the nature of the data, identifying outliers, and understanding how well the data meets the assumptions of the model. **Test Mechanism**: The mechanism starts by transforming the input dataset to its basic form by reversing any one-hot encoding and extracting each field from the dataset. Descriptive statistics are then computed for each field depending on its data type (Numeric, Categorical, Boolean, Dummy, Text, Null). For numeric fields, statistics like mean, standard deviation, min, max and various percentiles are computed. For categorical and boolean fields, frequency counts of each category and the most frequent category (top) are computed. Missing and distinct values are computed for all fields. Additionally, the test generates histograms of the data for numeric and categorical types, as well as word count histograms for text simply by counting the number of occurrences of every distinct word. **Signs of High Risk**: Areas of potential high risk include a significant proportion of missing or null values which may affect the model's performance. Also, predominance of a single value (low diversity) in a feature, high variance in a numeric feature, or high number of distinct categories in categorical features may signal problems with the model. High frequency of a particular word in text data could also indicate bias. **Strengths**: This test effectively provides a comprehensive, high-level summary of the dataset. It aids in understanding the distribution, dispersion, and central tendency of numeric features, and the frequency distribution in categorical and text features. It effectively handles different data types and provides insight into the variety and distribution of field values. **Limitations**: This metric doesn’t provide insights into the relationships between different fields or features; it only provides univariate analysis. The statistical description for text data is also quite limited, essentially being a bag-of-words model. The descriptive statistics like mean, standard deviation are not meaningful for ordinal categorical data. Lastly, this test does not inform on how the data will influence the model's performance.\nvalidmind.data_validation.DatasetDescription\n\n\nMetric\nScatter Plot\n**Purpose**: The purpose of this metric, ScatterPlot, is to provide a visual analysis of the input dataset by generating a scatter plot matrix. This scatter plot matrix includes all columns (or features) in the dataset and is intended to reveal relationships, patterns, or outliers among different features. This visual representation can give both qualitative and quantitative insights into the multidimensional relationships in the dataset, which can be useful in understanding the suitability and effectiveness of selected features for model training. **Test Mechanism**: The ScatterPlot class utilizes the seaborn library to generate the scatter plot matrix. It first retrieves all columns from the input dataset, ensures that the specified columns exist in the dataset, and then creates a pairplot for these columns. It uses the kernel density estimate (kde) for a smoother, univariate distribution along the diagonal of the grid. The final plot is stored in an array of Figure objects, each encapsulating matplotlib figure instance for storage and later usage. **Signs of High Risk**: Signs of potential risk could be the appearance of non-linear or random patterns across different feature pairs indicating complex relationships not suitable for linear assumptions. Additionally, showing no clear patterns or clusters might indicate weak or non-existent correlations among features, posing a challenge for certain model types. Visualization of outliers may also be a sign of risk as outliers can negatively impact model performance. **Strengths**: The utilization of a scatter plot matrix for data analysis provides various strengths: 1. It provides visual insight into the multidimensional relationships among multiple features. 2. It helps to identify trends, correlations, and outliers that could impact model performance. 3. As a diagnostic tool, it can suggest whether certain assumptions taken during model creation (like linearity) are valid. 4. It is versatile and can be used for both classification and regression type tasks. **Limitations**: Scatter plot matrices, however, also present a few limitations: 1. They can become highly cluttered and difficult to interpret as the number of features (columns) increases. 2. They primarily reveal pairwise relationships and might not expose complex interactions involving more than two features. 3. Since it is a visual tool, quantitative analysis might not be precise. 4. Outliers, if not clearly visible, can be overlooked, affecting model performance. 5. It assumes that the dataset fits into memory, which might not be the case for extremely large datasets.\nvalidmind.data_validation.ScatterPlot\n\n\nThresholdTest\nTime Series Outliers\n**Purpose**: This test is designed to identify outliers in time-series data using the z-score method. It's vital for ensuring data quality before modeling, as outliers can skew predictive models and significantly impact their overall performance. **Test Mechanism**: The test processes a given dataset which must have datetime indexing, checks if a 'zscore_threshold' parameter has been supplied, and identifies columns with numeric data types. After finding numeric columns, the implementer then applies the z-score method to each numeric column, identifying outliers based on the threshold provided. Each outlier is listed together with their variable name, z-score, timestamp and relative threshold in a dictionary and converted to a DataFrame for convenient output. Additionally, it produces visual plots for each time series illustrating outliers in the context of the broader dataset. The 'zscore_threshold' parameter sets the limit beyond which a data point will be labeled as an outlier. The default threshold is set at 3, indicating that any data point that falls 3 standard deviations away from the mean will be marked as an outlier. **Signs of High Risk**: If many or substantial outliers are present within a dataset, this may be an indicator of high risk as it suggests that the dataset contains significant anomalies. This could potentially affect the performance of the machine learning models, if not properly addressed. Data points with z-scores higher than the set threshold would be flagged as outliers and could be considered as high risk. **Strengths**: 1. The z-score method is a popular and robust method for identifying outliers in a dataset. 2. Time series maintenance is simplified through requiring a datetime index. 3. Outliers are identified for each numeric feature individually. 4. Provides an elaborate report which shows variables, date, z-score and whether the test passed or failed. 5. Offers visual inspection for detected outliers in the respective time-series through plots. **Limitations**: 1. This test only identifies outliers in numeric columns, and won't identify outliers in categorical variables. 2. The utility and accuracy of z-scores can be limited if the data doesn’t follow a normal distribution. 3. The method relies on a subjective z-score threshold for deciding what constitutes an outlier, which might not always be suitable depending on the dataset and the use case. 4. It does not address possible ways to handle identified outliers in the data. 5. The necessity for a datetime index could limit the extent of its application.\nvalidmind.data_validation.TimeSeriesOutliers\n\n\nMetric\nTabular Categorical Bar Plots\n**Purpose**: The purpose of this metric is to visually analyze categorical data using bar plots. It is intended to evaluate the dataset's composition by displaying the counts of each category in each categorical feature. **Test Mechanism**: The provided dataset is first checked to determine if it contains any categorical variables. If no categorical columns are found, the tool raises a ValueError. For each categorical variable in the dataset, a separate bar plot is generated. The number of occurrences for each category is calculated and displayed on the plot. If a dataset contains multiple categorical columns, multiple bar plots are produced. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk could occur if the categorical variables exhibit an extreme imbalance, with categories having very few instances possibly being underrepresented in the model, which could affect the model's performance and its ability to generalize. Another sign of risk is if there are too many categories in a single variable, which could lead to overfitting and make the model complex. **Strengths**: This metric provides a visual and intuitively understandable representation of categorical data, which aids in the analysis of variable distributions. By presenting model inputs in this way, we can easily identify imbalances or rare categories that could affect the model's performance. **Limitations**: This method only works with categorical data, meaning it won't apply to numerical variables. In addition, the method does not provide any informative value when there are too many categories, as the bar chart could become cluttered and hard to interpret. It offers no insights into the model's performance or precision, but rather provides a descriptive analysis of the input.\nvalidmind.data_validation.TabularCategoricalBarPlots\n\n\nMetric\nAuto Stationarity\n**Purpose**: This test, AutoStationarity, is used to automatically detect and evaluate the stationarity of each time series in a Dataframe, using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. Stationarity is a crucial property in time series data, which indicates that a series' statistical features such as mean and variance are constant over time. This property is an underlying assumption for many time-series models. **Test Mechanism**: The test performs the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test on each time series in a provided DataFrame to determine if the time series is stationary. A loop is ran over each column (time series) of the DataFrame. For each series, the ADF test is performed up to a maximum order of differencing (default value 5, configurable via params). The p-value of the ADF test is compared against a predefined threshold (default value 0.05, configurable via params). If the p-value is less than the threshold, the series is considered stationary at the current order of differencing. **Signs of High Risk**: The high risk or failure in the model's performance may be indicated by a significant number of series failing to achieve stationarity up to the maximum order of differencing. This might suggest that the series are not well-modeled by a stationary process and other modeling strategies might be needed. **Strengths**: By automating the ADF test, this metric allows for the mass analysis of stationarity across a multitude of time series, greatly increasing the efficiency and reliability of the analysis. The use of the ADF test, a commonly accepted method for testing stationarity, gives credibility to the results. Furthermore, the implementation of max order and threshold parameters allows users to specify their preferred level of strictness in the tests. **Limitations**: The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test and stationarity check generally have limitations. They rely on the assumption that the series are well-modeled by an autoregressive process, which may not be the case for all time series. The stationarity check is also sensitive to the choice of the threshold value for the significance level. Too high or too low threshold may lead to erroneous conclusions about stationary properties. There is also a risk of over-differencing if the maximum order is set too high, leading to unnecessary cycles.\nvalidmind.data_validation.AutoStationarity\n\n\nMetric\nDescriptive Statistics\n**Purpose**: The purpose of the Descriptive Statistics metric is to provide a comprehensive summary of both numerical and categorical data within a dataset. For numerical data, it gathers statistics such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values, as well as certain percentiles. For categorical data, it calculates the count, number of unique values, most frequent value, frequency of the most common value, and the proportion of the most frequent value relative to the total. This metric aids in visualizing the overall distribution of the variables in the dataset, which in turn assists in understanding the model's behavior and predicting its performance. **Test Mechanism**: The test mechanism involves using the describe() function for numerical fields which computes several summary statistics and value_counts() for categorical fields which counts unique values. Both of these functions are built-in methods of pandas dataframes. The results are then formatted to create two separate tables, one for numerical and one for categorical variable summaries. These tables provide a clear summary of the main characteristics of these variables, which can be crucial in assessing the model's performance. **Signs of High Risk**: High risks can be found in evidence of skewed data or notable outliers. This could be reflected in the mean and median (50% percentile) having a significant difference, in the case of numerical data. For categorical data, high risk can be indicated by a lack of diversity (low count of unique values), or overdominance of a single category (high frequency of the top value). **Strengths**: The primary strength of this metric lies in its ability to provide a comprehensive summary of the dataset, providing insights on the distribution and characteristics of the variables under consideration. It is a flexible and robust method, relevant to both numerical and categorical data. It can help highlight anomalies such as outliers, extreme skewness, or lack of diversity which can be essential in understanding model behavior during testing and validation. **Limitations**: While this metric provides a high-level overview of the data, it may not be sufficient to detect subtle correlations or complex patterns in the data. It does not provide any info on the relationship between variables. Plus, descriptive statistics alone cannot be used to infer properties about future unseen data. It should be used in conjunction with other statistical tests to provide a thorough understanding of the model's data.\nvalidmind.data_validation.DescriptiveStatistics\n\n\nMetric\nANOVA One Way Table\n**Purpose**: The ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) One Way Table metric is used to evaluate whether the mean of numerical variables differs across different groups identified by the target or categorical variables. It plays a key role in identifying whether categorical variables have a significant effect on the numerical variables of interest. This metric helps in understanding and detecting features that are statistically significant with regard to the target variable in a given dataset. **Test Mechanism**: This metric performs an ANOVA F-test on each of the numerical variables against the target. Should no specific features be indicated, the test is conducted on all numerical features. A p-value is generated for each test and compared against a specified threshold, defaulting to 0.05 if none is given. The feature is marked as 'Pass' if the p-value is less than or equal to the specified threshold, indicating that there is a significant difference in the means of the groups, and 'Fail' otherwise. The test results are returned in a DataFrame indicating the variable name, F statistic value, p-value, threshold, and pass/fail status for each numerical variable. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or failure in the model may be indicated by a large number of 'Fail' results in the ANOVA F-test. This suggests that many numerical variables in the dataset display no statistically significant difference across the target variable groups, potentially leading to underperforming predictions. Additionally, features with high p-values also indicate a high risk as they display a larger chance of obtaining the observed data given that the null hypothesis is true. **Strengths**: - The ANOVA One Way Table is an efficient tool in identifying statistically significant features as it compares the means of multiple groups simultaneously. - This metric is flexible and can handle situations where numerical features have not been specified by testing all numerical features in the dataset. - It provides a convenient way to measure the statistical significance of numerical variables and assists in picking those variables that significantly influence the classifier's predictions. **Limitations**: - The ANOVA One Way Table metric assumes that the data is normally distributed, which might not be the case, potentially leading to inaccurate test results. - The F-test is sensitive to variance changes, and therefore, this metric might not perform well in datasets with high variance. - The ANOVA One Way test does not indicate which specific group means are statistically different from each other; it merely tells that there is a difference. - The metric does not provide insight into interactions between variables, and it might fail to detect significant effects due to these interactions.\nvalidmind.data_validation.ANOVAOneWayTable\n\n\nMetric\nTarget Rate Bar Plots\n**Purpose**: The purpose of this metric is to visually summarize the distinct categorizations made by a classification-oriented machine learning model. Specifically, it generates bar plots representing target rate ratios for different categorical variables within the input dataset. This makes it easier to evaluate the performance of the classification model and gain quick insights into its accuracy. **Test Mechanism**: The test mechanic involves the creation of two bar plots for each categorical feature in the dataset. The first plot counts the number of times each category appears in the dataset, using a unique color to facilitate identification. On the second plot, it calculates the average target rate for each category and plots these averages. The target rate value comes from the column specified as \"default_column.\" The plots are generated using the Plotly library in Python, with subplots created for each feature. If no specific columns are indicated, all categorical feature columns in the dataset will be used to generate the plot. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or failure signs might involve inconsistent or non-binary values in the \"default_column,\" making it difficult to calculate a meaningful default rate. Another risk sign could be an unusually low or high default rate for any particular category, suggesting the model might be wrongly classifying data points for those categories. **Strengths**: The main strength of this metric is its ability to provide a clear, visual representation of the model's categorization patterns. This helps stakeholders spot anomalies, inconsistencies, or trends in model behavior quickly. The metric is also flexible, allowing for the examination of a single column or multiple columns in the data. **Limitations**: This metric only works well with categorical data, limiting its application to numeric or continuous variables. It also assumes binary target values (only 0s and 1s), making it less useful for multi-class problems. The bar plots can become confusing and less interpretable if the dataset has too many distinct categories.\nvalidmind.data_validation.TargetRateBarPlots\n\n\nMetric\nPearson Correlation Matrix\n**Purpose**: This test is intended to evaluate the extent of linear dependency between all pairs of numerical variables in the given dataset. It provides the Pearson Correlation coefficient, which reveals any high correlations present. The purpose of doing this is to identify potential redundancy, as variables that are highly correlated can often be removed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset without significantly impacting the model's performance. **Test Mechanism**: This metric test generates a correlation matrix for all numerical variables in the dataset using the Pearson correlation formula. A heat map is subsequently created to visualize this matrix effectively. The color of each point on the heat map corresponds to the magnitude and direction (positive or negative) of the correlation, with a range from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation). Any correlation coefficients higher than 0.7 (in absolute terms) are indicated in white in the heat map, suggesting a high degree of correlation. **Signs of High Risk**: High-risk signs pertaining to this metric might include a large number of variables in the dataset showing a high degree of correlation (coefficients approaching ±1). This indicates redundancy within the dataset, suggesting that some variables may not be contributing new information to the model. This could potentially lead to overfitting. **Strengths**: The primary strength of this metric test is its ability to detect and quantify the linearity of relationships between variables. This allows for the identification of redundant variables, which in turn can help in simplifying models and potentially improving their performance. The visualization aspect (heatmap) is another strength as it offers an easy-to-understand overview of the correlations, beneficial for those not comfortable navigating numerical matrices. **Limitations**: The primary limitation of Pearson Correlation is its inability to detect non-linear relationships between variables, which can lead to missed opportunities for dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, it only measures the degree of linear relationship and not the strength of effect of one variable on the other. The cutoff value of 0.7 for high correlation is a somewhat arbitrary choice and some valid dependencies might be missed if they have a correlation coefficient less than this value.\nvalidmind.data_validation.PearsonCorrelationMatrix\n\n\nMetric\nFeature Target Correlation Plot\n**Purpose**: The purpose of this test is to visually analyze and display the correlations between different input features and the target output of a Machine Learning model. This is important in understanding how each feature impacts the model's predictions. A high correlation means the feature strongly influences the target variable - something particularly useful in feature selection and understanding model behaviour. **Test Mechanism**: The FeatureTargetCorrelationPlot test computes correlations between features and the target variable of a given dataset. The correlations are calculated and then plotted in a horizontal bar graph, with color varying according to the strength of the correlation. An automatic hover template is also provided for descriptive tooltips. The features to be analyzed can be specified, and the graph's height can be adjusted per requirement. **Signs of High Risk**: Absence of any strong correlations (either positive or negative) between features and the target variable might suggest a high risk as it indicates that the given features don't have a significant influence on the prediction output. Also, duplication of correlation values might indicate redundancy in feature selection. **Strengths**: This test provides a visual aid, significantly improving the interpretation of correlations and giving a clear, easy-to-understand overview of how each feature impacts the model's target variable. This aids in feature selection and in understanding the nature of model predictions. Additionally, the hover template provides precise correlation values for each feature, essential for a granular level understanding. **Limitations**: The test only works with numerical data, so variables of other types must be preprocessed. Also, the plot assumes a linear correlation - it cannot efficiently capture non-linear relationships. One more limitation is that it may not accurately reflect importance for models that use complex interactions of features, like Decision Trees or Neural Networks.\nvalidmind.data_validation.FeatureTargetCorrelationPlot\n\n\nMetric\nTabular Numerical Histograms\n**Purpose**: The purpose of this test is to provide visual analysis of numerical data through the generation of histograms for each numerical feature in the dataset. Histograms aid in the exploratory analysis of data, offering insight into the distribution of the data, skewness, presence of outliers, and central tendencies. It helps in understanding if the inputs to the model are normally distributed which is a common assumption in many machine learning algorithms. **Test Mechanism**: This test scans the provided dataset and extracts all the numerical columns. For each numerical column, it constructs a histogram using plotly, with 50 bins. The deployment of histograms offers a robust visual aid, ensuring unruffled identification and understanding of numerical data distribution patterns. **Signs of High Risk**: A high degree of skewness, unexpected data distributions or existence of extreme outliers in the histograms may indicate issues with the data that the model is receiving. If data for a numerical feature is expected to follow a certain distribution (like normal distribution) but does not, it could lead to sub-par performance by the model. As such these instances should be treated as high-risk indicators. **Strengths**: This test offers several advantages: - It provides a simple, easy-to-interpret visualization of how data for each numerical attribute is distributed. - It can help detect skewed values and outliers, that could potentially harm the AI model's performance. - It can be applied to large datasets and multiple numerical variables conveniently. **Limitations**: Despite its effectiveness, this test does have some limitations: - It only works with numerical data, thus ignoring non-numerical or categorical data. - It does not analyze relationships between different features, only the individual feature distributions. - It is a univariate analysis, and may miss patterns or anomalies that only appear when considering multiple variables together. - It does not provide any insight into how these features affect the output of the model; it is purely an input analysis tool.\nvalidmind.data_validation.TabularNumericalHistograms\n\n\nMetric\nIsolation Forest Outliers\n**Purpose**: The purpose of the `IsolationForestOutliers` test is to identify anomalies or outliers in the model's dataset. It assumes anomalous data points, due to their distinctive properties, can be detected more quickly by the isolation forest algorithm. This algorithm evaluates anomalies through the creation of isolation trees and identifying instances with shorter average path lengths in these trees, as these instances are expected to be different from the majority of the data points. **Test Mechanism**: This test uses the isolation forest algorithm, which isolates anomalies rather than identifying normal data points. It runs by building an ensemble of isolation trees, utilizing binary trees created by randomly selecting features and splitting the data based on random thresholds. For each pair of variables, it generates a scatter plot distinguishing the identified outliers from the inliers. The test results are visualized in these scatter plots showing the distinction of outliers from inliers. **Signs of High Risk**: Signs of high risk or failure in the model's performance might be the presence of high contamination which indicates a lot of anomalies, an inability to detect clusters of anomalies that are geographically close in the feature space, detecting normal instances as anomalies or overlooking actual anomalies. **Strengths**: The strengths of the isolation forest algorithm include its ability to handle large high-dimensional datasets, its efficiency in isolating anomalies rather than normal instances tradition, and its insensitivity to the underlying distribution of data. It is able to recognize anomalies even when they are not separated from the data cloud by identifying distinctive properties of the anomalies. Additionally, it visualizes the test results, aiding understanding and interpretability. **Limitations**: Among its limitations, the isolation forest test might find it hard to detect anomalies that are close to each other, or in datasets where anomalies are more prevalent. The results strongly rely on the contamination parameter, which might need fine-tuning to be effective. It may also not be effective in detecting collective anomalies if they behave similarly to normal data. Furthermore, it potentially lacks precision in identifying which features contribute most to the anomalous behavior.\nvalidmind.data_validation.IsolationForestOutliers\n\n\nMetric\nChi Squared Features Table\n**Purpose**: The purpose of this metric, `ChiSquaredFeaturesTable`, is to perform a Chi-Squared test of independence for each categorical feature variable with a given target column. The Chi-Squared test is designed to determine if there's a significant association between the categorical features and the target variable. It is typically used in the context of Model Risk Management to comprehend feature relevance and identify potential bias in a classification model. **Test Mechanism**: This test involves creating a contingency table for each categorical variable and the target variable, and then performing a Chi-Squared test. The Chi-Squared statistic and the p-value for each feature are calculated using this method. The p-value threshold is a parameter that can be adjusted, and a test will pass if the p-value is less than or equal to this threshold. If not, the test will fail. The test result for each feature - consisting of variable name, Chi-squared statistic, p-value, threshold, and pass/fail status - is aggregated into a final summary table. **Signs of High Risk**: Red Flags for high risk include high p-values (greater than the set threshold) for certain variables. These high p-values suggest there is not a statistically significant relationship between the feature and the target variables, resulting in a 'Fail' status. If a categorical feature has no relevant association with the target variable, it can signal that the machine learning model may not be performing well. **Strengths**: This test allows for a thorough examination of the interaction between a model's input features and the target output, helping to validate the relevance of the categorical features. It also provides a clear 'Pass/Fail' output for each categorical feature. The ability to adjust the p-value threshold adds flexibility to suit different statistical standards. **Limitations**: The metric assumes that the data is tabular and categorical, which may not apply to all datasets. It is specifically designed for classification tasks and not suitable for regression scenarios. It's also important to remember that the Chi-squared test, like any test based on hypothesis testing, is not able to identify causal relationships; it can only reveal associations. Moreover, the test relies on an adjustable p-value threshold, and different threshold choices may lead to different conclusions about feature relevance.\nvalidmind.data_validation.ChiSquaredFeaturesTable\n\n\nThresholdTest\nHigh Cardinality\n**Purpose**: The “High Cardinality” test functions to assess and evaluate the number of unique values present in the categorical columns of a dataset. Cardinality represents the measure of distinct elements residing in a set. In context of this test, high cardinality implies presence of a large quantity of unique, non-repetitive values in the dataset. **Test Mechanism**: This test begins by inferring the type of the dataset and initializing numeric threshold based on the test parameters. If the “threshold_type” is set to “percent”, it calculates the numeric threshold as the product of “percent_threshold” and the count of rows in the dataset. Subsequently, the test commences iteration through each column in the dataset. It limits the evaluation to those columns which are categorized as \"Categorical\". For each categorical column, the number of distinct values (n_distinct) and the percentage of distinct values (p_distinct) are computed. The test asserts success if n_distinct is less than the calculated numeric threshold. The summary method compiles results in tabulated form, with details for each column including column name, number of distinct values, percentage of distinct values, and pass/fail status. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or failure in model performance may be indicated by a large number of distinct values (high cardinality) in one or more categorical columns. If any column fails the test (n_distinct &gt;= num_threshold), it is a sign of high risk. **Strengths**: The High Cardinality test is valuable in detecting overfitting risks and potential noise. High cardinality in categorical variables may trigger overfitting in machine learning models as the models can excessively adapt to the training data. It also helps in identifying potential outliers and inconsistencies, therefore aids in enhancing the data quality. It can be applied to both classification and regression task types, which lends versatility to the test. **Limitations**: Despite its numerous benefits, the High Cardinality test has certain limitations. It is solely applicable to \"Categorical\" data types, and not suitable for numerical or continuous features, limiting its scope. Furthermore, the test does not inherently assert the relevance or importance of unique values in categorical features, thus critical data points may be overlooked. The threshold (both number and percent) used for the test is static and likely to be non-optimal for diverse datasets and applications, it might benefit from additional mechanisms to adapt and fine-tune this dynamic.\nvalidmind.data_validation.HighCardinality\n\n\nThresholdTest\nMissing Values\n**Purpose**: This test is designed to measure the number of missing values in the dataset across all the features. This offers a way to evaluate the data quality, which is crucial to the predictive strength and reliability of any machine learning model. It aims to ensure that the ratio of missing data to total data is less than a predefined threshold, which in this case defaults to 1. **Test Mechanism**: The test iteratively runs through each column in the dataset, counting the number of missing values (NaNs) and calculating the percentage of missing values compared to the total number of rows. It then checks if the number of missing values is less than the pre-defined `min_threshold`. The results are summarized in a table that lists each column, the number of missing values, the percentage of missing values in each column, and a Pass/Fail status based on the comparison with the threshold. **Signs of High Risk**: A high risk is indicated when the number of missing values in any column exceeds the `min_threshold` value. Another sign of high risk is when there are missing values spread across many columns. In both cases, the test would issue a \"Fail\" mark on the Pass/Fail status. **Strengths**: This test helps to identify the presence and extent of missing data quickly and at a granular level (each feature in the dataset). It provides an effective and straightforward way to maintain data quality, which is crucial for building effective machine learning models. **Limitations**: While the test can efficiently detect missing data, it does not address the root causes of these missing values or suggest ways to impute or handle such values. It also does not consider situations where a feature has a significant amount of missing values, but still less than the `min_threshold`, which might also affect the model in cases where `min_threshold` is set too high. Lastly, this test does not account for data encoded as values (e.g., \"-999\" or \"None\"), which may technically not be missing but could carry the same implications.\nvalidmind.data_validation.MissingValues\n\n\nMetric\nDefault Ratesby Risk Band Plot\n**Purpose**: The Default Rates by Risk Band Plot metric is designed to measure and visualize default rates across different risk bands in a given dataset. This measurement is critical in evaluating the performance of credit risk models, allowing users to understand and compare default rates across diverse categories of risk. **Test Mechanism**: The test is conducted through a computed bar plot. The plot is generated by first calculating the count of accounts in each risk band, converting these counts into percentages by dividing by the total number of accounts, and then visualizing these percentages in the form of a bar plot. The bar plot thereby clearly indicates the percentage of total accounts associated with each risk band, providing a visual summary of default risk across these bands. The plot uses the 'Dark24' color sequence to ensure distinguishable colors for each risk band. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk is indicated with a high percentage of accounts associated with high-risk bands. The higher the percentage of accounts in these bands, the higher the exposure to default risk in the dataset. This could suggest potential failures in the model's ability to effectively manage or predict credit risk. **Strengths**: The main strengths of this metric are its simplicity and its visual impact. By graphically displaying the default rates, the metric provides a clear visual aid for understanding the spread of default risk across risk bands. The use of a bar chart provides an easy comparison between the different risk bands, helping to highlight any imbalances or areas of high risk. This helps to draw attention to any disproportions or anomalies in the data, making it easier to evaluate and compare the performance of credit risk models. **Limitations**: The main limitation of this metric is that it doesn't provide any insights into why certain risk bands have higher default rates. Additionally, it might not accurately represent the distribution of risk if some risk bands have significantly more accounts than others. It also doesn't consider other factors contributing to credit risk outside of the risk bands. Finally, the metric's reliance on visualization means that the results could be misinterpreted if not carefully analyzed, as graphical representations can sometimes be misleading.\nvalidmind.data_validation.DefaultRatesbyRiskBandPlot\n\n\nMetric\nRolling Stats Plot\n**Purpose**: The `RollingStatsPlot` metric is used to assess the stationarity of time series data in a given dataset. More specifically, the metric evaluates the rolling mean and rolling standard deviation of the dataset over a defined window size. The rolling mean is a measure of the average trend in the data, while the rolling standard deviation assesses the data's volatility within the window. These measures are critical for preparing time series data for modeling as they provide insights into the behavior of the data over time. **Test Mechanism**: The testing mechanism is divided into two steps. Firstly, the rolling mean and standard deviation for each column of the dataset are calculated over a window size, specified by the user or defaulted to 12 data points. Secondly, the rolling mean and standard deviation are plotted separately, thus visualizing the trends and volatility in the dataset. A basic check is performed to ensure that the columns exist in the dataset and that the provided dataset is indexed by date and time, which is a requirement for time series analysis. **Signs of High Risk**: Signs that could indicate high risk include: 1. A non-stationary pattern in either the rolling mean or the rolling standard deviation plot. This might mean that the data has trends or seasonality, which could affect the performance of time series models. 2. Missing columns in the dataset, which would prevent the metric from running successfully. 3. The presence of NaN values in the dataset. These might need to be handled before the metric can proceed. **Strengths**: The strengths of this metric include: 1. Providing visualizations of the data's trending behaviour and volatility, which can aid in understanding the overall characteristics of the data. 2. Checking the integrity of the dataset (whether all designated columns exist, and that the index is of datetime type). 3. Adapting to various window sizes, which allows for flexibility in analysing data with different temporal granularities. 4. Accommodating multi-feature datasets by considering each column of the data individually. **Limitations**: Some limitations of the `RollingStatsPlot` metric include: 1. A fixed window size is used for all columns, which may not accurately capture the patterns in datasets where different features have different optimal window sizes. 2. The metric requires the dataset to be indexed by date and time, hence may not be applicable to datasets without a timestamp index. 3. The metrics primarily serve for data visualization. It does not provide any quantitative measures for stationarity, such as statistical tests. Thus, interpretation is subjective and depends on the discretion of the modeler.\nvalidmind.data_validation.RollingStatsPlot\n\n\nMetric\nDataset Correlations\n**Purpose**: The DatasetCorrelations metric is employed to examine the relationship between variables in a dataset, specifically designed for numerical and categorical data types. Using Pearson's R, Cramer's V, and Correlation ratios, it helps in understanding the linear relationship between numerical variables, association between categorical ones, and between numerical-categorical variables respectively. This allows for better awareness regarding dependency between features, which is crucial for optimizing model performance and understanding the model's behavior and predictors. **Test Mechanism**: During its execution, DatasetCorrelations initiates the calculation of the aforementioned correlation coefficients for the provided dataset. It leverages the built-in method 'get_correlations()', populating the 'correlations' attribute in the dataset object. It then invokes 'get_correlation_plots()' to generate graphical representations of these correlations. Finally, the correlation details and figures are cached for further study and analysis. The test does not dictate specific thresholds or grading scales. **Signs of High Risk**: Signs of high risk might involve the presence of high correlation levels between input variables (multicollinearity), which can jeopardize the interpretability of the model and lead to overfitting. Additionally, the absence of any significant correlations, which suggests that the variables might not have predictive power. **Strengths**: The test boasts the advantage of being comprehensive; it covers the correlation study of numerical, categorical, and numerical-categorical variables. Thus, it negates the need for multiple individual tests. Furthermore, it not only provides numerical correlation values, but also visualization plots, aiding in a more intuitive understanding of relationships between variables. **Limitations**: This metric, however, is limited by the fact that it only detects linear relationships and associations; nonlinear relationships may go unnoticed. Also, given the absence of specified thresholds for determining correlation significance, the interpretation of the results is dependent on the user's expertise. Lastly, it doesn't handle missing values in the dataset, which need to be treated beforehand.\nvalidmind.data_validation.DatasetCorrelations\n\n\nMetric\nTabular Description Tables\n**Purpose**: The primarily purpose of this metric is to gather and present descriptive statistics for numerical, categorical and datetime variables from a given dataset. This helps in understanding the core traits of the dataset like the count, mean, min, max, percentage of missing values, data types of fields, unique values in case of categorical fields, amongst other descriptors. **Test Mechanism**: The methodology for this metric involves first segregating the variables in the dataset into their data types - numerical, categorical or datetime. Once they are segregated, the metric gathers the summary statistics for each variable type. The capture of these summary statistics varies depending upon the type of variable. For numerical variables, it extracts descriptors like count, mean, min, max, count of missing values and data type. For categorical variables, it extracts descriptors like count, number of unique values, display of unique values, count of missing values, and data type. For datetime variables, it extracts descriptors like count, number of unique values, earliest and latest date, count of missing values and data type. **Signs of High Risk**: There could be signs of high risk or failure when a substantial number of missing values is observed in the descriptive statistics results. It signals potential issues regarding data collection, integrity, and quality. Other red signals could include seeing inappropriate distributions for numerical variables (like having negative values for a variable that should always be positive), or finding inappropriate data types (like a continuous variable encoded as a categorical type). **Strengths**: This metric provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset. It not only gives a snapshot into the essence of the numerical, categorical, and datetime fields respectively but also identifies potential data quality issues such as missing values or inconsistencies which are crucial for building credible machine learning models. The metadata, notably the data type and missing value information, are vital for anyone including data scientists dealing with the dataset before the modeling process. **Limitations**: However, the limitations of this metric include not performing any deeper statistical analysis or tests on the data. It doesn't handle issues such as outliers, or relationships between variables. It does not offer insights into potential correlations or possible interactions between variables. It also stays silent on the potential impact of missing values on the performance of the machine learning models. Furthermore, it doesn’t investigate potential transformation requirements that may be necessary to enhance the performance of the chosen algorithm.\nvalidmind.data_validation.TabularDescriptionTables\n\n\nMetric\nAuto MA\n**Purpose**: The primary role of the `AutoMA` metric is to automatically determine the optimal Moving Average (MA) order for each variable in the time series dataset. The decision of MA order is based on minimizing BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) and AIC (Akaike Information Criterion); both are statistical tools for model choice. Before the fitting process begins, a stationarity test (Augmented Dickey-Fuller test) is conducted on each series. **Test Mechanism**: First, the `AutoMA` algorithm checks whether the `max_ma_order` parameter is provided. It then loops over all variables in the dataset, performing the Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity. For each variable (if stationary), it fits an ARIMA model for orders running from 0 to `max_ma_order`. The output is a list showing BIC and AIC values of the ARIMA models with different orders. For each variable, the MA order that offers the smallest BIC is selected as the *best MA order*. The final results include a table summarizing the auto MA analysis and a table listing the best MA order for each variable. **Signs of High Risk**: - If a series is non-stationary (p-value&gt;0.05 in the Dickey-Fuller test), the result might be inaccurate. - Any error while fitting the ARIMA models, especially with higher MA order, could indicate possible risks and might require further investigation. **Strengths**: - This metric is beneficial for automating the selection process of the MA order for time series forecasting, thus saving time and effort usually required in manual hyperparameter tuning. - It applies both BIC and AIC, enhancing the chance of selecting the most suitable model. - It checks for stationarity of the series prior to model fitting, ensuring that the underlying assumptions of the MA model are met. **Limitations**: - If the time series is not stationary, the metric would provide inaccurate results. This limitation necessitates pre-processing steps to stabilize the series before ARIMA model fitting. - This metric uses a rudimentary model selection approach based on BIC and does not consider other possible model selection strategies, which might be more appropriate depending on the specific dataset. - The 'max_ma_order' parameter must be manually set, which may not always guarantee the best performance, especially if set too low. - The computation time raises with the increase in `max_ma_order`, thus the metric can be computationally expensive for larger values.\nvalidmind.data_validation.AutoMA\n\n\nThresholdTest\nUnique Rows\n**Purpose**: The purpose of the UniqueRows test is to assess the quality of the data that is being fed into the ML model, specifically by checking that the number of unique rows in the dataset exceeds a certain threshold in order to ensure diversity in the data. This is important as having a diverse range of data is crucial in training an unbiased and robust model that performs well on unseen data. **Test Mechanism**: The testing mechanism first calculates the total number of rows in the dataset. Then, for each column in the dataset, the number of unique rows is counted. The test passes if the percentage of unique rows (calculated as the number of unique rows divided by the total number of rows) is less than the predefined minimum percent threshold provided as a parameter to the function. The results are then cached, and an overall pass or fail is issued based on whether all columns have passed the test. **Signs of High Risk**: Signs of high risk include columns of data where the number of unique rows is less than the predefined minimum percent threshold. This lack of diversity in the data can be seen as an indicator of poor data quality, which could potentially lead to model overfitting and a poor generalization ability, thereby posing a high risk. **Strengths**: The Strengths of the UniqueRows test include its ability to quickly and efficiently evaluate the diversity of data across each column in the dataset. It allows an easy and systematic way to check data quality in terms of uniqueness, which can be a critical aspect in creating an effective and unbiased ML model. **Limitations**: One limitation of the UniqueRows test is that it assumes that the quality of the data is directly proportional to its uniqueness, which may not always be the case. There might be scenarios where certain non-unique rows are important and shouldn't be discounted. Also, it doesn’t take into account the 'importance' of each column in predicting the output and treats all columns equally. Finally, this test will not be useful or appropriate for categorical variables where the number of unique categories is naturally limited.\nvalidmind.data_validation.UniqueRows\n\n\nThresholdTest\nToo Many Zero Values\n**Purpose**: The 'TooManyZeroValues' test is used to identify numerical columns in the data that have an abundance of zero values. If a column has too many zeros, it could indicate data sparsity or potential lack of variation, which may limit its utility in a machine learning model. The test quantifies 'too many' as a percentage of total values, set by default to 3%. **Test Mechanism**: The application of this test involves iterating over each column of the dataset and determining if the column corresponds to numerical data. When a numeric column is identified, the function calculates the total count of zero values and their ratio to the total row number. If the proportion exceeds the preset threshold parameter (default 0.03 or 3%), the column fails the test. The results from each column are summarised in a report that indicates the number and the percentage of zero values for each numeric column, along with whether the column passed or failed the test. **Signs of High Risk**: The indicators of high risk associated with this test include: 1. Numeric columns with a high ratio of zero values to the total number of rows (beyond the set threshold). 2. Columns where all values registered are zero, implying a complete lack of data variation. **Strengths**: This test offers several advantages: 1. Helps in identifying columns with excessive zero values which otherwise might go unnoticed in a large dataset. 2. Offers flexibility to adjust the threshold of what counts as 'too many' zero values, accommodating the specific needs of a given analysis or model. 3. Reports both the count and percentage of zero values, shedding more light on the distribution and proportion of zeros within a column. 4. Focuses specifically on numerical data, preventing the misapplication to non-numerical columns and avoiding false test failures. **Limitations**: Certain limitation of this metric include: 1. It merely checks for zero values and does not assess the relevance or the impact of other potentially problematic values in the dataset such as extremely high or extremely low numbers, null values or outliers. 2. It cannot detect a pattern of zeros, which might be important in time series or longitudinal data. 3. Zeroes might be meaningful in certain contexts, so labelling them as 'too many' could be a misinterpretation of the data. 4. This test does not account for the dataset’s context and disregards that for certain columns, a high presence of zero values could be normal and does not necessarily indicate low data quality. 5. Cannot evaluate non-numerical or categorical columns, that might carry different types of concerns or issues.\nvalidmind.data_validation.TooManyZeroValues\n\n\nThresholdTest\nHigh Pearson Correlation\n**Purpose**: The Pearson Correlation test is intended to measure the linear relationship between features in the dataset, specifically ensuring that the pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients do not surpass a certain threshold. High correlation between two variables might indicate redundancy or multicollinearity. Identifying such correlations can alert the risk management team or developers about issues in the dataset which may have an impact on the performance and interpretability of the Machine Learning model. **Test Mechanism**: This Python implementation of the test first generates pairwise Pearson correlations for all the features in the dataset. It then sorts these correlations and eliminates duplicate and self-correlations (where a feature is correlated with itself). A Pass or Fail is assigned based on whether the absolute value of the correlation coefficient exceeds a predefined threshold (default to 0.3). The top 10 strongest correlations, regardless of whether they pass or fail, are returned. **Signs of High Risk**: The presence of correlation coefficients exceeding the specified threshold indicates high risk. This means that the features share a strong linear relationship, leading to potential multicollinearity and model overfitting. Redundancy of variables can undermine the interpretability of the model because it’s unclear which variable's predictive power is true. **Strengths**: - The Pearson Correlation test is a simple and fast way to identify pairwise relationships between features. - Provides clear output: Results show the pairs of correlated variables along with their Pearson correlation coefficient and a Pass or Fail status. - Helps in early identification of potential multicollinearity issues which can impact model training. **Limitations**: - Limited to linear relationships only: Pearson correlation cannot depict non-linear relationships or dependencies. - Sensitive to outliers: A few outliers can significantly change the correlation coefficient. - Redundancy identification only possible for pairwise correlation: If three or more variables are linearly dependent, this method might not identify that complex relationship. - Top 10 result limitation: It only keeps the top 10 high correlations, which might not fully capture the data's complexity. Configuration for the number of kept results needs to be implemented.\nvalidmind.data_validation.HighPearsonCorrelation\n\n\nMetric\nAC Fand PACF Plot\n**Purpose**: The ACF (Autocorrelation Function) and PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function) plot test is employed for analyzing time series data in machine learning models. These plots provide valuable insights about the data correlation over a period of time. The ACF plots the correlation of the series with its own lags, while the PACF plots correlations after removing the effects already explained by earlier lags. This helps in identifying the nature of the trend (for example, seasonality), degree of autocorrelation, and selecting order parameters for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. **Test Mechanism**: The python class `ACFandPACFPlot` receives a dataset with a time-based index. After checking that the index is of datetime type and dealing with any NaN values, it generates ACF and PACF plots for each column in the dataset, creating a subplot for each. In case the dataset does not include key columns, an error is thrown. **Signs of High Risk**: An indication of model risk in relation to the ACF and PACF plot test includes sudden drops in the correlation at a specific lag or consistent high correlation across multiple lags. Both could indicate non-stationarity in the data, which might suggest that the model estimated on this data might not generalize well to future data. **Strengths**: The ACF and PACF plots provide clear graphical representations of the correlation in time series data. This is particularly useful for identifying important characteristics such as seasonality, trends, and correlation patterns within the data. This allows for better model configuration, more specifically in the selection of parameters for ARIMA models. **Limitations**: ACF and PACF plots can only be used with time series data, and are thus not applicable to every ML model. Additionally, they require a large and consistent dataset, as gaps can lead to misleading results. These plots only show linear correlation, ignoring potential nonlinear relationships. Lastly, they may not be intuitive for non-experts to interpret and are not a substitute for more advanced analyses.\nvalidmind.data_validation.ACFandPACFPlot\n\n\nMetric\nBivariate Histograms\n**Purpose**: This metric is used for visual data analysis, specifically for inspecting the distribution of categorical variables. By presenting bivariate histograms, the metric assists in assessing correlations between variables and distributions within each defined target class, giving us intuitive insights into the data's traits and potential patterns. **Test Mechanism**: The BivariateHistograms module requires an input dataset and a set of feature pairs. For each pair of features in the dataset, a bivariate histogram is drawn using seaborn's histogram plotting function. This histogram separates the data by the status of the target column, optionally restricted to a specific status by the *target_filter* parameter. The module creates two histograms for each pair - one for each variable, where colors distinguish between different target statuses. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk signs would be irregular or unexpected distributions of data among categories. For instance, extremely skewed distributions, differing significantly from normal or expected distributions, or large discrepancies in distribution patterns between different target states, might all be reasons for concern. **Strengths**: The key strength of this test lies in its simplicity and visualization power. It provides a quick, consolidated view of data distributions across different target conditions for each variable pair, highlighting potential correlations and patterns. This can be instrumental in detecting anomalies, understanding feature interactions, and driving exploratory data analysis. **Limitations**: This metric's limitations are inherent in its simplicity. The use of histograms might not be effective in identifying complex patterns or detailed intricacies in the data. There could also be an issue of overplotting with larger datasets. Additionally, this test only works with categorical data and may not provide useful insights for numerical or continuous variables. Also, the interpretation of the visual results depends a lot on the expertise of the observer.\nvalidmind.data_validation.BivariateHistograms\n\n\nMetric\nWOE Bin Table\n**Purpose**: The Weight of Evidence (WoE) and Information Value (IV) test is intended to evaluate the predictive power of each feature in the machine learning model. The test generates binned groups of values from each feature in a dataset, computes the WoE value and the IV value for each bin. These values provide insights on the relationship between each feature and the target variable and their contribution towards the predictive output of the model. **Test Mechanism**: The metric leverages the `scorecardpy.woebin` method to perform WoE based automatic binning on the dataset. Depending on the parameter `breaks_adj`, the method adjusts the cut-off points for binning numeric variables. The bins are then used to calculate the WoE and IV. The metric requires a dataset with the target variable defined. The metric outputs a dataframe that comprises the bin boundaries, WoE, and IV values for each feature. **Signs of High Risk**: Indicators of high risk associated with this metric might include high IV values, which denote variables with too much predictive power which might lead to overfitting. Another sign of risk could be errors during the binning process, which might be due to inappropriate data types or poorly defined bins. **Strengths**: The WoE and IV test is highly effective for feature selection in binary classification problems, as it quantifies how much predictive information is packed within each feature regarding the binary outcome. Furthermore, the WoE transformation creates a monotonic relationship between the target and independent variables. **Limitations**: This method is mainly designed for binary classification tasks, therefore it might not be applicable or reliable for multi-class classification or regression tasks. Additionally, if the dataset has many features or the features are not binnable or they are non-numeric, this process might encounter difficulties. Furthermore, this metric doesn't help in identifying if the predictive factor being observed is a coincidence or a real phenomenon due to data randomness.\nvalidmind.data_validation.WOEBinTable\n\n\nMetric\nHeatmap Feature Correlations\n**Purpose:** The HeatmapFeatureCorrelations metric is utilized to evaluate the degree of interrelationships between pairs of input features within a dataset. This metric allows us to visually comprehend the correlation patterns through a heatmap, which can be essential in understanding which features may contribute most significantly to the performance of the model. Features that have high intercorrelation can potentially reduce the model's ability to learn, thus impacting the overall performance and stability of the machine learning model. **Test Mechanism:** The metric executes the correlation test by computing the Pearson correlations for all pairs of numerical features. It then generates a heatmap plot using seaborn, a Python data visualization library. The colormap ranges from -1 to 1, indicating perfect negative correlation and perfect positive correlation respectively. A 'declutter' option is provided which, if set to true, removes variable names and numerical correlations from the plot to provide a more streamlined view. The size of feature names and correlation coefficients can be controlled through 'fontsize' parameters. **Signs of High Risk:** Indicators of potential risk include features with high absolute correlation values. Since this suggests a significant degree of multicollinearity, it might lead to instabilities in the trained model and can also result in overfitting. Furthermore, the presence of multiple homogeneous blocks of high positive or negative correlation within the plot might indicate redundant or irrelevant features included within the dataset. **Strengths:** The strength of this metric lies in its ability to visually represent the extent and direction of correlation between any two numeric features, which aids in the interpretation and understanding of complex data relationships. The heatmap provides an immediate and intuitively understandable representation, hence, it is extremely useful for high-dimensional datasets where extracting meaningful relationships might be challenging. **Limitations:** The central limitation might be that it can only calculate correlation between numeric features, making it unsuitable for categorical variables unless they are already numerically encoded in a meaningful manner. Also, it uses Pearson's correlation, which only measures linear relationships between features. It may perform poorly in cases where the relationship is non-linear. Moreover, large feature sets might result in cluttered and difficult-to-read correlation heatmaps, especially when the 'declutter' option is set to false.\nvalidmind.data_validation.HeatmapFeatureCorrelations\n\n\nThresholdTest\nTime Series Frequency\n**Purpose**: The TimeSeriesFrequency test is designed to evaluate the consistency in the frequency of data points in a time series dataset. The metric inspects the intervals or duration between each data point in the dataset and helps to determine if there is a fixed pattern (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly). This is important in time-series analysis, as irregularities in the data frequency can lead to erroneous results or may affect the model's ability to identify trends and patterns. **Test Mechanism**: The test examines the dataframe index to verify that it's in datetime format. Afterwards, it identifies the frequency of each data series in the dataframe by employing pandas' `infer_freq` method, which infers the frequency of a given time series. It returns the frequency string as well as a dictionary that matches frequency strings to their respective labels. The frequencies of all variables in the dataset are then compared. If they all share one common frequency, the test passes; otherwise, it fails. A frequency plot that graphically depicts the time differences between consecutive entries in the dataframe index is also generated using Plotly. **Signs of High Risk**: One significant sign of high risk is if the test fails, i.e., when there are multiple unique frequencies in the dataset. This could indicate irregular time intervals between observations, which could disrupt pattern recognition or trend analysis that the model is designed to conduct. Also, missing or null frequencies can signify data inconsistencies or gaps in the data collection process. **Strengths**: This test provides a systematic way to check and visually represent the consistency of data frequency in a time series dataset. It increases reliability of the model by asserting that the timing and consistency of the observations are in line with the requirements of time series analysis. The visual plot generated provides an intuitive representation of the dataset's frequency distribution, catering to visual learners and aiding explanation and interpretation. **Limitations**: This test is restricted to time-series datasets; hence, it is not applicable to all kinds of datasets. Moreover, the `infer_freq` method may not always infer the correct frequency in the presence of missing or irregular data points. Lastly, in some cases, mixed frequencies might be acceptable depending on the context or the model being developed, but this test considers them a failing condition.\nvalidmind.data_validation.TimeSeriesFrequency\n\n\nMetric\nDataset Split\n**Purpose:** The DatasetSplit test is designed to evaluate and visualize the distribution of data among training, testing, and validation datasets, if available, within a given machine learning model. The main purpose is to assess whether the model's datasets are split appropriately, as an imbalanced split might affect the model's ability to learn from the data and generalize to unseen data. **Test Mechanism:** The DatasetSplit test first calculates the total size of all available datasets in the model. Then, for each individual dataset, the methodology involves determining the size of the dataset and its proportion relative to the total size. The results are then conveniently summarized in a table that shows dataset names, sizes, and proportions. Absolute size and proportion of the total dataset size are displayed for each individual dataset. **Signs of High Risk:** High risk signals include: 1. A very small training dataset, which may result in the model not learning enough from the data. 2. A very large training dataset and a small test dataset, which may lead to model overfitting and poor generalization to unseen data. 3. A small or non-existent validation dataset, which might complicate the model's performance assessment. **Strengths:** 1. The DatasetSplit test provides a clear, understandable visualization of dataset split proportions, which can highlight any potential imbalance in dataset splits quickly. 2. It covers a wide range of task types including classification, regression, and text-related tasks. 3. The metric is not tied to any specific data type and is applicable to tabular data, time series data, or text data. **Limitations:** 1. The DatasetSplit test does not provide any insight into the quality or diversity of the data within each split, just the size and proportion. 2. The test does not give any recommendations or adjustments for imbalanced datasets. 3. Potential lack of compatibility with more complex modes of data splitting (for example, stratified or time-based splits) could limit the applicability of this test.\nvalidmind.data_validation.DatasetSplit\n\n\nMetric\nSpread Plot\n**Purpose**: The purpose of the SpreadPlot metric is to visually explore and understand the relationships between pairs of time series variables in the given dataset. This understanding aids in identifying and assessing potential time series relationships, such as cointegration, between variables. **Test Mechanism**: The test mechanism for this metric involves calculating and plotting the spread between each pair of time series variables in the dataset. More specifically, the difference between two variables is computed and then plotted as a line graph. This process is repeated for all unique pairs of variables in the dataset. **Signs of High Risk**: Signs of high risk related to this metric include the presence of large fluctuations in the spread over time, unexpected patterns, or trends that might signal a potential risk in the underlying relationships between the variables. Also, the presence of significant missing data or extreme outlier values could potentially distort the spread, indicating a high risk. **Strengths**: The key strengths of using the SpreadPlot metric include: 1. Enables detailed visual inspection and interpretation of the relationships between time-series pairs. 2. Facilitates uncovering complex relationships like cointegration. 3. Enhances interpretability by visualizing the relationships, aiding in identifying outliers and trends. 4. Capable of handling multiple variable pairs from a dataset with a flexible and adaptable process. **Limitations**: Despite its strengths, the SpreadPlot metric also comes with certain limitations: 1. It's primarily a visualization tool and does not provide quantitative measurements or statistics to objectively assess relationships. 2. Highly dependent on the quality and granularity of the data – missing data or outliers can significantly affect the interpretation of the relationships. 3. Can become inefficient or challenging to interpret with a large number of variables due to the large number of plots. 4. Might not fully capture complex non-linear relationships between variables.\nvalidmind.data_validation.SpreadPlot\n\n\nMetric\nTime Series Line Plot\n**1. Purpose**: The \"TimeSeriesLinePlot\" metric is designed to generate and analyze time series data visual plots for model performance inspection purposes. This analysis manifests as line plots that represent various time series in the dataset. By visual plotting, the metric helps in the initial data inspection, which gives a sense of patterns, trends, seasonality, irregularity, and any anomalies that might occur over time in the given dataset. **2. Test Mechanism**: This Python class extracts the column names from the input dataset and iteratively generates line plots for each column. The Python library 'Plotly' is used for creating the line plots. For every column (representing a time series), a plot's time-series values are generated against the dataset's datetime index. Indexes that are not of datetime type will trigger a ValueError. **3. Signs of High Risk**: Red flags that could denote potential high risk scenarios include: * Time-series data lacking datetime indices * Non-existence of provided columns in the dataset * Anomalous patterns or irregularities seen in time-series plots indicating high model instability or predictive error potential **4. Strengths**: This metric comes with several favourable assets: * It succinctly visualizes complex time series data, facilitating easier interpretation and detection of temporal trends, patterns and anomalies. * It is highly adaptable and capable of functioning well with multiple time series within the same dataset. * By visual inspection, it allows the detection of anomalies and irregular patterns that could indicate a potential issue with the data or model performance. **5. Limitations**: Despite its numerous advantages, the metric has a few limitations: * The effectiveness of this metric relies heavily on the quality and patterns of the input time series data. * It's solely a visual inspection tool and does not provide quantitative measurement. This can be a disadvantage when the aim is to compare and rank multiple models or when precise, numeric diagnostics are required. * It assumes that the time specific data has already been transformed into a datetime index and requires the input data to be formatted appropriately. * It inherently lacks the ability to extract any deeper statistical insights from the time series data, making it less effective when dealing with complex data structures and phenomena.\nvalidmind.data_validation.TimeSeriesLinePlot\n\n\nMetric\nPi T Credit Scores Histogram\n**Purpose**: The PiT (Point in Time) Credit Scores Histogram metric is used to assess the performance of a classification model with a focus on credit risk evaluation. It visualizes the distributions of observed and predicted default scores and provides an intuitive comparison allowing for quick model assessment. **Test Mechanism**: This metric leverages histograms to illustrate the differences in score distributions for both observed and predicted results. It separates the scores into defaulted (1) and not defaulted (0) and makes a histogram for each of these categories. The model compares the distributions of observed and predicted classifications simultaneously, furnishing a clear idea about how well the model can predict the credit risk. **Signs of High Risk**: If the observed and predicted histograms are significantly different, there may be risk factors that the model is not adequately addressing. Additionally, if the predicted defaults are concentrated towards one end of the graph or are less evenly distributed than the observed scores, this could indicate potential issues with how the model is understanding the data or predicting outcomes. **Strengths**: This metric provides an intuitive visual representation of model performance which can be easily understood and interpreted even without extensive technical background. By comparing the distributions of observed and predicted scores, it gives a clear picture about the model's ability in distinguishing between defaulting and non-defaulting entities. It's especially tailored for credit risk assessment models and the PiT element takes into consideration time evolution of credit risk. **Limitations**: This visual method may not provide accurate enough information for detailed statistical analysis and doesn't give precise, quantifiable measures of model performance. It relies on manual inspection and comparison, making it subjective to human bias and potentially less reliable for catching subtle discrepancies. Furthermore, this method doesn't work well when the score distributions overlap significantly or when there are too many scores to be plotted, resulting in cluttered or hard-to-read graphs.\nvalidmind.data_validation.PiTCreditScoresHistogram\n\n\nMetric\nAuto Seasonality\n**Purpose:** The AutoSeasonality metric is intended to automatically detect and determine the optimal seasonal order or period for each variable in a time series dataset. The aim here is to quantify the inherent periodic pattern and seasonality that recurs after fixed intervals of time in the dataset. This is especially crucial for forecasting-based models, where understanding the seasonality component of the series can substantially enhance prediction accuracy. **Test Mechanism:** The implementation uses the seasonal decomposition method from Statsmodels Python library, broken down into 'additive' model type for each variable within the defined range of 'min_period' and 'max_period'. The test applies the seasonal decompose function to each seasonality period in the range and calculates the mean residual error for each period. The seasonal period that minimizes these residual errors is selected as the 'Best Period'. The results include the 'Best Period', along with the calculated residual errors and the determination of 'Seasonality' or 'No Seasonality'. **Signs of High Risk:** The following factors may indicate high risk or failure in the model's performance: - If the optimal seasonal period or 'Best Period' is consistently at the maximum or minimum limit of the provided range for a majority of variables, this might signify that the specified range doesn't adequately capture the true seasonality of the series. - A high average 'Residual Error' for the 'Best Period' could imply issues with the performance of the model. **Strengths:** This metric offers several advantages for time series dataset analysis: - It provides a robust, automated approach to identifying and quantifying the optimal seasonality. - It is applicable to multiple variables in a dataset, offering a comprehensive assessment of each variable's seasonality. - It uses concrete and measurable statistical methods to derive seasonality, enhancing the objectivity and reproducibility of the model. **Limitations:** There are also a few limitations of this metric: - Errors may arise if the time series exhibits random walk behaviour or lacks a clear seasonality, as the seasonal decomposition model may not be appropriate. - The defined range for the seasonal period (min_period and max_period) can influence the results. If the true seasonality period lies outside this range, this approach will not be able to identify the actual seasonality. - It may not fully interpret complex patterns that go beyond the simple additive model for seasonal decomposition. - The tool may infer seasonality where none exists if random fluctuations in the data match the defined seasonal period range.\nvalidmind.data_validation.AutoSeasonality\n\n\nMetric\nBivariate Scatter Plots\n**Purpose**: This metric is intended for visual inspection and monitoring of relationships between pairs of variables in a machine learning model targeting classification tasks. It is especially useful for understanding how predictor variables (features) behave in relation to each other and how they are distributed for different classes of the target variable, which could inform feature selection, model-building strategies, and even alert to possible biases and irregularities in the data. **Test Mechanism**: This metric operates by creating a scatter plot for each pair of the selected features in the dataset. If the parameters \"features_pairs\" are not specified, an error will be thrown. The metric offers flexibility by allowing the user to filter on a specific target class - specified by the \"target_filter\" parameter - for more granified insights. Each scatterplot is then color-coded based on the category of the target variable for better visual differentiation. The seaborn scatterplot library is used for generating the plots. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk indicators in this context would be related to visual patterns which might suggest non-linear relationships, substantial skewness, multicollinearity, clustering, or isolated outlier points in the scatter plot. Such issues could affect the assumptions and performance of some models, especially the ones assuming linearity like linear regression or logistic regression. **Strengths**: Scatterplots are simple and intuitive for users to understand, providing a visual tool to pinpoint complex relationships between two variables. It helps in outlier detection, identification of variable associations and trends, including non-linear patterns which can be overlooked by other linear-focused metrics or tests. The implementation also supports visualizing binary or multi-class classification datasets. **Limitations**: Scatterplots are limited to bivariate analysis - the relationship of two variables at a time - and might not reveal the full picture in higher dimensions or where interactions are present. They also are not ideal for very large datasets as points will overlap and render the visualization less informative. Further, scatterplots are more of an exploratory tool rather than a formal statistical test, so they don't provide any quantitative measure of model quality or performance. Interpretation of scatterplots relies heavily on the domain knowledge and judgment of the viewer, which can introduce subjective bias.\nvalidmind.data_validation.BivariateScatterPlots\n\n\nMetric\nEngle Granger Coint\n**Purpose**: The purpose of this metric is to use the Engle-Granger test to examine for cointegration between pairs of time series variables in a given dataset. This can be beneficial for assessing the extent to which two time series variables move together over time. Predictive regressions can be substantially more accurate if the variables involved are co-integrated. **Test Mechanism**: This test first prepares the input dataset by dropping any non-applicable values. It then iterates pairs of variables, applying the Engle-Granger cointegration test to each pair. The test yield a 'p' value, which is then compared to a pre-set threshold to determine whether the corresponding variables are cointegrated or not. If the 'p' value is less than or equal to the threshold, the decision is 'Cointegrated', if not, 'Not cointegrated'. The metric returns a summary table of the cointegration results for each pair of time series variables. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk can be indicated if a large number of variables that are expected to be cointegrated fail the test. Also, if a significant number of 'p' values obtained are near the threshold, it also poses a risk as minor data variations can skew the decision between 'Cointegrated' and 'Not cointegrated'. **Strengths**: This test is a powerful method for analysing the relationship between time series, particularly when it's important to know whether variables are moving together in a statistically significant manner. Objectively evaluating such relationships can drive better forecasting in many domains, especially in finance or economics where prediction models often depend on understanding how different variables move together over time. **Limitations**: Cointegration tests, such as the Engle-Granger, often assume that time series are integrated of the same order, which is not always true in multi-variate time series datasets. Non-stationary characteristics in the series or the presence of structural breaks might give falsely positive or negative cointegration results. Additionally, the method doesn't work very well with small sample sizes due to a lack of power. Thus, the test must be used with caution, and where possible, corroborated with other predictive indicators.\nvalidmind.data_validation.EngleGrangerCoint\n\n\nThresholdTest\nTime Series Missing Values\n**Purpose**: This test is designed to verify that the number of missing values in a historical time-series dataset is below a specified threshold. Since time-series models rely on continuity and temporality of data points, missing values could affect the model's performance. Therefore, this test intends to maintain data quality and readiness for the machine learning model. **Test Mechanism**: The test process begins by checking if the dataset has a datetime index; if not, an error is raised. Next, a lower limit threshold for missing values is set and a missing values check is run on each column of the dataset, with a test result object being generated whether the number of missing values is below the specified threshold. The percentage of missing values is also calculated alongside the raw count. As a visualization aid, the test generates two plots (a bar plot and a heatmap) to better illustrate the distribution and quantity of missing values per variable, if any exist. The test results, missing values count, missing values percentage, and the pass/fail status are returned in a results table. **Signs of High Risk**: If any column in the dataset contains a number of missing values exceeding the threshold, it is considered a failure and a high-risk scenario. This could be due to incomplete data collection, faulty sensors, or data preprocessing errors. A continuous visual 'streak' in the 'heatmap' might also indicate a systematic error during data collection. **Strengths**: This test is beneficial in promptly identifying missing values which might impact the model's performance. It is broadly applicable and customizable through the threshold parameter. Going beyond raw numbers to calculate the percentile of missing values adds a more relative understanding of data scarcity. It also includes a robust mechanism to visually represent data quality, facilitating quicker and friendlier misinterpretation. **Limitations**: Though the test effectively identifies missing values, it does not suggest methods to deal with them. It assumes that the dataset should have datetime index, limiting its use to time series analysis only. The test is sensitive to the 'min_threshold' parameter and might raise false alarms if it's set too strictly, or might miss problematic data if it's set too loosely. Lastly, the test solely focuses on 'missingness' and might overlook other aspects of data quality.\nvalidmind.data_validation.TimeSeriesMissingValues\n\n\nDatasetMetadata\nDataset Metadata\n**Purpose**: The main objective of the `DatasetMetadata` test is to gather and log crucial descriptive statistics about the datasets used during model training. It serves as an important tool for monitoring relevant characteristics of the dataset, such as task types (classification, regression, text_classification, text_summarization) and tags (tabular_data, time_series_data, text_data). This helps ensure that model validation exercises are conducted with full transparency and context by connecting different metrics and test results to the underlying dataset. **Test Mechanism**: This class does not include a specific test or grading scale. Instead, it collects metadata associated with the dataset and logs it for future reference. The metadata is attached to the dataset object during the post-initialization phase. The `run` method initializes a `TestSuiteDatasetResult` object with a unique result ID and dataset. The dataset metadata then gets associated with this ID for future use in more targeted validation efforts. **Signs of High Risk**: The risks associated with this process are not connected with model performance or biases. However, incomplete metadata, incorrect dataset labels, or missing dataset types could lead to inaccuracies in model risk assessment and may constitute signs of risk within the metadata gathering process itself. **Strengths**: A key strength of this class is the transparency it brings to model validation exercises by providing detailed information about the dataset. This can help in diagnosing errors, identifying correlations to the model's behavior, ensuring correct task and data-type associations, and enabling superior model explanations. Also, it can support dataset versioning by logging each dataset's metadata, offering a trackable history of changes. **Limitations**: The `DatasetMetadata` class could lack completeness or accuracy, particularly if metadata is not adequately added or is incorrect. The process does not inherently evaluate the quality of the dataset or directly validate the model's predictions, so it must be combined with other tests for a comprehensive evaluation. Lastly, any potential bias in the dataset won't be recognized using this class. Bias detection would require separate tests tailored specifically towards fairness and bias detection.\nvalidmind.data_validation.DatasetMetadata\n\n\nMetric\nTime Series Histogram\n**Purpose**: This test conducts a histogram analysis on time series data. The goal is to evaluate the distribution of values in the dataset over a given time period, typically for regression tasks. Internet traffic, stock prices, weather data etc. could be time series data. Histograms provide insights into the data’s underlying probability distribution, skewness, peakness(kurtosis) etc. **Test Mechanism**: The test requires a dataset column that must have a datetime type index. It iterates over each column in the provided dataset and generates a histogram using Seaborn's histplot function. If the dataset contains more than one time-series (i.e., more than one column with datetime type index), a separate histogram will be plotted for each. Additionally, a kernel density estimate (KDE) line is drawn for each histogram to indicate the data's underlying probability distribution. The x and y-axis labels are hidden to only focus on the data distribution. **Signs of High Risk**: - The dataset does not contain a column with a datetime type index. - The specified columns do not exist in the dataset. - The distribution of data in the histogram exhibits high skewness or kurtosis, which might induce biases in the model. - Presence of outliers that are far from the main data distribution. **Strengths**: - Provides a visual diagnostic tool, which is a good starting point to understand the overall behavior and distribution trends of the dataset. - Works well for both single and multiple time series data analysis. - The Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) line offers a smooth estimate of the overall trend in data distribution. **Limitations**: - It only provides a high-level overview of data distribution and does not provide specific numeric measures of skewness, kurtosis, etc. - It doesn’t show the precise data values and the actual data is grouped into bins, hence some detail is inherently lost (precision vs. general overview trade-off). - Can't handle non-numeric data columns. - The shape of the histogram can be sensitive to the number of bins used.\nvalidmind.data_validation.TimeSeriesHistogram\n\n\nMetric\nLagged Correlation Heatmap\n**Purpose**: This LaggedCorrelationHeatmap metric is designed to evaluate and visualize the correlation between the target variable and certain delayed copies (lags) of independent variables in a time-series based dataset. This metric aids in uncovering relationships in time-series data where the influence of an input feature on the target variable may not be immediate but occurs after a certain period (lags). **Test Mechanism**: Python's Pandas library is used in conjunction with Plotly to perform computations and generate the heatmap. The target variable and corresponding independent variables are taken from the dataset. Subsequently, lags of independent variables are generated and the correlation between these lagged variables and the target are calculated. The calculated correlations are stored in a matrix that has variables on one axis and the number of lags on the other. This correlation matrix is then visualized as a heatmap, where different color intensities represent the strength of the correlation, making patterns easier to spot. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk associated with this metric may be indicated by insignificant correlations throughout the heatmap or by correlations that break intuition or prior knowledge, indicating potential issues with the data or model. **Strengths**: This metric offers an excellent way to explore and visualize the time-dependent relationships between features and the target variable in a time-series dataset. By looking at correlations with lagged features, it is possible to identify delayed effects that may go unnoticed with more traditional correlation measures. As it's visually represented, the heatmaps are a very intuitive way to present time dependent correlations and influence. **Limitations**: The LaggedCorrelationHeatmap metric has a few limitations. It assumes linear relationships between the variables, meaning relationships that aren't linear may go undetected. As it only considers linear correlation, it may miss out on complex nonlinear interactions. This metric works only with time-series data and would not be applicable for other types of data. Also, the choice of number of lags used can also affect the results; whilst too many lags can make the heatmap hard to interpret and less useful, too few might miss delayed effects. Furthermore, this metric does not consider any causal relationship, it merely presents the correlation.\nvalidmind.data_validation.LaggedCorrelationHeatmap\n\n\nMetric\nSeasonal Decompose\n**Purpose**: This test utilizes the Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series by Loess (STL) method to break down a dataset into its fundamental components: observed, trend, seasonal, and residuals. The main purpose of this method is to identify any hidden or non-intuitive patterns and ascertain certain attributes such as seasonality in the dataset's features, helping to understand and validate the dataset further. **Test Mechanism**: The test uses the seasonal_decompose function from the statsmodels.tsa.seasonal library to assess each feature in the dataset. The seasonal_decompose function breaks down each analyzed feature into four components: observed, trend, seasonal, and residuals. It generates graphical representations, essentially six subplot graphs for each feature, to visually interpret the results. The Seasonal Decompose test also includes a verification step to identify and exclude non-finite values before the seasonal decomposition. **Signs of High Risk**: Signs of high risk associated with this test include: - Non-finiteness: Having too many non-finite values in a dataset might imply a high risk since these values are excluded before performing the seasonal decomposition. - Frequent Warnings: Issue warnings when the test fails to infer frequency for a contested feature. - High Seasonality: If the seasonal component is significantly high, forecasts might be highly unreliable due to excessive seasonal changes. **Strengths**: Strengths of this metric test include: - Ability to Detect Seasonality: This code excels in detecting hidden seasonality patterns within features of datasets. - Visualization: This test provides visualizations, making it easier to interpret and comprehend. - Works with Any Regression Model: It does not restrict its applicability to any specific regression model, ensuring wider usability. **Limitations**: Limitations of this method include: - Dependencies on Assumptions: The test assumes that features in the dataset have a certain frequency. If no frequency could be inferred for a variable, that feature will be excluded from analysis. - Handling of Non-finite Values: The test excludes non-finite values during the analysis which could lead to incomplete representation or understanding of the dataset. - Not Reliable for Noisy Datasets: This test may generate unreliable results in the presence of heavy noise.\nvalidmind.data_validation.SeasonalDecompose\n\n\nMetric\nWOE Bin Plots\n**Purpose**: The purpose of this test is to perform a visual analysis of the Weight of Evidence (WoE) and Information Value (IV) for categorical variables in a provided dataset. This aids in understanding the predictive power of each variable in a classification-based machine learning model by displaying the data distribution over the different categories of each feature. WoE and IV are common metric in credit scoring models and provide reliable statistical measures for variables' predictive power. **Test Mechanism**: The test mechanism proceeds in predefined steps. It first selects non-numeric columns and converts them to string type for proper binning. Afterward, it performs an automatic WoE binning on the selected features in the dataset, which effectively groups the possible values of a variable into bins or categories. Once this is done, the function generates two visual charts for each variable - a Bar chart for IV and a Scatter chart for WoE values. These visualizations are rendered based on the distribution of the respective metric across the different categories of each feature. **Signs of High Risk**: Indicators of high potential risk include an error occurring during the binning process or issues converting non-numeric columns to string data type. Furthermore, an uneven distribution of WoE and IV, especially if certain bins dominate others significantly, might indicate that the model is excessively relying on certain variables or categories for predictions, which could have an adverse impact on the model's generalizability and robustness. **Strengths**: One of the strengths of using this metric is that it provides a detailed visual presentation of how feature categories relate to the target variable, giving an intuitive understanding of the feature's contribution to the model. It also allows easy identification of highly impacting features, which can aid in feature selection and in understanding the decision logic of the model. Furthermore, WoE transformations are monotonic, meaning they preserve the rank ordering of the original data points, which simplifies subsequent analyses. **Limitations**: One of the limitations of this method is that it is largely dependent on the binning process. An inappropriate choice of the number of bins or the binning thresholds can lead to an inadequate representation of the variable's distribution. Also, this method is most suitable for categorical data; encoding continuous variables to categorical might sometimes lead to loss of information. Another limitation is that extreme or outlier values can have a significant impact on WoE and IV calculation. Finally, it requires sufficient events per bin in order to give reliable information value and weight of evidence.\nvalidmind.data_validation.WOEBinPlots\n\n\nThresholdTest\nClass Imbalance\n**Purpose**: The purpose of the ClassImbalance test is to assess the distribution of the target classes in a dataset used for a machine learning model. Particularly, this method is geared towards ensuring that the classes are not too skewed, which could bias the predictions of the model. It is important to have a balanced dataset for training to avoid biased model with high accuracy for the majority class and low accuracy for the minority class. **Test Mechanism**: The ClassImbalance test functions by determining the frequency (in percentage proportion) of each class in the target column of the dataset and checks whether each class appears in at least a particular minimum percentage of the total records. This minimum percentage is a parameter that can be pre-set or changed according to requirements; the default value in this case is set to 10%. **Signs of High Risk**: Any class that constitutes less than the preset minimum percentage threshold is flagged as a high risk, indicating potential class imbalance. The function provides a pass/fail verdict for each class based on this criterion. In essence, if any class fails this test, the dataset is likely to contain an imbalanced class distribution. **Strengths**: 1. Identifies under-represented classes which can impact the performance of a machine learning model. 2. Easy and fast to compute. 3. The test is very informative as it not only detects imbalance but also quantifies the degree of imbalance. 4. Adjustable threshold allows flexibility and adaptation to varying use-cases or domain-specific requirements. 5. The test generates a visually intuitive plot showing classes and their corresponding proportions, aiding in interpretability and understanding of the data. **Limitations**: 1. The test might not perform well, or offer useful insights for datasets with too many classes. The imbalance may be inevitable due to the inherent class distribution. 2. Sensitivity to the threshold value may lead to false discrimination of imbalance when the threshold is set too high. 3. Irrespective of the percentage threshold, it does not account for different costs or impacts of misclassification of different classes, which can vary based on specific application or domain. 4. While it can identify imbalances in class distribution, it does not offer direct ways to handle or correct such imbalances. 5. The test is only applicable for classification tasks and not for regression or clustering tasks.\nvalidmind.data_validation.ClassImbalance\n\n\nMetric\nIQR Outliers Bar Plot\n**Purpose**: The InterQuartile Range Outliers Bar Plot (IQROutliersBarPlot) metric aims to visually analyse and evaluate the extent of outliers in numeric variables based on percentiles. This metric is vital for understanding data distribution, identifying abnormalities within a dataset and assessing the risk associated with processing potentially skewed data that might impact the predictive performance of the machine learning model. **Test Mechanism**: The test involves the following steps: 1. For each numeric feature, or column, in the dataset, it computes Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile), and then the Interquartile Range (IQR) which is the difference between Q3 and Q1. 2. It then calculates the thresholds for lower and upper bounds as Q1 minus `threshold` times IQR and Q3 plus `threshold` times IQR, respectively. The default `threshold` is 1.5. 3. Any value in the feature that is less than the lower bound and greater than the upper bound is considered an outlier. 4. The number of outliers are then calculated for different percentile categories like [0-25], [25-50], [50-75], [75-100]. 5. These counts are then used to prepare a bar plot for the feature showing the distribution of outliers across different percentile ranges. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or failure in the model's performance could be indicated by: 1. Presence of large number of outliers in the data that will skew the distribution. 2. When the outliers are in higher percentiles (75-100). This indicates extreme values, which can have a more prominent impact on the model's performance. 3. Certain features having a majority of their values as outliers, meaning these features may not contribute positively to model's prediction power. **Strengths**: 1. Identifies outliers in the data visually, which is easy to understand and can help in interpreting the potential impact on the model. 2. Accommodates both total numeric features or a selected subset hence proving its flexibility. 3. Agnostic to the task type: can be used for both classification and regression tasks. 4. This metric can process large datasets as it does not rely on computationally expensive operations. **Limitations**: 1. This metric only works with numerical variables and would not be applicable to categorical variables. 2. It uses a pre-defined threshold (defaulting to 1.5) to determine what constitutes an outlier. This threshold might not be ideal for all cases. 3. This metric does not provide insights about the consequence of these outliers on the predictive performance of the models, but only presents their presence and distribution. 4. It assumes that the data is unimodal and symmetric, which may not be always the case. For non-normal distributions, the results might be misleading.\nvalidmind.data_validation.IQROutliersBarPlot\n\n\nMetric\nPi TPD Histogram\n**Purpose**: The PiTPDHistogram metric is used to compute the Probability of Default (PD) for each instance in both the training and test datasets in order to evaluate the model's performance in credit risk estimation. The PD is examined at a specific point in time (PiT). The resulting distributions for the actual and predicted default classes are then visualized in a histogram, making it easier to understand the model's prediction accuracy. **Test Mechanism**: This metric sorts instances into either observed (actual) or predicted default classes, with a default being represented by '1' and non-default as '0'. Using these classes, the probability of default is computed for each instance and plotted in a histogram. Two histograms are generated: one for the observed defaults and another one for the predicted defaults. If the distribution of predicted defaults closely matches the distribution of observed defaults, this would indicate good model performance. **Signs of High Risk**: Discrepancies between the two histograms (observed and predicted defaults) would suggest model risk. This may include differences in the shapes of the histograms, divergences in the spread of default probabilities, or significant mismatches in the peak default probabilities. These disparities signal that the model may not be accurately predicting defaults, which could pose a high risk especially in the field of credit risk analysis. **Strengths**: This metric excels in its visual interpretation of model performance. By comparing two histograms side by side, it allows for a convenient comparison between the observed and predicted defaults. This visualization can reveal model biases and illuminate areas where the model's performance may fall short, which might not be as evident in purely numerical evaluations or more complex visualization measures. **Limitations**: Despite its strengths, the PiTPDHistogram metric is largely interpretive and subjective. Determining risk based on visual discrepancies requires a certain level of human judgement and may vary between different analysts. If used solely, this metric might overlook other nuances in model performance that are better captured by more quantitative or diversified metrics. Furthermore, the information provided is limited to a specific point in time, which might not fully reflect the model's performance over different periods or under changing conditions.\nvalidmind.data_validation.PiTPDHistogram\n\n\nMetric\nAuto AR\n**Purpose**: The purpose of this test, referred to as AutoAR, is to automatically detect the Autoregressive (AR) order of a time series using both Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and Akaike information criterion (AIC) for regression tasks. The AR order specifies the number of previous terms in the series to use to predict the current term. The goal is to select the appropriate AR model that best captures the trend and seasonality in the time series data. **Test Mechanism**: The test iterates over a range of possible AR orders up to a specified maximum. For each order, an autoregressive model is fitted, and the BIC and AIC are computed. Both these statistical measures penalize models for complexity (higher number of parameters), favoring simpler models that fit the data well. Additionally, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test is conducted to check stationarity of the time series; non-stationary series might produce inaccurate results. The test results, including AR order, BIC, and AIC, are added into a dataframe for easy comparison. Subsequently, the AR order with minimum BIC is determined as the \"best\" order for each variable. **Signs of High Risk**: - If a time series is not stationary (Augmented Dickey-Fuller test p-value &gt; 0.05), it may lead to inaccurate results. - Issues with the model fitting process, such as computational or convergence problems, suggest a high risk. - If the chosen AR order is consistently at the maximum specified order, this could suggest insufficiency of the maximum set limit. **Strengths**: - The test automatically determines the optimal AR order, reducing potential bias involved in manual selection. - The method attempts to balance goodness-of-fit against model simplicity, preventing overfitting. - It factors in stationarity of the time series, essential for reliable AR modeling. - The test consolidates the results into a clear, easily interpreted table. **Limitations**: - The test requires stationary input time series. - Assumes linear relationship between the series and its lags. - Finding the best model is limited to the maximum AR order provided in the parameters. A low max_ar_order may yield suboptimal results. - AIC and BIC may not always select the same model as the best; interpretation may need to consider the goal and the trade-offs.\nvalidmind.data_validation.AutoAR\n\n\nMetric\nTabular Date Time Histograms\n**Purpose**: The purpose of `TabularDateTimeHistograms` metric is to visually analyze the datetime data within a given machine learning model dataset. It plots histograms for differences between consecutive dates across all datetime variables present in the dataset. This assists in the inspection and understanding of the frequency distribution of time intervals in the dataset, which can be useful in analysing patterns in the data over time. **Test Mechanism**: The test works by first extracting all the datetime columns from the dataset. For each of these datetime columns, the test then calculates the difference between consecutive dates and converts these differences into days. Zero values are filtered out to only plot data points that represent some amount of day difference. Histograms are created for each column using seaborn's histplot function and displayed with relevant labels. The histograms provide a visual representation of the frequency of occurrences of different day intervals in the dataset. **Signs of High Risk**: One high risk associated with this test is if no datetime columns are found in the data set, it would result in a ValueError. A potential sign of risk could also be a skewed or highly irregular distribution in the histogram, indicating potential issues in the data such as incorrect timestamps or anomalies. **Strengths**: The strengths of this metric include its ability to visually represent frequency distributions of time interval changes in the dataset, aiding in understanding inherent patterns. The histogram plots can also assist in identifying potential outliers and anomalies in the data, and can help assess data quality. The metric is applicable to various task types like classification, regression, and works with multiple datetime variables if available. **Limitations**: Limitations of using this metric mainly stem from its reliance on visual interpretation of the data. The metric does not provide a quantitative evaluation of the model and may not capture complexities or multidimensional patterns in data. The test can only be applied to datasets with datetime columns, and would fail in absence of them. Interpretation of the generated histograms also depends on the domain knowledge and experience of the investigator.\nvalidmind.data_validation.TabularDateTimeHistograms\n\n\nMetric\nPunctuations\n**1. Purpose:** The main goal of the Punctuations Metric is to analyze the frequency of punctuation usage within a given text dataset. This heuristic is often used in Natural Language Processing tasks such as text classification and text summarization. **2. Test Mechanism:** The test begins by checking the input's eligibility, specifying that the \"dataset\" must be of a VMDataset type. The next step is to create a corpus of the dataset by splitting the text of the input dataset on spaces. Then, it tallies the usage of each unique punctuation character in the text corpus. The distribution of the frequencies of each punctuation symbol is subsequently depicted as a bar graph. Results are stored as Figures and associated with the main Punctuations object. **3. Signs of High Risk:** Given the nature of the test, risks are typically associated with the quality of text data. One sign of high risk might be an excessive or unusual frequency of certain punctuation marks, which may denote dubious quality, data corruption, or skewed data. **4. Strengths:** The primary strength of this metric is providing insights into the distribution of punctuation use in a text dataset. This could be valuable in validating the quality, consistency, and nature of data. It could also offer hints about the style or tonality of the text corpus (e.g., frequent exclamation use might signify a more informal, emotional context). **5. Limitations:** This test exclusively looks at punctuation usage and thus can overlook other crucial text characteristics. Additionally, it’s crucial not to make broad cultural or tonality assumptions based solely on punctuation distribution since these may vary widely across different languages and contexts. It may also be less effective when dealing with languages that employ non-standard or different punctuation. Finally, the visualized results may lack interpretability when there are many unique punctuation marks in the dataset.\nvalidmind.data_validation.nlp.Punctuations\n\n\nMetric\nCommon Words\n**Purpose**: The CommonWords metric is used to identify and visualize the most prevalent words within a specified text column of a dataset, giving insights into the prevalent language patterns and vocabulary. This is particularly useful for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as text classification and text summarization. **Test Mechanism**: The methodology for this test involves splitting the specified text column's entries into words and collating them into a corpus. Subsequently, the frequency of each word is counted using Counter functionality. The forty most commonly occurring words that aren't categorized as English stopwords are then visualized in a bar chart. The x-axis shows formulated words and the y-axis indicates their frequency of appearance. **Signs of High Risk**: Indicators of high risk may include a lack of distinct words within the list, or common words primarily encompassing stopwords. In addition, the frequent appearance of irrelevant or inappropriate words could indicate a poorly curated or noisy data set. Lastly, if the test returns an error due to the absence of a valid Dataset object, it signifies a high risk as it can't be effectively implemented. **Strengths**: This metric offers a clear insight into the language features – specifically, the word frequency – of unstructured text data. It can reveal prominent vocabulary and language patterns, which can be vital for effective feature extraction in NLP tasks. The visualization aspect aids in quickly capturing the patterns and getting an intuitive feel of the data. **Limitations**: This test is solely focused on word frequency and disregards semantic or context-related information. It deliberately ignores stopwords, which, in some cases, might carry important significance. Furthermore, it may only be applicable to English language text data as it uses English stopwords for filtering, and does not account for data in other languages. The metric also requires a valid Dataset object, indicating a dependency condition that limits applicability.\nvalidmind.data_validation.nlp.CommonWords\n\n\nThresholdTest\nHashtags\n**Purpose**: The Hashtags test is designed to measure the frequency of hashtags used within a given text column in a dataset. It is particularly useful for natural language processing tasks such as text classification and text summarization. The goal is to identify common trends and patterns in the use of hashtags, which can serve as critical indicators or features within a machine learning model. **Test Mechanism**: The test implements a regular expression (regex) to extract all hashtags from the specified text column. For each hashtag found, it makes a tally of its occurrences. It then outputs a list of the top N hashtags (default is 25, but customizable), sorted by their counts in a descending order. The results are also visualized in a bar-plot that indicates frequency counts on the y-axis and the corresponding hashtags on the x-axis. **Signs of High Risk**: The indications of a potential high-risk situation may include: - A low diversity in the usage of hashtags as indicated by a few hashtags being used disproportionately more than the others. - Repeated usage of one or few hashtags can be indicative of spam or biased dataset. - If there are no or extremely few hashtags found in the dataset, it perhaps signifies that the text data does not contain structured social media data. **Strengths**: The Hashtags test has several strong points: - It provides a concise visual representation of the frequency of hashtags, which can be critical for understanding the trend about a particular topic in text data. - It is instrumental in tasks specifically related to social media text analytics such as opinion analysis, trend discovery, etc. - The test is adaptable, allowing the flexibility to determine the number of top hashtags to be analyzed. **Limitations**: Despite its strengths, the test has some limitations: - The test assumes the presence of hashtags and therefore may not be applicable for text datasets that do not contain hashtags (e.g., formal documents, scientific literature). - Language-specific limitations of hashtag formulations are not explicitly addressed. - It does not account for typographical errors, variations or synonyms in hashtags. - This test does not provide context or sentiment associated with the hashtags. Thus the information provided may have limited utility on its own.\nvalidmind.data_validation.nlp.Hashtags\n\n\nThresholdTest\nMentions\n**Purpose**: The \"Mentions\" test focuses on the aspect of data quality in an NLP (Natural Language Processing) or text-based Machine Learning model. Its main objective is to identify and analyze the frequency of 'mentions' within a given dataset, particularly within a selected text column. 'Mentions' in this context are discrete elements of text that are preceded by '@'. The output would reveal the most frequently mentioned entities or usernames, which could be crucial to certain applications like social media analyses, customer sentiment analyses, etc. **Test Mechanism**: Upon validating the presence of a text column in the provided dataset, this test applies a regular expression pattern to extract these mentions. The number of occurrences for each unique mention is then counted. The top mentions, based on user-specified parameters or by default the top 25, are selected for representation. This thresholding process forms the main mechanism of this test, showcasing high-frequency elements. The results are visually rendered in a treemap plot, wherein each rectangle's size is indicative of the corresponding mention's frequency. **Signs of High Risk**: Execution failure for this test could be linked to the absence of a valid text column in the dataset. One other indicators of high risk includes the absence of mentions in the text data, meaning that there might not be any text preceded by '@'. This conditions could indicate sparse or poor-quality data, affecting the model's ability to generalize or learn appropriately. **Strengths**: This test is specifically optimized for textual datasets, making it particularly powerful in NLP contexts. It allows rapid identification of dominant elements, displaying them visually for easy interpretation. This allows potentially pivotal insights about the most mentioned entities or usernames to be extracted. **Limitations**: This test can be limited by its dependence on '@' for the identification of mentions. Aspects of text not preceded by '@' could be potentially useful, but remain overlooked by this test. Additionally, this test is not suitable for datasets without textual data. The test doesn't present insights on less frequently occurring data or outliers, potentially leaving important patterns unrevealed.\nvalidmind.data_validation.nlp.Mentions\n\n\nMetric\nText Description\n**Purpose**: This is an in-depth textual analysis test used to assess the lexical complexity, structure, and vocabulary of a given dataset. The TextDescription metric measures various parameters such as: - **Total Words**: Assess the length and complexity of the input text. Longer documents might require more sophisticated summarization techniques, while shorter ones may need more concise summaries. - **Total Sentences**: Understand the structural makeup of the content. Longer texts with numerous sentences might require the model to generate longer summaries to capture essential information. - **Avg Sentence Length**: Determine the average length of sentences in the text. This can help the model decide on the appropriate length for generated summaries, ensuring they are coherent and readable. - **Total Paragraphs**: Analyze how the content is organized into paragraphs. The model should be able to maintain the logical structure of the content when producing summaries. - **Total Unique Words**: Measure the diversity of vocabulary in the text. A higher count of unique words could indicate more complex content, which the model needs to capture accurately. - **Most Common Words**: Identify frequently occurring words that likely represent key themes. The model should pay special attention to including these words and concepts in its summaries. - **Total Punctuations**: Evaluate the usage of punctuation marks, which contribute to the tone and structure of the content. The model should be able to maintain appropriate punctuation in summaries. - **Lexical Diversity**: Calculate the richness of vocabulary in relation to the overall text length. A higher lexical diversity suggests a broader range of ideas and concepts that the model needs to capture in its summaries. It is also responsible for paring down unwanted tokens, measuring the average sentence length, and calculating the lexical diversity in the available text. This metric's measures help in understanding the nature of the text and assessing the potential challenges of machine learning algorithms deployed for textual analysis, language processing, or summarization. **Test Mechanism**: The test operates by parsing the dataset and using the NLTK library to tokenize the text into words, sentences, and paragraphs. It dissects the processed text further, removing stopwords declared in 'unwanted_tokens' and punctuations. It then calculates parameters such as the total number of words, sentences, paragraphs, punctuations; average sentence length; and lexical diversity. The metric also condenses these results and plots scatter plots for certain combinations of variables (Total Words vs Total Sentences, Total Words vs Total Unique Words, etc.) to provide a visual depiction of the text structure. **Signs of High Risk**: Anomaly in results or increased complexity in lexical diversity, long sentences and paragraphs, high uniqueness of words, or an excess of unwanted tokens can signify risk in text processing ML models. It suggests that the model's text absorption and processing capability can be compromised. Additionally, missing or erroneous visualizations may also indicate issues with the text description analysis. **Strengths**: This metric is an essential tool for ML model data pre-processing, focusing on textual analysis. It provides a detailed dissection of a text dataset to understand structural and vocabulary complexity, which is helpful to strategize a ML model's textual processing capability. Besides, it visualizes correlations between chosen variables, helping further in grasping the text's structure and complexity. **Limitations**: This metric relies heavily on the NLTK library, rendering it unsuitable for languages unsupported by NLTK. The unwanted tokens and stop words are predefined, limiting customization by context or application. This metric does not consider semantics or grammatical complexities, which can be crucial in language processing. Finally, it assumes that the document is well-structured (with sentences and paragraphs); unstructured or poorly formatted text may skew the results.\nvalidmind.data_validation.nlp.TextDescription\n\n\nThresholdTest\nStop Words\n**Purpose**: The StopWords test is a data quality assessment tool specifically designed for text data. It identifies and analyzes the usage of 'stop words' within a dataset. Stop words are frequent, common words in a language (e.g., \"the\", \"and\", \"is\"), which are typically considered insignificant for in-depth analysis. The test quantifies the frequency of each stop word in the dataset, further calculating their proportional usage compared to the total word count. Ultimately, it aims to highlight the prevailing stop words based on their usage frequency. **Test Mechanism**: The test triggers once it receives a 'VMDataset' object; in absence of which, it raises an error. The text column of the dataset undergoes an inspection for the creation of a 'corpus' (a collection of written texts representing the dataset). With the help of Natural Language Toolkit's (NLTK) stop word repository, the test screens the corpus for any stop words and logs their frequency. Each stop word, expressed as a percentage usage out of the total corpus, is compared against a 'min_percent_threshold'. If the percentage exceeds this threshold, the test is deemed as failed. The test returns the top prevailing stop words, decided by the 'num_words' parameter, and their percentages. It also provides a bar chart visualization of the top stop words and their usage frequency for intuitive understanding. **Signs of High Risk**: Potential signs indicating high risk are if the percentage of any stop words exceeds the predefined 'min_percent_threshold' and the application's context where a major presence of stop words could negatively impact the analytical performance due to noise generation. **Strengths**: The main strengths of the StopWords test include its ability to scrutinize and quantify the usage of stop words in a dataset, which might often be overlooked due to their insignificant semantic meaning. The test gives insights into potential noise in the text data, which could interfere with model training efficiency. Furthermore, the bar chart visualization provided by the test facilitates readily interpretable and actionable insights. **Limitations**: While robust for stop word analysis, the test does exhibit a few limitations. It only works with English stop words and therefore may not perform well on datasets in other languages. The effectiveness of the test depends on the 'min_percent_threshold', which might need to be fine-tuned for different datasets. Additionally, the test does not consider the context of the stop words used within the dataset, and hence, it might overlook their significance if used in certain contexts. Lastly, the test checks only the frequency of stop words and does not offer direct measures of model performance or predictive accuracy.\nvalidmind.data_validation.nlp.StopWords"
