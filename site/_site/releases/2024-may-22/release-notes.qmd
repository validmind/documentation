### New introductory notebook for model developers

Our new end-to-end notebook gives you a full introduction to the ValidMind Developer Framework. As a model developer, you can use this notebook to learn how the end-to-end documentation process works, based on common scenarios you encounter in model development settings.

High level sections include:

1. **Initializing the ValidMind Developer Framework**

   ValidMind’s developer framework provides a rich collection of documentation tools and test suites, from documenting descriptions of datasets to validation and testing of models using a variety of open-source testing frameworks.

2. **Start the model development process with raw data, run out-of-the box tests, and add evidence to model documentation**

   Learn how to access ValidMind's test repository of individual tests that you will use as building blocks to ensure a model is being built appropriately. The goal is to show how to run tests, investigate results, and add tests results or evidence to the documentation.

   For a full list of out-of-the-box tests, see [Test descriptions](https://docs.validmind.com/guide/test-descriptions.html) or try the interactive [Test sandbox](https://docs.validmind.com/guide/test-sandbox.html).

3. **Implementing custom tests**

   Usually, model developers have their own custom tests and it is important to include this within the model documentation. We will show you how to include custom tests and then how they can be added to documentation as additional evidence.

4. **Finalize testing and documentation**

   Learn how you can ensure that model documentation includes custom tests and how to make test configuration changes that apply to all tests in the model documentation template. At the end of this section you should have a fully documented model ready for review.

PR #67: Support for external models
URL: https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/67
Labels: enhancement, highlight
--->
### Support for external models

You can now run documentation tests without passing a Python-native model object. This change enables you to document:

- Models that are developed in non-Python environments
- Non-standard model interfaces:
  - Models deployed as APIs, such as SageMaker model endpoints
  - Tools such as Spark where a model is not a typical object that exposes a `predict()` interface

To run tests for these models, you typically must load model predictions from a file, dataset, and so on. The new `init_model` interface does not enforce a Python model object anymore. You only need to pass `attributes` that describe the model which is required as a best practice for model documentation.

#### Initializing an external model

Since there is no native Python object to pass to `init_model`, you instead pass attributes that describe the model:

```python
# Assume you want to load predictions for a PySpark ML model

model_attributes = {
    "architecture": "Spark",
    "language": "PySpark",
}

# Or maybe you're loading predictions for a SageMaker endpoint (model API)
model_attributes = {
    "architecture": "SageMaker Model",
    "language": "Python",
}

# Call `init_model` without passing a model. Pass `attributes` instead.
vm_model = vm.init_model(
    attributes=model_attributes,
    input_id="model",
)
```

#### Assigning predictions

Since there's no model object available, the developer framework won't be able to call `model.predict()` or `model.predict_proba()`. You need to load predictions and probabilities manually. For example:

```python
vm_train_ds.assign_predictions(
    model=vm_model,
    prediction_values=prediction_values,
    prediction_probabilities=prediction_probabilities,
)
```

You can proceed to run tests on your data as you would under normal conditions, without needing to modify any other parts of your code.

PR #29: Custom Metric Function Decorator
URL: https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/29
Labels: enhancement, highlight
--->
### Custom metric function decorator

We introduced a new `metric` decorator that turns any function into a ValidMind Metric that you can use in your documentation.

Custom metrics offer added flexibility. They allow you to extend the library of default metrics provided by ValidMind which enables you to document any type of model or use case.

This new decorator simplifies creating and using custom metrics by almost completely eliminating the boilerplate code required to define and register a custom metric.

PR #728: feat: add, remove, and rename sections with the new template editing experience
URL: https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/728
Labels: highlight, servicerocket
--->
### New documentation template editor

This update allows you to edit documentation templates visually, eliminating the need to manually edit YAML files. Add, remove, and rename sections with the new edit.r

Key features:

**Enhanced template setting page**

- The edit button next to the version dropdown is now hidden.
- A new edit button is displayed above the accordions. Clicking this button activates the edit mode for the accordion.

**Edit mode functionality**

- In edit mode, you see a cancel button to exit edit mode and a button to publish a new version of the template with the current changes.
- You can edit section titles when the accordion is in edit mode.
- You can insert new sections before or after an existing section or insert a sub-section.
- You can remove sections, with a confirmation alert to ensure the action.

This new visual editing interface streamlines the template editing process, making it more intuitive and user-friendly.

PR #687: Workflows 2
URL: https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/687
Labels: highlight
--->
### Better UI for workflow customization

Our revamped workflow UI enables more granular management of model and documentation lifecycles and deep integration with model inventory attributes.

The new workflows UI includes the following features:

- Ability to require a user action (approve, reject, request changes, etc.) before updating the status of a resource. The user action is presented to relevant users as an action button.

- Ability to define the conditions that need to be met before allowing state transitions on a workflow. These conditions are evaluated from attribute values of the inventory model.

- Support for approval steps. Approval steps allow you to define the model attribute where a list of approvers needs retrieval and specify the percentage of approvals needed for a successful approval.

- Approval steps allow defining approved and rejected outcomes.


## Enhancements

PR #27: Support adding new extra columns on the fly
URL: https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/27
Labels: enhancement
--->
### Support adding new extra columns on the fly

Added support for two new VMDataset methods

`add_extra_column()` and `get_extra_column()`

`add_extra_column()`

You can now register arbitrary extra columns in a dataset when a test needs to compute metrics outside of the existing sets of columns (features, targets, predictions). An example is when credit risk-related metrics require access to a list of scores computed from predictions. In this case, there needs to be an extra column called `scores` that is used for computing the metrics.

example usage:

```
python
# init your dataset as usual
vm_train_ds = vm.init_dataset(
    dataset=train_df,
    input_id="train_dataset",
    target_column=customer_churn.target_column,
)

# generate scores using a user defined function:
scores = compute_my_scores(x_train)

# assign a new "scores" column to vm_train_ds:
vm_train_ds.add_extra_column("scores", scores)
```

This function throws an error if no column values are passed:

```
python
vm_train_ds.add_extra_column("scores")
ValueError: Column values must be provided when the column doesn't exist in the dataset
```

You can use `init_dataset` with a dataset that has precomputed scores:

```
>

train_df.columns

index(
['CreditScore',
 'Gender',
 'Age',
 'Tenure',
 'Balance',
 'NumOfProducts',

'HasCrCard', 
'IsActiveMember', 
'EstimatedSalary', 
'Exited',

'Geography_France', 
'Geography_Germany', 
'Geography_Spain']
,

dtype='object')
```

```
>

train_df["my_scores"] = scores

>

train_df.columns

index(
['CreditScore',
 'Gender',
 'Age',
 'Tenure',
 'Balance',
 'NumOfProducts',

'HasCrCard', 
'IsActiveMember', 
'EstimatedSalary', 
'Exited',

'Geography_France', 
'Geography_Germany', 
'Geography_Spain',

'my_scores']
,

dtype='object')
```

Make sure you set the `feature_columns` properly:

```
python
vm_train_ds = vm.init_dataset(
    dataset=train_df,
    input_id="another_ds",
    feature_columns=[
        "CreditScore",
        "Gender",
        "Age",
        "Tenure",
        "Balance",
        "NumOfProducts",
        "HasCrCard",
        "IsActiveMember",
        "EstimatedSalary",
        "Exited",
        "Geography_France",
        "Geography_Germany",
        "Geography_Spain"
    ],
    target_column=customer_churn.target_column,
)
```

Then call `add_extra_column()` to register the extra column:

```
>

another_ds.add_extra_column(column_name="my_scores")

Column my_scores exists in the dataset, registering as an extra column
```


`get_extra_column()`

You can use this inside a test to retrieve the extra column values. Example:

```
python
scores = self.inputs.dataset.get_extra_column("scores")
```

### Metric decorator should work with test providers

Adding support for functional metrics for internal tests and test providers

Continuing our efforts to simplify the process for getting your custom code working in ValidMind, we now support functional metrics. Functional metrics are tests that can be defined as pure functions without any boilerplate.

See how this works and more in our
[updated tutorial on custom test providers](https://docs.validmind.ai/notebooks/code_samples/custom_tests/external_test_providers.html).

This allows:

- Assign prediction values and probabilities that have been computed outside ValidMind (VM).
- Incorporate prediction values and probabilities from datasets that already have prediction columns.
- Automate the assignment of prediction values and probabilities within VM.

PR #173: First draft for sandbox instructions

### First draft for sandbox instructions

We added getting started information for the new ValidMind sandbox environment. You use the sandbox to gain hands-on experience and explore what ValidMind has to offer.

The sandbox mimics a production environment. It includes comprehensive resources such as notebooks with sample code you can run, sample models registered in the model inventory, and draft documentation and validation reports.

Most of our model documentation features are available for you to test in the sandbox. This includes:

- automated model testing & documentation
- preparing model validation reports
- large language model (`LLM`) support

These features provide a rich context for testing and evaluation. You can use realistic models and datasets without any risk to your production environment.
