By juxtaposing the model's predictions under baseline and shocked conditions, users can visually evaluate the sensitivity of the model to changes in each variable. This kind of analysis can also shed light on potential model limitations, including over-reliance on specific variables or insufficient responsiveness to changes in inputs. As a result, this test suite can provide insights that may be beneficial for refining the model structure, improving its robustness, and ensuring a more reliable prediction performance.</td>

<td id="T_cd965_row2_col1" class="data row2 col1">**Purpose**: The purpose of the Descriptive Statistics metric is to provide a comprehensive summary of both numerical and categorical data within a dataset. For numerical data, it gathers statistics such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values, as well as certain percentiles. For categorical data, it calculates the count, number of unique values, most frequent value, frequency of the most common value, and the proportion of the most frequent value relative to the total. This metric aids in visualizing the overall distribution of the variables in the dataset, which in turn assists in understanding the model's behavior and predicting its performance. **Test Mechanism**: The test mechanism involves using the describe() function for numerical fields which computes several summary statistics and value_counts() for categorical fields which counts unique values. Both of these functions are built-in methods of pandas dataframes. The results are then formatted to create two separate tables, one for numerical and one for categorical variable summaries. These tables provide a clear summary of the main characteristics of these variables, which can be crucial in assessing the model's performance. **Signs of High Risk**: High risks can be found in evidence of skewed data or notable outliers. This could be reflected in the mean and median (50% percentile) having a significant difference, in the case of numerical data. For categorical data, high risk can be indicated by a lack of diversity (low count of unique values), or overdominance of a single category (high frequency of the top value). **Strengths**: The primary strength of this metric lies in its ability to provide a comprehensive summary of the dataset, providing insights on the distribution and characteristics of the variables under consideration. It is a flexible and robust method, relevant to both numerical and categorical data. It can help highlight anomalies such as outliers, extreme skewness, or lack of diversity which can be essential in understanding model behavior during testing and validation. **Limitations**: While this metric provides a high-level overview of the data, it may not be sufficient to detect subtle correlations or complex patterns in the data. It does not provide any info on the relationship between variables. Plus, descriptive statistics alone cannot be used to infer properties about future unseen data. It should be used in conjunction with other statistical tests to provide a thorough understanding of the model's data.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row0_col2" class="data row0 col2">**Purpose:** Bias Evaluation is aimed at assessing if and how the distribution and order of exemplars (examples) within a few-shot learning prompt affect the Language Learning Model's (LLM) output, potentially introducing biases. By examining these influences, we can optimize the model's performance and mitigate unintended biases in its responses. **Test Mechanism:** 1. **Distribution of Exemplars:** Check how varying the number of positive vs. negative examples in a prompt impacts the LLM's classification of a neutral or ambiguous statement. 2. **Order of Exemplars:** Examine if the sequence in which positive and negative examples are presented can sway the LLM's response. For each test case, an LLM is used to grade the input prompt on a scale from 1 to 10, based on whether the examples in the prompt may lead to biased responses. A minimum threshold must be met in order for the test to pass. By default, this threshold is set to 7, but it can be adjusted as needed via the test parameters.</td>

With clear prompts, the LLM is better suited to more accurately and effectively interpret and respond to instructions in the prompt **Test Mechanism:** Using an LLM, prompts are scrutinized for clarity, considering aspects like detail inclusion, persona adoption, step-by-step instructions, use of examples, and desired output length. Each prompt is graded on a scale from 1 to 10 based on its clarity. Prompts scoring at or above a predetermined threshold (default is 7) are marked as clear. This threshold can be adjusted via the test parameters. **Why Clarity Matters:** Clear prompts minimize the room for misinterpretation, allowing the LLM to generate more relevant and accurate responses. Ambiguous or vague instructions might leave the model guessing, leading to suboptimal outputs. **Tactics for Ensuring Clarity that will be referenced during evaluation:** 1. **Detail Inclusion:** Provide essential details or context to prevent the LLM from making assumptions. 2. **Adopt a Persona:** Use system messages to specify the desired persona for the LLM's responses. 3. **Specify Steps:** For certain tasks, delineate the required steps explicitly, helping the model in sequential understanding. 4. **Provide Examples:** While general instructions are efficient, in some scenarios, "few-shot" prompting or style examples can guide the LLM more effectively. 5. **Determine Output Length:** Define the targeted length of the response, whether in terms of paragraphs, bullet points, or other units. While word counts aren't always precise, specifying formats like paragraphs can offer more predictable results.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row2_col2" class="data row2 col2">**Purpose:** The Specificity Test aims to assess the clarity, precision, and effectiveness of prompts provided to a Language Learning Model (LLM). Ensuring specificity in the prompts given to an LLM can significantly influence the accuracy and relevance of its outputs. The goal of this test is to ascertain that the instructions in a prompt are unmistakably clear and relevant, eliminating ambiguity and steering the LLM toward desired outcomes. **Test Mechanism:** Utilizing an LLM, each prompt is graded on a specificity scale ranging from 1 to 10. The grade reflects how well the prompt adheres to principles of clarity, detail, and relevancy without being overly verbose. Prompts that achieve a grade equal to or exceeding a predefined threshold (default set to 7) are deemed to pass the evaluation, while those falling below are marked as failing. This threshold can be adjusted as needed. **Why Specificity Matters:** Prompts that are detailed and descriptive often yield better and more accurate results from an LLM. Rather than relying on specific keywords or tokens, it's crucial to have a well-structured and descriptive prompt. Including relevant examples within the prompt can be particularly effective, guiding the LLM to produce outputs in desired formats. However, it's essential to strike a balance. While prompts need to be detailed, they shouldn't be overloaded with unnecessary information. The emphasis should always be on relevancy and conciseness, considering there are limitations to how long a prompt can be. **Example:** Imagine wanting an LLM to extract specific details from a given text. A vague prompt might yield varied results. However, with a prompt like, "Extract the names of all characters and the cities they visited from the text", the LLM is guided more precisely towards the desired information extraction.</td>

The primary objective is to ensure that prompts consistently produce accurate and desired outputs, even in diverse or challenging scenarios. **Test Mechanism:** Prompts are subjected to various conditions, alterations, and contexts to check their stability in eliciting consistent responses from the LLM. Factors such as different phrasings, inclusion of potential distractors, and varied input complexities are introduced to test the robustness of the prompt. By default, the test generates 10 inputs for the prompt but this can be adjusted via the test parameters. **Why Robustness Matters:** A robust prompt ensures consistent performance and reduces the likelihood of unexpected or off-tangent outputs. This consistency is vital for applications where predictability and reliability of the LLM's response are paramount.</td>

By focusing on what should be done rather than what should be avoided, prompts can guide the LLM more effectively towards generating appropriate and desired outputs. **Test Mechanism:** Employing an LLM as an evaluator, each prompt is meticulously analyzed and graded on use of positive instructions on a scale from 1 to 10. The grade indicates how well the prompt employs affirmative language while avoiding negative or prohibitive instructions. Prompts that achieve a grade equal to or exceeding a predetermined threshold (default set to 7) are recognized as adhering to positive instruction best practices. This threshold can be adjusted via the test parameters. **Why Positive Instructions Matter:** Prompts that are phrased in the affirmative, emphasizing what to do, tend to direct the LLM more clearly than those that focus on what not to do. Negative instructions can lead to ambiguities and undesired model responses. By emphasizing clarity and proactive guidance, we optimize the chances of obtaining relevant and targeted responses from the LLM. **Example:** Consider a scenario involving a chatbot designed to recommend movies. An instruction framed as, "Don't recommend movies that are horror or thriller" might cause the LLM to fixate on the genres mentioned, inadvertently producing undesired results. On the other hand, a positively-framed prompt like, "Recommend family-friendly movies or romantic comedies" provides clear guidance on the desired output.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row5_col2" class="data row5 col2">**Purpose:** The Conciseness Assessment is designed to evaluate the brevity and succinctness of prompts provided to a Language Learning Model (LLM). A concise prompt strikes a balance between offering clear instructions and eliminating redundant or unnecessary information, ensuring that the LLM receives relevant input without being overwhelmed. **Test Mechanism:** Using an LLM, this test puts input prompts through a conciseness analysis where it's graded on a scale from 1 to 10. The grade reflects how well the prompt maintains clarity while avoiding verbosity. Prompts that achieve a grade equal to or surpassing a predefined threshold (default set to 7) are considered successful in being concise. This threshold can be adjusted based on specific requirements. **Why Conciseness Matters:** While detailed prompts can guide an LLM towards accurate results, excessive details can clutter the instruction and potentially lead to undesired outputs. Concise prompts are straightforward, reducing ambiguity and focusing the LLM's attention on the primary task. This is especially important considering there are limitations to the length of prompts that can be fed to an LLM. **Example:** For an LLM tasked with summarizing a document, a verbose prompt might introduce unnecessary constraints or biases. A concise, effective prompt like, "Provide a brief summary highlighting the main points of the document" ensures that the LLM captures the essence of the content without being sidetracked.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row6_col2" class="data row6 col2">**Purpose:** The Delimitation Test ensures that prompts provided to the Language Learning Model (LLM) use delimiters correctly to distinctly mark sections of the input. Properly delimited prompts simplify the LLM's interpretation process, ensuring accurate and precise responses. **Test Mechanism:** Using an LLM, prompts are checked for their appropriate use of delimiters such as triple quotation marks, XML tags, and section titles. Each prompt receives a score from 1 to 10 based on its delimitation integrity. Prompts scoring at or above a set threshold (default is 7) pass the check. This threshold can be modified as needed. **Why Proper Delimitation Matters:** Delimiters play a crucial role in segmenting and organizing prompts, especially when diverse data or multiple tasks are involved. They help in clearly distinguishing between different parts of the input, reducing ambiguity for the LLM. As task complexity increases, the correct use of delimiters becomes even more critical to ensure the LLM understands the prompt's intent. **Example:** When given a prompt like: ```USER: Summarize the text delimited by triple quotes. '''insert text here'''``` or: ```USER:
insert first article here
insert second article here
``` The LLM can more accurately discern sections of the text to be treated differently, thanks to the clear delimitation.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row7_col2" class="data row7 col2">**Purpose**: BERTScore is a metric used to evaluate the quality of text generation models, focusing on the similarity between the reference text and the generated text. It leverages the contextual embeddings from BERT models to evaluate the similarity of the contents. Therefore, it distinctively measures how well a model has learned and can generate context-relevant results. **Test Mechanism**: This metric derives the true values from the model's testing set and the model's predictions. BERTScore evaluates the precision, recall, and F1 score of the model according to the contextual similarity between the reference and the generated text. These scores are calculated for each token in the candidate sentences as compared to the reference sentences, taking into account cosine similarity with BERT embeddings. A line plot is generated for each metric (Precision, Recall and F1 Score), which visualizes the score changes across row indexes. **Signs of High Risk**: If there's a general downward trend in Precision, Recall, or F1 Score or any noticeable instability/fluctuation in these metrics, it indicates high risk. A low Precision implies that predictions often include irrelevant contexts. A low Recall implies the models miss relevant contexts in predictions. A low F1 score indicates poor overall performance in both precision and recall. **Strengths**: BERTScore is potent in detecting the quality of text that requires understanding the context, which is a typical demand in natural language processing tasks. This metric goes beyond simple n-gram matching and considers the semantic similarity in the context, which provides more meaningful evaluation results. The visualization allows observing the performance trends across different sets of predictions. **Limitations**: BERTScore is dependent on BERT model embeddings; therefore, if the base BERT model is not well-suited for a specific task, it may impact the accuracy of BERTScore. In addition, although good at semantic understanding, it might not capture some nuances in text similarity that other metrics like BLEU or ROUGE can detect. Finally, it can be computationally expensive due to the use of BERT embeddings.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row8_col2" class="data row8 col2">**Purpose**: The Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) metric measures the quality of machine-translated text by comparing it to human-translated text. This comparison is done at the sentence level and is designed to bring machine translations closer to the quality of a professional human translation. It is commonly used in the field of translation evaluation, and its purpose is to assess the accuracy of a model's output against that of a benchmark. **Test Mechanism**: The implementation of the BLEU score involves using the NLTK's word_tokenize function to split the text into individual words, upon which the BLEU score can be calculated. The method employs the evaluate library's BLEU metric to compute the BLEU score for each translated sentence, comparing the model's translations (predictions) against the actual, correct translations (references). The results are returned as a single score which indicates the average 'distance' between the generated translations and the human translations across the entire test set. **Signs of High Risk**: Low BLEU scores indicate high model risk. This occurs when there is a significant discrepancy between the machine translation and its human equivalent. This may be due to the model not learning effectively, overfitting the training data, or not handling the nuances of the language effectively. Machine bias toward a certain language style or mode of translation can also result in lower scores. **Strengths**: The main strength of the BLEU score is its simplicity and interpretability. It provides an intuitive way to assess the quality of translated texts that can correlate well with human judgements. Additionally, it operates at a granular level (sentence level), enabling more precise assessment of errors. Lastly, it encapsulates the performance of the model with a single, comprehensive score that is easy to compare and monitor. **Limitations**: The BLEU score places emphasis on exact matches, which can lead to bias in favor of literal translations. As a result, it may not fully capture the quality of more complex or flexible translations that don't adhere strictly to a word-for-word structure. Another limitation is that it doesn't directly evaluate the intelligibility or grammatical correctness of the translations. Moreover, it may not identify errors that arise from subtle nuances in language, cultural contexts, or ambiguities.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row9_col1" class="data row9 col1">Contextual Recall</td>
<td id="T_9d30f_row9_col2" class="data row9 col2">**Purpose**: The Contextual Recall metric is utilized to gauge the proficiency of a natural language generation (NLG) model in crafting textual content that remains coherent and consistent with the presented context or prompt. It quantifies the model's aptitude to recollect and mirror the foundational context in its resultant output. In the realm of NLP tasks, it's paramount that models generate text reflecting contextual relevance. **Test Mechanism**: 1. **Prepare Reference and Candidate Texts**: - **Reference Texts**: Gather your reference text(s) which epitomize the expected or ideal output for a designated context or prompt. - **Candidate Texts**: Using the same context, generate candidate text(s) from the NLG model under evaluation. 2. **Tokenization and Preprocessing**: - Tokenize both the reference and candidate texts into discernible words or tokens, using established libraries like NLTK. 3. **Compute Contextual Recall**: - Ascertain the overlap of tokens between the reference and candidate texts. - The Contextual Recall score is deduced by dividing the number of overlapping tokens by the total token count of the reference text. The assessment is made for each test dataset instance, resulting in an array of scores. This series of scores is then illustrated via a line plot, showing score variations across rows. **Signs of High Risk**: Low contextual recall scores are red flags. They imply that the model isn't efficiently echoing the original context in its generated content, culminating in outputs that are incoherent or contextually off-track. A persistent trend of low recall scores could presage model underperformance. **Strengths**: The standout attribute of the contextual recall metric is its ability to quantifiably gauge a model's adherence to, and recollection of, both the context and factual elements in the generated narrative. This proves invaluable in applications demanding profound context comprehension, such as text continuation or interactive dialogue systems. The accompanying line plot visualization offers a lucid and intuitive representation of score variations. **Limitations**: Although potent, the Contextual Recall metric might not holistically represent all dimensions of NLG model performance. Its predominant focus on word overlap might award high scores to texts that employ numerous common words, even if they lack coherence or meaningful context. It also bypasses the significance of word order, which might lead to inflated scores for scrambled outputs. Lastly, infrequent words, despite being used aptly, might not match as often, potentially undervaluing models proficient in their application.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row10_col2" class="data row10 col2">**Purpose**: ROUGE, or Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation, serves as a robust metric framework aimed at evaluating the caliber of machine-generated text. Especially pertinent in the arena of natural language generation tasks, such as text summarization, machine translation, and text generation, its overarching goal is to ascertain how effectively the machine-rendered text mirrors key information and concepts present in reference human-crafted text. Owing to its efficacy, the ROUGE metrics have become staples in the NLP community for the assessment of text generation systems. **Test Mechanism**: 1. **Comparison Basis**: At its core, ROUGE operates by juxtaposing machine-generated content with a reference human-constructed text. 2. **Incorporated Metrics**: - **ROUGE-N (N-gram Overlap)**: Focuses on the alignment of n-grams (sequential sets of n words) between the generated and reference texts. Typical n-values include 1 (unigrams), 2 (bigrams), and 3 (trigrams). Each metric calculates precision, recall, and F1-score components. - **ROUGE-L (Longest Common Subsequence)**: Pinpoints the most extended shared word sequence present in both the machine and reference texts, assessing the generated text's ability to encapsulate pivotal phrases. - **ROUGE-S (Skip-bigram)**: Measures the concurrence of skip-bigrams, which are word pairings appearing within a designated word window in the text. This metric is sensitive to word ordering but tolerates sporadic word omissions. 3. **Visual Representation**: The determined precision, recall, and F1-score for each metric are plotted visually, ensuring streamlined comprehension of the results. **Signs of High Risk**: Warning signs under this metric umbrella encompass low scores across the ROUGE suite. A diminished precision could insinuate the presence of redundant information in machine-produced text, while a low recall might denote the omission of salient data from the reference text. A decreased F1 score pinpoints a suboptimal harmony between precision and recall. Persistent low scores, especially across diverse test sets, may herald intrinsic flaws in the model's prowess. **Strengths**: ROUGE's primary asset is its multifaceted view on text quality, enabled by an array of evaluation metrics. It graciously accommodates synonyms and rephrasing due to its n-gram-based approach, and it champions the retention of salient word sequences via the longest common subsequence tactic. The visual representation of precision, recall, and F1-scores facilitates an intuitive grasp of model efficacy. **Limitations**: In spite of its advantages, certain constraints tether ROUGE. It might not adequately address the semantic coherence, fluency, or grammatical integrity of the generated narrative, leaning more towards evaluating isolated phrases or n-grams. The metric can be less discerning when critiquing elaborate sentences due to its fragmentary nature. Moreover, as it banks on comparisons with human-made references, procuring such benchmarks can be challenging or even impractical at times.</td>

Such metadata includes the model's architecture (modeling technique), the version and type of modeling framework used, and the programming language the model is written in. **Test Mechanism:** The mechanism of this test consists of extracting information from the model instance. It tries to extract the model information such as the modeling technique used, the modeling framework version, and the programming language. It decorates this information into a data frame and returns a summary of the results. **Signs of High Risk:** High risk could be determined by a lack of documentation or inscrutable metadata for the model. For instance, unidentifiable language, outdated or unsupported versions of modeling frameworks, or undisclosed model architectures reflect risky situations, as they could hinder future reproducibility, support, and debugging of the model. **Strengths:** The strengths of this test lie in the increased transparency and understanding it brings regarding the model's setup. Knowing the model's architecture, the specific modeling framework version used, and the language involved, provides multiple benefits: supports better error understanding and debugging, facilitates model reuse, aids compliance of software policies, and assists in planning for model obsolescence due to evolving or discontinuing software and dependencies. **Limitations:** Notably, this test is largely dependent on the compliance and correctness of information provided by the model or the model developer. If the model's built-in methods for describing its architecture, framework or language are incorrect or lack necessary information, this test will hold limitations. Moreover, it is not designed to directly evaluate the performance or accuracy of the model, rather it provides supplementary information which aids in comprehensive analysis.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row12_col2" class="data row12 col2">**Purpose**: The purpose of the Token Disparity metric is to evaluate the distributional match between the predicted and actual outputs (tokens) of the model. This is done by creating a comparison through histograms that outline the disparity in the number of tokens in both columns. The metric is also used to assess the verbosity of the model's predictions in comparison to the actual data. **Test Mechanism**: The test is implemented by tokenizing the two columns: one for the real data and the other for the generated or predicted data. It uses the BERT tokenizer to tokenize the content of each column. Then, it counts the tokens in each column. These counts are then arranged into two different histograms to visualize the distribution of token counts in the real data and the generated data. The metric quantifies the distribution disparity by comparing the histogram of the true tokens with the histogram of predicted tokens. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or failures might be indicated by significant differences in distribution typologies between the two histograms, especially if the predicted histogram considerably diverges from the reference histogram. It may signify that the model is generating outputs with unexpected verbosity, resulting in either far too many or too few tokens than expected. **Strengths**: The primary strength of this metric is that it provides a clear and visual comparison of predicted versus actual token distributions in the model. It helps in understanding the consistency and quality of the model's output in terms of length and verbosity. It also allows detection of potential issues in the model's output generation capabilities, such as over-generation or under-generation of tokens compared to the actual data. **Limitations**: This metric focuses strictly on the count of tokens without considering the semantics behind the tokens. Therefore, it may overlook issues related to the meaningfulness or relevance of the produced tokens. Furthermore, it assumes that a similar distribution of token counts between predicted and actual data implies accurate output, which may not always hold true. Also, it depends on the BERT tokenizer which may not be the best tokenizer for all kinds of text data.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row13_col2" class="data row13 col2">**Purpose**: This test is designed to assess the performance of a Machine Learning model on out-of-sample data - i.e., data not used during the training phase. This test uses a variety of metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) to evaluate how well the trained model generalizes to unseen data. It helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting the training data and is capable of making accurate predictions on new, unseen data. **Test Mechanism**: The test invokes the metrics on the model's predicted outcomes for the testing data set and compares those predictions to the actual outcomes. If the testing data set is properly set aside during the model training and is not used in any way in the model learning process, it should provide a fair and unbiased measure of how well the model can generalize. The metrics used typically include accuracy (proportion of correct predictions), precision (proportion of positive predictions that were correct), recall (proportion of actual positives that were predicted correctly), and F1 score (a single statistic that balances precision and recall). **Signs of High Risk**: Indications of high risk might include a low accuracy rate, low precision and recall rates, a low F1 score, or significant discrepancies between the model's performance on training data and on testing data. The latter may point to overfitting, meaning the model may not generalize well to new data. **Strengths**: The major strength of this test is its ability to measure a model's predictive performance on unseen data, thereby giving a fair estimate of its generalizability. This test takes into account various performance metrics to provide a comprehensive performance evaluation. It also helps detect overfitting, an important aspect to consider for any machine learning model. **Limitations**: This test's limitations are centered around the dependability of the test dataset. If the test dataset is not a good representative of the real-world data the model will be applied to, the performance metrics may not accurately reflect the true performance of the model. It's also worth noting that all the metrics used (accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score) assume that all errors or misclassifications are equally important, which is not always the case in real-world scenarios.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row14_col2" class="data row14 col2">**Purpose**: The purpose of this test is to evaluate the robustness of a machine learning model. Robustness refers to a model's ability to maintain a high level of performance in the face of perturbations or changes—particularly noise—added to its input data. Such simulated scenarios help to assess if the model can handle situations where the input data might be incomplete or corrupted. **Test Mechanism**: This test method works by adding Gaussian noise, proportional to a certain standard deviation scale, to input features (only numerical) of both the training and testing datasets. The performance of the model with perturbed features is then computed based on a metric (default is 'accuracy'). This process is iterated over a list of defined scale factors. The results are then visualized using a line chart, depicting the accuracy trend against the amount of noise introduced. A threshold is set to determine the decay in accuracy due to perturbation that is deemed acceptable. **Signs of High Risk**: Signs of high risk include significant drops in accuracy when noise is introduced to feature inputs. If the decay in accuracy breaches the configured threshold, it is a strong indicator of a high-risk condition. High risk may also pertain to a situation where one or more elements provided in the features list do not match with the training dataset's numerical feature columns. **Strengths**: The robustness diagnosis test offers the following advantages: - It provides an empirical measure of the model's performance in handling noise or data perturbations, offering insights into the model's reliability and stability. - The test is flexible and customizable with the ability to select specific features to perturb and to control the noise level applied. - Detailed results visualization aids in the interpretability of robustness testing. **Limitations**: Despite the benefits, the test also exhibits some limitations: - It only perturbs the numerical features while leaving out features of non-numerical types, potentially providing an incomplete robustness analysis. - Default metric used is accuracy which might not always provide the best measure of a model's success, especially for imbalanced datasets. - The test is reliant on the assumption that the injected Gaussian noise is an adequate representation of potential corruption or incompleteness in real-world data. - The set decay threshold for accuracy might need to be fine-tuned or adjusted based on domain knowledge or specific project requirements. - The test might not perform as expected for datasets with a text column.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row15_col2" class="data row15 col2">**Purpose:** The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) Global Importance metric illuminates the outcomes of machine learning models by attributing them to the contributing features. It assigns a quantifiable global importance to features via their absolute Shapley values, making it applicable for tasks such as classification (both binary and multiclass). This metric is pivotal in the model risk management strategy. **Test Mechanism:** The first step involves choosing an appropriate explainer that matches the model type: TreeExplainer for tree-based models (like XGBClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, CatBoostClassifier) and LinearExplainer for linear ones (such as LogisticRegression, XGBRegressor, LinearRegression). Once the explainer calculates the Shapley values, they are visualized through two specific plots: 1. **Mean Importance Plot**: This graph denotes the significance of each feature grounded in its absolute Shapley values. By computing the average of these absolute Shapley values across the entire dataset, the global importance of features is elucidated. 2. **Summary Plot**: This visual representation amalgamates the importance of each feature with their effects. Each dot on this plot symbolizes a Shapley value for a distinct feature in a specific instance. The vertical axis represents the feature, while the horizontal axis corresponds to the Shapley value. A color gradient, shifting from low to high, marks the feature's value. Overlapping points experience a slight vertical dispersion, offering a snapshot of the Shapley values' distribution for each attribute. Features are methodically aligned in accordance with their prominence. The function `_generate_shap_plot()` renders these plots with the aforementioned types. **Signs of High Risk:** Overly dominant features in SHAP importance plots hint at potential model overfitting. Anomalies, like unexpected or speculative features flaunting high importance, could suggest that the model's decisions are rooted in incorrect or undesirable reasoning. Moreover, a SHAP summary plot teeming with high variability or scattered data points is a cause for concern. **Strengths:** Beyond delineating global feature significance, SHAP offers a granular perspective on how individual attributes shape the model's decision logic for each instance. This advanced method unravels model behavior with clarity. Its flexibility is evident in its support for a diverse array of model types, ensuring uniform interpretations across different models. **Limitations:** For large datasets or intricate models, SHAP's computations might demand substantial time and resources. Moreover, its compatibility does not extend to every model class, especially models from libraries like "statsmodels", "pytorch", "catboost", "transformers", "FoundationModel", and "R". High-dimensional data can muddle interpretations, and linking importance to tangible real-world impact retains a degree of subjectivity.</td>

The matrix indicates how well the model can accurately distinguish true and false positives and negatives - basic indicators of model accuracy. **Test Mechanism**: The classification model's results (`y_test_predict`) are compared against the actual results (`y_test_true`). The unique labels identified from `y_test_true` are used to create a confusion matrix using scikit-learn's metrics. The matrix is then rendered using Plotly's `create_annotated_heatmap` function. Outcomes such as True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN) are plotted in a color-coded heatmap, providing a visualized 2D representation of the model's performance. **Signs of High Risk**: High risks associated with the model are signaled by high numbers of False Positives (FP) and False Negatives (FN), which demonstrates the model's inability to accurately classify. On the other hand, low numbers of True Positives (TP) and True Negatives (TN) also indicate problematic situation, meaning the model is unable to correctly identify the class labels. **Strengths**: Utilizing a Confusion Matrix has various strengths: - It allows a clear and simple visual summary of the classification model's prediction accuracy. - It provides explicit metrics for True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN), making it easy to highlight potential improvements. - It's beneficial for multi-class classification problems, since it can provide readability for complex models in a simplified manner. - It assists in understanding the different types of errors your model might make, by providing both Type-I and Type-II errors. **Limitations**: However, the Confusion Matrix also comes with limitations: - In conditions of unbalanced classes, the utility of the confusion matrix can be limited. It might quite erroneously perceive a model to perform well when it's merely predicting the majority class. - It does not deliver a single unified statistic that can appraise model performance. It merely indicates different facets of model performance separately. - It's largely a descriptive technique and does not allow for statistical hypothesis testing. - Misinterpretation risks also exist, as it doesn't directly provide precision, recall or F1-score data.

It measures commonly-used metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This test is typically used to gauge the model's ability to generalize its predictions to new, unseen data. It also measures the model's level of overfitting on the training set. **Test Mechanism**: This test uses metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. It applies these metrics to the model's predictions on the training set, and compares them with the true values. The accuracy measures the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. Precision gauges the number of true positive predictions relative to the total number of positive predictions. Recall indicates the number of true positive predictions relative to the total number of actual positives in the dataset. Finally, F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing an overall measure of the model's performance. **Signs of High Risk**: If the model has near perfect performance on all metrics on the training data but performs poorly on unseen data, it could be a sign of overfitting and hence, a high-risk scenario. Also, low values on any of these metrics can indicate an underperforming model, which may pose risk in production-grade applications. **Strengths**: Analyzing the model's performance using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score allows for a well-rounded assessment. The output is easy-to-interpret because they are widely used and understood in the machine learning community. Besides, since this test is applied to the training set, it can help detect instances of overfitting early in the model's development. **Limitations**: While these metrics provide useful insights, they are prone to biases in the training data. The model may perform well on the training set and yet perform poorly on new, unseen data. Therefore, this test should be complemented with additional validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation or out-of-sample testing, to ensure a less biased evaluation of the model's performance.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row18_col2" class="data row18 col2">**Purpose**: The OverfitDiagnosis is a specialized component designed to identify regions prone to overfitting through the utilization of histogram slicing techniques. The code purports to measure the discrepancies between the performance of the model on the training dataset and the testing dataset, segmented into distinct regions established based on the feature space. By identifying the overfitted regions or high residuals, the mechanism guides towards the subsequent application of regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization, dropout, or early stopping, or data augmentation to enhance the overall performance of the model and its generalization ability. **Test Mechanism**: The OverfitDiagnosis test is initiated by running the `run` method with pre-determined `default_params` and `default_metrics`, with 'accuracy' as the specified metric. The method executes the test by formulation distinct regions of the feature space based on binning techniques applied on feature columns from both training and testing datasets, further appending the predicted values. Each formed region is analyzed for performance discrepancies against actual values and the predictions of the model for both the datasets. The performance difference, referred to as the 'gap', is calculated and compared against a cut-off percentage indicating overfitting. In case of overfitting, the `run` method returns a **failed** status, while a successful test results in a **passed** status. Meanwhile, the function also prepares figures illustrating the overfitting regions. **Signs of High Risk**: The signs of high-risk associated with this model include: - A high value in the 'gap' between training and testing data accuracy - the larger the gap, the more overfit the model. - A high number and/or large regions of overfitting within the feature space. **Strengths**: - The technique allows for an insightful visual understanding by plotting overfitting regions. - Evaluates potential overfitting on a per-feature basis, allowing for more direct interventions. - Flexible test parameters such as 'cut_off_percentage' and 'features_column' for custom-tailored analysis. - Can handle both categorical and numerical features. **Limitations**: - Currently, this test only applies to classification tasks. Regression tasks are not supported. - Does not perform well with text-based features, limiting the utility in Natural Language Processing models. - Highly dependent on 'bins' setting which determines how the feature space is segmented. Different bin settings may produce different results. - Cut-off percentage for overfitting is arbitrary and no guideline is provided to set it optimally. - Performance metrics are limited to accuracy, limiting precision in the case of imbalanced datasets.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row19_col2" class="data row19 col2">**Purpose**: The purpose of the "Permutation Feature Importance" (PFI) metric is to quantify the importance of each feature used by the ML model. This is measured depending on how much the model's performance decreases when the values of each feature are permuted. **Test Mechanism**: The PFI metric is calculated using the `permutation_importance` method from the `sklearn.inspection` module. This function randomly permutes the columns of the feature dataset fed into the ML model and measures how the model's performance changes. If the model's performance worsens significantly after permuting a feature's values, that feature is deemed important. If the performance remains relatively constant, the feature is considered unimportant. At the end of the execution, PFI metric returns a figure displaying the feature importance of each feature. **Signs of High Risk**: An indication of risk would be if the model primarily depends on a feature whose values can easily be permuted or have high variance, suggesting instability. Another risk could be if there's a feature predicted as of no importance but is known to have significant influence on the expected outcome based on domain knowledge. **Strengths**: The PFI metric has several key advantages. It can provide an understanding of which features are crucial for the model's predictions, potentially revealing insights about the data's structure. This can also help determine if the model is overfitting on a particular feature or set of features. Moreover, PFI is model-agnostic and can be used for any classifier which can provide a measure of prediction accuracy before and after permuting features. **Limitations**: Although this metric is particularly helpful, there are some limitations too. The primary limitation is that feature importance calculated from this method does not imply causality—it only speaks to the amount of information the feature provides about the prediction task. Besides, permutation importance does not consider the interaction between features. If two features are correlated, the permutation importance might allocate importance to only one at the expense of the other. Finally, it cannot handle models from certain libraries like statsmodels, pytorch, catboost etc., thus limiting its applicability.</td>

The ROC AUC score is an indicator of how well the model is capable of distinguishing between different classes, making it a crucial measure in binary and multiclass classification tasks. **Test Mechanism**: This test implementation calculates the multiclass ROC AUC score on the true target values and the model's prediction. The test converts the multi-class target variables into binary format using `LabelBinarizer` before computing the score. If this ROC AUC score is higher than the predefined threshold (defaulted to 0.5), the test passes; otherwise, it fails. The results, including the ROC AUC score, the threshold, and whether the test passed or failed, are then stored in a `ThresholdTestResult` object. **Signs of High Risk**: A high risk or failure in the model's performance as related to this metric would be represented by a low ROC AUC score, specifically any score lower than the predefined minimum threshold. This suggests that the model is struggling to distinguish between different classes effectively. **Strengths**: This metric is advantageous for the following reasons: - The test considers both the true positive rate and false positive rate, providing a comprehensive performance measure. - ROC AUC score is threshold-independent meaning it measures the model's quality across various classification thresholds. - Works robustly with binary as well as multi-class classification problems. **Limitations**: Despite its strengths, the metric presents certain limitations: - ROC AUC may not be useful if the class distribution is highly imbalanced; it could perform well in terms of AUC but still fail to predict the minority class. - The test does not provide insight into what specific aspects of the model are causing poor performance if the ROC AUC score is unsatisfactory. - The use of macro average for multiclass ROC AUC score implies equal weightage to each class, which might not be appropriate if the classes are imbalanced.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row21_col2" class="data row21 col2">**Purpose**: The Precision Recall Curve metric is intended to evaluate the trade-off between precision and recall in classification models, particularly binary classification models. It assesses the model's capacity to produce accurate results (high precision), as well as its ability to capture a majority of all positive instances (high recall). **Test Mechanism**: The test extracts ground truth labels and prediction probabilities from the model's test dataset. It applies the precision_recall_curve method from the sklearn metrics module to these extracted labels and predictions, which computes a precision-recall pair for each possible threshold. This calculation results in an array of precision and recall scores that can be plotted against each other to form the Precision-Recall Curve. This curve is then visually represented by using Plotly's scatter plot. **Signs of High Risk**: A lower area under the Precision-Recall Curve signifies high risk. This corresponds to a model yielding a high amount of false positives (low precision) and/or false negatives (low recall). If the curve is closer to the bottom left of the plot, rather than being closer to the top right corner, it can be a sign of high risk. **Strengths**: This metric aptly represents the balance between precision (minimizing false positives) and recall (minimizing false negatives), which is especially critical in scenarios where both values are significant. Through the graphic representation, it enables an intuitive understanding of the model's performance across different threshold levels. **Limitations**: This metric is only applicable to binary classification models – it raises errors for multiclass classification models or Foundation models. Also, it may not fully represent the overall accuracy of the model if the cost of false positives and false negatives are extremely different, or if the dataset is heavily imbalanced.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row22_col2" class="data row22 col2">**Purpose**: The provided script assesses the performance of Machine Learning classification models. The performance is calculated by determining the precision, recall, F1-Score, accuracy, and the ROC AUC (Receiver operating characteristic - Area under the curve) scores. The test accepts both binary and multiclass models. **Test Mechanism**: The script generates a report that includes precision, recall, F1-Score, and accuracy using the `classification_report` method from the scikit-learn's metrics module. For multiclass models, weighted and macro averages for these scores are also computed. Additionally, the script calculates and includes the ROC AUC scores for the model using a custom method, `multiclass_roc_auc_score`. The output of the test is a structured report that differs depending on whether the model is binary or multiclass. **Signs of High Risk**: Indicators of high risk or a failing model include low values for the metrics used - precision, recall, F1-Score, accuracy, and ROC AUC. An imbalanced precision and recall score can also indicate a high-risk model, as precision focuses on the correct prediction of the positive class, while recall focuses on the number of correctly identified actual positive cases. A low ROC AUC score, particularly when it is close to 0.5 or below, is a strong indicator of a failing model. **Strengths**: This metric excels in its versatility by being capable of handling both binary and multiclass models. It computes several commonly used performance metrics, providing a comprehensive view of the model's performance. Using ROC-AUC as a metric can help in identifying the best threshold for classification, especially when datasets are unbalanced. **Limitations**: The test relies on labels being correctly identified for binary classification models, raising an exception if the positive class is not labeled as "1", which might not always be the case in practical applications. Furthermore, this script is designed only for classification models and cannot evaluate regression models. The calculated metrics might not be informative in situations where the test dataset is not representative of the data the model will encounter.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row23_col2" class="data row23 col2">**Purpose**: The primary purpose of this test is to ensure that the model's F1 score - a balanced reflection of both precision and recall - meets or surpasses a predetermined threshold on the validation dataset. This F1 score is a valuable measure of model performance in classification tasks, particularly where the proportion of positive and negative classes is imbalanced. **Test Mechanism**: The model's F1 score is calculated for the validation dataset via python's scikit-learn metrics. The scoring differs according to the classification problem: for multi-class, it uses macro averaging (calculating metrics separately then finding their unweighted mean), and for binary classification, it uses inherent f1_score calculation. The computed F1 score is then compared against the predetermined threshold - a minimum F1 score the model is expected to achieve. **Signs of High Risk**: Any model that returns an F1 score lower than the set threshold is considered high risk. A low F1 score could indicate that the model is not striking a desirable balance between precision and recall, or in simpler terms, it is not doing well in correctly identifying positive classes and limiting false positives. **Strengths**: This metric provides the advantage of being a balanced measure of a model's performance by considering both false positives and false negatives. It is particularly useful in scenarios with imbalanced class distribution, where accuracy can be misleading. It also allows for customization of the minimum acceptable performance by setting the threshold value. **Limitations**: This testing method may not be appropriate for all types of models and machine learning tasks. Also, while the F1 score captures a balanced view of a model's performance, it assumes equal cost for false positives and false negatives, which may not always be the case in certain real world scenarios. This limitation may compel practitioners to choose other metrics such as precision, recall, or the ROC-AUC score that align better with their specific needs.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row24_col2" class="data row24 col2">**Purpose**: The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a critical analysis tool for the performance of binary classification models. The ROC curve displays the trade-off between the True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) at varying threshold levels. The ROC curve, together with the Area Under the Curve (AUC), is designed to provide a measure of how well the model can discriminate between the two classes in a binary classification problem (e.g., default vs non-default). The higher the AUC score, the better the model is at correctly distinguishing between the positive and negative classes. **Test Mechanism**: This script extracts the target model and datasets, where binary classification is a requirement. Next, it computes predicted probabilities for the test set. It then calculates and plots the ROC curve using the true outcomes and predicted probabilities, along with the line representing randomness (AUC of 0.5). The AUC score for the ROC curve of the model is also computed, giving a numeric estimate of the model's performance. Any Infinite values in the ROC threshold are identified and removed in the process. The resulting ROC curve, AUC score, and thresholds are subsequently saved. **Signs of High Risk**: There would be a high risk associated with the performance of the model if the AUC score is below or close to 0.5, or if the ROC curve is observed to be closer to the line of randomness (indicating no discriminative power). It's essential to note that the AUC score must be significantly greater than 0.5 for the model to be considered effective at its classification task. **Strengths**: The ROC Curve provides a comprehensive visual representation of a model’s discriminative power over all possible classification thresholds, unlike metrics that only reveal model performance at a single set threshold. The AUC Score, which summarizes the ROC curve into a single value, remains consistent in the face of imbalanced datasets, making it an ideal choice for such cases. **Limitations**: This test is designed specifically for binary classification tasks, limiting its application to other model types. Additionally, it might not perform well for models that output probabilities severely skewed towards 0 or 1. In an extreme case, the ROC curve can exhibit high performance even in situations where the majority of classifications are incorrect, if the model's score ranking is preserved. This is known as the "class imbalance problem."</td>

This test serves as a measure to check the model's ability to generalize from its training data to unseen test data. It assesses key classification metric scores such as accuracy, precision, recall and f1 score, to verify the model's robustness and reliability. **Test Mechanism**: The code applies several predefined metrics including accuracy, precision, recall and f1 scores to the model's predictions for both the training and test datasets. It calculates the degradation as the difference between the training score and test score divided by the training score. The test is considered successful if the degradation for each metric is less than the preset maximum threshold of 10%. The results are summarized in a table showing each metric's train score, test score, degradation percentage, and pass/fail status. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or failure in the model's performance related to this test can be indicated by one or more of the following: 1. A degradation percentage that exceeds the maximum allowed threshold of 10% for any of the evaluated metrics. 2. A high difference or gap between the metric scores on the training and the test datasets. 3. The 'Pass/Fail' column displaying 'Fail' for any of the evaluated metrics. **Strengths**: 1. This test provides a quantitative measure of the model's ability to generalize to unseen data, which is key for predicting its practical real-world performance. 2. By evaluating multiple metrics, it takes into account different facets of model performance and enables a more holistic evaluation. 3. The use of a variable predefined threshold allows the flexibility to adjust the acceptability criteria for different scenarios. **Limitations**: 1. The test compares raw performance on training and test data, but does not factor in the nature of the data. Areas with less representation in the training set, for instance, might still perform poorly on unseen data. 2. It requires good coverage and balance in the test and training datasets to produce reliable results, which may not always be available. 3.

It uses a number of metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score among others, to measure model performance and aid in the selection of the most effective model for the given task. **Test Mechanism**: This test involves using Scikit-learn’s performance metrics to assess model's performance in both binary and multiclass classification tasks. To compare the performances, it evaluates each model on the test dataset and produces a detailed classification report. This includes the aforesaid metrics, along with the roc_auc score. Depending on whether the task at hand is binary or multiclass classification, it calculates metrics globally for the "positive" class or their weighted averages, macro averages, and per class metrics respectively. If no models are provided, the test is skipped. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or poor model performance might be indicated by low accuracy, precision, recall, and/or F1 scores, or a low area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (roc_auc).

It also includes ROC AUC, a robust performance metric that is capable of dealing effectively with class imbalance issues. **Limitations**: This test may not be comprehensive for more complex performance evaluations that consider other factors, such as speed of prediction, computational cost, or specific business constraints. It's also reliant on the provided test dataset, so the chosen models' performance could differ on unseen data or when the data distribution changes. The ROC AUC score isn't necessarily meaningful for multilabel/multiclass tasks, and can be hard to interpret in such contexts.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row27_col2" class="data row27 col2">**Purpose:** The weak spots test is designed to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model in specific regions of the feature space. This test consists of dividing the feature space into various sections or slices, evaluating the model's output within each of these sections, and identifying regions where the model's performance metrics fall below specified thresholds. Performance metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. This diagnostic test helps identify areas where the machine learning model may not perform well, potentially exposing its limitations and weaknesses. **Test Mechanism:** The test is performed by slicing the feature space of the training data set into multiple bins. For each bin, the model's performance metrics are computed for both the training and test data sets. If any of the model's performance metrics fall below the predetermined threshold for a particular bin on the test dataset, it is identified as a "weak spot". The results are visually represented in a bar chart for each performance metric, marking the bins failing the threshold. **Signs of High Risk:** High risk or failure in the model's performance is indicated when any of the model's performance metrics fall below the set thresholds. If any bin performed significantly worse in the test dataset compared to the training dataset, it might indicate overfitting in that region. Further, if a region or slice has low performance metrics, it suggests that the model does not handle that type of input data well, which may lead to inaccurate predictions. **Strengths:** - The weak spots test helps identify specific regions of the feature space where the model's performance is subpar, which can guide further refinement of the model. - Plotting the performance metrics provides an intuitive way to understand the model's performance across different regions. - The test can be customizable, allowing users to specify various thresholds for multiple performance metrics based on the needs of the specific application. **Limitations:** - By binning the feature space, the test could potentially oversimplify the model's behavior in each region. The granular control of this slicing depends on the bins parameter, and can be coincidentally arbitrary. - The test's effectiveness relies upon the chosen thresholds for the performance metrics, which may not be universally applicable and subject to the model's specification and the application. - The test does not handle datasets with a text column, thus limiting its applicability to only numerical or categorical data. - The test does not directly provide suggestions for model improvement, only highlighting potentially problematic regions.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row28_col2" class="data row28 col2">**Purpose:** The Population Stability Index (PSI) is used to evaluate how stable a predictive model's score distribution is when two different datasets are compared - typically a development and a validation dataset or two separate time periods. This assessment aids in understanding if a significant shift has occurred in the model's performance over time or if there has been a severe change in population characteristics. **Test Mechanism:** In this script, the test mechanism involves comparing the PSI between the training and test datasets. The data from each dataset is sorted and placed into either fixed bins or quantiles. The bin boundaries are established based on the initial population in the case of quantiles. The values in the bins are counted and the proportions calculated. The PSI is then calculated for each bin using a logarithmic transformation of the ratio of the proportions. A summarising table and a grouped bar chart alongside a scatter plot are created showing the PSI, and percentage of original and new data in each bin. **Signs of High Risk:** Signs of high risk would be captured by a high PSI value. A high PSI indicates a dramatic shift in the model's performance or a significant change in population attributes, suggesting that the model may not be performing as expected. **Strengths:** The PSI approach helps assess the stability of a model over time or across samples, which is critical for understanding if the model's performance has changed significantly. It provides a quantitative measure (the PSI value) that allows for direct comparisons across features. The calculation and interpretation of PSI is straightforward making it an effective tool for model validation. The visual display further aids for better understanding. **Limitations:** One potential drawback is that the PSI test doesn't take into account the interdependence between features. It also doesn't provide insights into why the distributions are different. Additionally, PSI may not adequately handle features with significant outliers. Finally, the test is performed here on the model predictions, not on the underlying data distributions - differences in PSI could be due to feature drift, model drift, or both combined, without a clear way to distinguish between them.</td>

Accuracy is the fraction of predictions our model got right and is an essential metric to understand how well our model is performing. In the context of both binary and multiclass classifications, accurate labeling is crucial. **Test Mechanism**: The mechanism of this threshold test involves comparing the model's accuracy score against the minimum threshold value specified (default value is 0.7). The accuracy score is calculated by using the sklearn's `accuracy_score` method between true label `y_true` and predicted label `class_pred`. If the accuracy score exceeds the threshold, the test is marked as passed. The test result is returned along with the accuracy score and the threshold used for the test. **Signs of High Risk**: Signs of high risk within this test present themselves when the model is unable to meet or exceed the specified score threshold. If the model's accuracy score is consistently falling below the set threshold, it indicates a high risk of inaccurate predictions, which can reduce the model's effectiveness and dependability. **Strengths**: The strength of the Minimum Accuracy test lies in its simplicity. It provides a straightforward measure of overall model performance across all classes. It's particularly advantageous when the classes are balanced. The test is also versatile and can be used with both binary and multiclass classification tasks. **Limitations**: This test's limitations surface when dealing with imbalanced datasets. If the classes in the dataset are highly skewed, the accuracy score could be misleading, potentially favoring the majority class and providing a false sense of model performance. Another limitation is it does not provide a measure of the model's precision, recall, or ability to manage false positives and false negatives. It primarily focuses on overall correctness, which might not be sufficient for all types of model analytics.</td>

These coefficients are then compiled into a summary dataframe for all models. Each row in the dataframe corresponds to a model, with a column for each feature's coefficient. Note, this test is only applicable to 'statsmodels' and 'R' models, and will raise a 'SkipTestError' for models from other libraries. **Signs of High Risk**: Instances that might suggest high risk associated with this test include: discrepancies in the way different models weigh features, if any coefficient is unexpectedly high or low, or the test could not be applied to certain models because they are not of the 'statsmodels' or 'R' types. **Strengths**: This test is highly valuable for gaining insight into the training process of different models and for comparing how the models considered the importance of various features.

Beyond this, while the test contrasts the ways various models weigh features, it does not indicate which weighting is most appropriate or accurate, leaving room for interpretation. Lastly, this test does not account for potential overfitting or underfitting of models, and the coefficients it produces might not translate to effective performance on unseen data.</td>

Autocorrelation is the similarity between observations as a function of the time lag between them. It evaluates the independence of residuals in regression types of tasks in Machine Learning. This is essentially a measure to establish the quality of a time-series model, ensuring the error terms in the model do not follow any specific pattern and are random. **Test Mechanism:** The Box-Pierce test calculates a test statistic and a corresponding p-value from the data features. The computed statistical test checks the null hypothesis that the data are independently distributed. This test is implemented by looping over each feature column in the time-series dataset and applying the `acorr_ljungbox` function from the statsmodels library, which returns both the Box-Pierce test statistic and its corresponding p-value. These values are cached as results. **Signs of High Risk:** A low p-value (typically less than 0.05) in the box-pierce test reflects evidence against the null hypothesis suggesting that there are autocorrelations in the dataset, pointing to a potentially high-risk situation in terms of model performance. Additionally, large Box-Pierce test statistic values may signal the presence of autocorrelation. **Strengths:** The Box-Pierce test is beneficial as it aids in detecting patterns or trends in data that are meant to be random, essentially ensuring the absence of autocorrelation. It can be implemented efficiently due to low computational complexity. Moreover, it can be widely applied for most types of regression problems. **Limitations:** This test assumes homoscedasticity and normality of residuals, assumptions which may not always hold true. It may have reduced power for detecting complex autocorrelation schemes, such as higher order or negative correlations. Also, it does not provide specific insights into the nature or patterns of the autocorrelation if detected; it is solely a general test for the existence of autocorrelation. Furthermore, if the time series data has a trend or seasonality, the Box-Pierce test could give misleading results. Lastly, it's worth stressing it's only applicable to time-series data, limiting its overall utility.</td>

It enables the visualization and analysis of the regression model by displaying the set of coefficients derived from the model and their associated 95% confidence intervals. This provides insight into the variability and uncertainty associated with the model's estimates. **Test Mechanism**: The test extracts the estimated coefficients and their associated standard errors from the regression model. Then, it calculates and draws confidence intervals using a 95% confidence level (standard convention in statistics), which provides an indication of the range where the true value can be expected to fall in 95% of the samples. For instance, if the same regression were run multiple times with samples taken from the same population. The process then visualizes these as a bar plot, with predictor variables on the x-axis and their corresponding coefficients on the y-axis, and the calculated upper and lower margins of the confidence intervals being illustrated as error bars. **Signs of High Risk**: If the zero value (indicating no effect) is within the calculated confidence interval, it suggests that that particular feature/coefficient may not significantly contribute to prediction in the model. If multiple coefficients demonstrate this behavior, the overall reliability of the model could be questioned. Additionally, very wide confidence intervals could suggest high uncertainty in the associated coefficient estimates. **Strengths**: This metric provides a straightforward and easily understood visualization of the significance and impact of the individual predictor variables in a regression model. The inclusion of confidence intervals allows for an examination of the uncertainty around each coefficient estimate. **Limitations**: This test is reliant on certain assumptions about the data: it assumes normality of the residuals and independence of observations, which might not be the case in all types of datasets. Additionally, it does not take into account multi-collinearity (correlation between predictor variables), which can distort the model and make interpretation of the coefficients difficult. Finally, this test is only applicable to regression tasks and tabular data sets, and is not suitable for other types of machine learning tasks or data structures.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row33_col2" class="data row33 col2">**Purpose**: The Regression Sensitivity Plot metric is designed to facilitate sensitivity analysis for regression models. It is primarily utilized for examining the outcome change of a system when alterations(shocks) are applied to one variable at a time, keeping all other variables constant. Its core focus is to analyze the effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable in the regression model, and thus aids in identifying critical risk factors in the model that could significantly influence the output. **Test Mechanism**: This test begins by applying shocks of varying magnitudes (as per defined parameters) to each feature of the model, one at a time. A new prediction is then made for each shocked dataset. Since these shocks are applied while keeping all other variables constant, the resulting changes in the model's predictions can be attributed to the shocks. If a transformation parameter is set to "integrate", the initial predictions and target values are transformed using an integration function before being plotted. In the end, a plot of observed values versus predicted values is generated for each model, with a distinct line graph illustrating predictions for each shock. **Signs of High Risk**: If the plot shows drastic changes in model predictions with small shocks to an individual variable, it may be an indication of high risk. This could suggest a high sensitivity of the model to changes in that variable, potentially signaling over-reliance on the variable to make predictions. Unusually high or erratic shifts in the response of the model concerning shocks may also suggest potential model instability or overfitting. **Strengths**: This metric holds the value by enabling the identification of those variables that have a major effect on the model outcomes, thus paving the way towards feature importance understanding. It also generates visual plots, making the results understandable, clear, and interpretable even to non-technical stakeholders. It's beneficial for spotting overfitting and detecting unstable models that too responsive to small changes in variables. **Limitations**: This metric assumes that all other variables remain constant when a shock is applied, which may not always reflect real-world conditions where variables might have complex interdependencies. It is also best suited for linear models and may not always appropriately evaluate the sensitivity of non-linear models. Additionally, it does not provide a numerical measure of risk, it only provides a visual indication, which might be subjective.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row34_col2" class="data row34 col2">**Purpose**: This metric is intended to assess and compare the performance of different regression models. It offers an insightful look into the models' ability to predict dependent variables, both on the data used for training (in-sample) and new data (out-of-sample). Metrics such as R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) are employed. **Test Mechanism**: This test iterates over various regression models supplied as an input list. For each model, it evaluates their in-sample and out-of-sample performance by capturing predictions for the training and test datasets respectively, and comparing these predictions against actual values to calculate R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, and Mean Squared Error (MSE). The models are individually evaluated in this manner, with their results being stored and returned for comparison purposes. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or potential failures in the model's performance might be indicated by excessively large MSE values, or unreasonably low R-squared and Adjusted R-squared values. If the model's performance drastically declines when moving from in-sample to out-of-sample evaluations, this could also signify a high risk of overfitting. **Strengths**: This metric is versatile and allows for the comparison of multiple models at once, providing an objective means of identifying the best-performing model. It provides both in-sample and out-of-sample evaluations, thus informing about the model's performance on unseen data. The use of R-squared and Adjusted R-squared values in addition to MSE provides a comprehensive view of the model's explainability and error rate. **Limitations**: This test presupposes that the regression model's residuals are normally distributed, *i.e.*, a key assumption of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. Thus, it may not appropriately assess models where this assumption is violated. Additionally, it does not account for situations where predictive performance might not directly correlate with higher R-squared or lower MSE values, especially in the event of excessively complex models.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row35_col2" class="data row35 col2">**Purpose**: The Zivot-Andrews Arch metric is used to evaluate the order of integration for a time series data in a machine learning model. It's designed to test for stationarity, a crucial aspect in time series analysis where data points are assumed not to be dependent on time. Stationarity is an indication that the statistical properties such as mean, variance and autocorrelation are all constant over time. **Test Mechanism**: For each feature in the dataset, the Zivot-Andrews unit root test is performed using ZivotAndrews function imported from the arch.unitroot module. It returns the zivot-andrews metric for each feature which consists of the statistical value, p-value (probability value), the number of used lags and the number of observations. The p-value is then later utilized to make a decision on the null hypothesis (unit root exists, series is non-stationary) based on a chosen significance level. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk can be suggested by a high p-value. This could imply that there's an insufficient basis to reject the null hypothesis, which states that the time series has a unit root and is therefore non-stationary. Non-stationary time series data may lead to misleading statistics and unreliable Machine Learning models. **Strengths**: The Zivot-Andrews Arch metric can dynamically test for stationarity against structural breaks in time series data, which provides a robust evaluation of stationarity of features. It becomes very useful in the cases of financial, economic or any time-series data where data observations don't have a consistent pattern, and structural breaks might occur. **Limitations**: The Zivot-Andrews Arch metric test assumes that data under consideration comes from a single-equation, autoregressive model. Thus, it may not be suitable for multivariate time series data or data that doesn't follow the autoregressive model assumption. Additionally, it might not account for sudden shocks or changes in the trend of the time series data which can significantly impact the stationarity of the data.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row36_col2" class="data row36 col2">**Purpose**: The RegressionModelOutsampleComparison test is designed to evaluate the predictive performance of multiple regression models by means of an out-of-sample test. Crucially, the aim of this test is to validate the model's ability to generalize to unseen data, a need that arises from the challenge of overfitting. Two key metrics, Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), are computed for this purpose to provide a quantifiable measure of the model's accuracy on the testing dataset. **Test Mechanism**: To perform this test, multiple models (in the form of Ordinary Least Squares, or OLS regression models) and a test dataset are required as inputs. For each model, predictions are made on the test dataset, following which, the residuals are calculated. These residuals are then used to compute the MSE and RMSE for each model. The outcomes of the test, including the model's descriptive name, its MSE, and RMSE, are stored and outputted in a structured dataframe format. **Signs of High Risk**: High values of MSE or RMSE indicate elevated risk, signifying that the model's predictions significantly deviate from the actual values in the test dataset. Furthermore, persistently significant discrepancies between training and testing performance across various models might suggest an issue with the input data or with the model selection strategies. **Strengths**: This test effectively provides a comparative evaluation of multiple models' out-of-sample performance, enabling the identification of the best performing model. Moreover, by leveraging both MSE and RMSE, one can gain insights about the model's prediction error. While MSE is sensitive to outliers, emphasising larger errors, RMSE (being in the same unit as the dependent variable) provides a more interpretable measurement of average prediction error. **Limitations**: While this test provides valuable insights about model generalization, its applicability is constrained to regression tasks, and specifically OLS models. Furthermore, it assumes that the test dataset is a representative sample of the population that the built model is intended to be generalized to, which might not always be the case. Lastly, the RMSE and MSE might be less meaningful when the dependent variable scale varies significantly, or the residuals' distribution is heavily skewed or contains outliers.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row37_col2" class="data row37 col2">**Purpose:** The purpose of `RegressionModelForecastPlotLevels` is to visually evaluate the performance of a given list of regression models. It does this by plotting the forecasts of these models against the observed data in their training and test datasets. It evaluates the model's ability to produce accurate and reliable forecasts when faced with certain input features. The measure of accuracy here is the proximity of the forecasted values to the actual observed values. In case of any transformations specified, the metric also handles transforming the data before the comparison. **Test Mechanism:** The Python class in consideration accepts `transformation` as a parameter, which defaults to None. First, it checks for the presence of model objects and raises a `ValueError` if none are provided. Next, it loops through each model, generating predictive forecasts for the model's training and testing datasets. These forecasts are then plotted against the actual (observed) values. If a transformation, such as "integrate", is specified, the class carries out the transformation operation (i.e., it performs cumulative sums to create a new series). Finally, plots are created comparing observed and forecasted values for both the original and transformed datasets. **Signs of High Risk:** High risk or failure in the model's performance can be inferred from the generated plots. If the forecasted values deviate significantly from the observed values in either the training or test datasets, it suggests high risk. A significant deviation could be a sign of overfitting or underfitting, which would be a cause for concern. Such discrepancies could limit the model's ability to produce accurate and generalizable results. **Strengths:** - Visual evaluation: The metric provides a graphical way of evaluating the regression models, allowing easier interpretation and assessment of the forecasting accuracy. - Handles multiple models: The metric enables evaluation of multiple models at once, providing a comparative overview of all models. - Handles transformations: Ability to handle transformations such as "integrate" allows for broader scope and flexibility in model evaluations. - Detailed insight: The metric provides a detailed perspective by looking at the performance on both training and testing datasets. **Limitations:** - Visual subjectivity: The metric relies heavily on visual evaluations, and interpretation can vary from person to person. - Limitation in transformations: Currently supports "integrate" transformation only. More complex transformation might not be covered. - Overhead: Plotting for large datasets might be computationally expensive and could increase runtime. - Lack of numerical metrics: While visualization is useful, a corresponding numerical measure to support observations would be beneficial.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row38_col2" class="data row38 col2">**Purpose**: The Logistic Regression Confusion Matrix metric is designed to evaluate the performance of a logistic regression classification model by accounting for true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. By using this confusion matrix, one can visually determine how effectively the model is distinguishing between correct and incorrect classifications. The metric is particularly useful in scenarios where predictions are generated by thresholding probabilities. **Test Mechanism**: This metric makes use of Python's `sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix` function to generate the confusion matrix. Initially, the model's predicted probabilities are adjusted to binary predictions using a provided cut-off threshold, by default set to 0.5. Afterwards, the confusion matrix is constructed using the actual and predicted classes. The confusion matrix is designed in such a way that predicted class labels form the x-axis and actual class labels form the y-axis. Each cell of the matrix contains the count of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives respectively. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or indications of model failure would be suggested by large numbers of false positives and false negatives. This would suggest that the model is incorrectly classifying a substantial number of instances. Also, if the true positive and true negative counts are significantly lower than expected, it can be seen as a high-risk indication. **Strengths**: The Logistic Regression Confusion Matrix is a simple and intuitive way to understand model performance. It not only provides a clear picture of how many instances are correctly and incorrectly classified, but also gives a breakdown of the types of errors. By adjusting the cut-off threshold parameter, users can explore trade-offs between precision (minimizing false positives) and recall (minimizing false negatives), making it flexible and adaptable for various prediction scenarios. **Limitations**: Despite its simplicity and clarity, the confusion matrix has its limitations. For imbalanced datasets, confusion matrix might give misleading results. For instance, a model might have a high accuracy by predicting majority classes, yet perform poorly on minority classes. It also does not give any insight into the severity of the mistakes and the cost trade-off between different kinds of misclassifications. Lastly, the choice of the cut-off threshold can significantly impact the interpretation, and an improperly chosen threshold may lead to flawed conclusions.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row39_col2" class="data row39 col2">**Purpose**: The Probability of Default (PD) Rating Class Plot is used to understand the distribution of default probabilities across different rating classes. This test is critical in inferring credit risk, as it shows the likelihood of default for different rating classes based on the predictions made by the model. The test is designed to visualize how effectively the model is able to differentiate between different risk levels in the credit data set. **Test Mechanism**: This visualization metric classifies predicted probabilities of defaults into user-defined rating classes (defined in "rating_classes" in default parameters), performs a calculation of average default rate within each rating class, and then generates bar plots for each rating class. The generated bar plots aim to illustrate the average probability of default within each class, for both the training and testing data sets. The classification of predicted probabilities is performed using the pandas "cut" function, which segments and sorts the data values into bins. **Signs of High Risk**: If the bar plots show that lower rating classes have higher average probabilities of default than higher rating classes, or there is little differentiation between the averages across rating classes, this indicates high risk in the model's ability to accurately predict default levels. Also, a model that produces a vast difference between probabilities for the training and testing set may indicate overfitting, which is also a sign of high risk. **Strengths**: The strength of this metric lies in its ability to visually represent the effectiveness of the model in predicting credit default risk across different risk levels, allowing for easy interpretation. By visualizing the model's effectiveness for each rating class separately, it allows the analyst to quickly identify where the model is struggling. The inclusion of both training and testing data sets helps to quickly highlight issues of overfitting. **Limitations**: The main limitation of this metric comes from predetermining the number of rating classes. Incorrect choices could either oversimplify or overcomplicate the picture of default rates. The metric relies heavily on the assumptions that the rating classes effectively separate different risk levels and that the defined boundaries between rating classes accurately represent the true risk distribution. Furthermore, the tests don't account for class imbalance in the data set that could skew the average probabilities. This metric alone cannot be used for determining the overall performance of the model, and should be used in combination with other evaluation metrics.</td>

The metric is primarily designed to analyze how the model's scoring decision aligns with actual outcomes of credit loan applications. In addition, it helps identify potential discrepancies between model predictions and real-world risk levels. **Test Mechanism**: This model-specific metric uses the provided training and test datasets to generate a histogram of credit scores for both default (negative class) and non-default (positive class) instances. It works by calculating the credit score for each instance in the dataset using a logistic regression model's scorecard method which takes into account the contributions of different features to the odds of being a default. It uses a default point to odds (PDO) scaling factor and predefined target score and odds settings. The score distribution is calculated and plotted separately for the training and test sets to facilitate insights into how well the model generalizes to unseen data. **Signs of High Risk**: Indications of potential risk or performance issues in relation to this metric include significant discrepancies between the distributions of training and testing data, skewed distributions favoring a particular score or class, or an abnormal distribution of scores that does not align with expected real-world patterns. If positive and negative classes tend to have similar scores or their distributions overlap significantly, it might suggest the model is not effective at differentiating between the classes. **Strengths**: The Scorecard Histogram metric is useful for visually interpreting the credit scoring system of a machine learning model and can provide a greater understanding of model behavior. It allows for direct comparison of actual and predicted scores for both training and testing data, and provides a way to intuitively visualize model's ability to differentiate between positive and negative classes. It also aids in uncovering patterns or anomalies that might not be evident from numerical metrics alone. **Limitations**: Although valuable for visual interpretation, this method doesn't quantify model's performance, and hence might lack precision when it comes to complete model evaluation. It is also susceptible to the quality of the input data—undue bias or noise in the data will impact both the score calculation and resultant histogram. Additionally, the test is specific to credit scoring models, which limits its usefulness across a broader range of machine learning tasks and models. Finally, the efficacy of the metric is somewhat tied to subjective interpretation, as it relies on the analyst's assessment of the plot's characteristics and implications.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row41_col2" class="data row41 col2">**Purpose**: The 'FeatureImportanceAndSignificance' test in the given script aims to calculate the importance and statistical significance of features within the model's context. It achieves this by comparing the p-values from a regression model and the feature importances from a decision tree model. This test aids in feature selection during the model development process by identifying the most significant variables. **Test Mechanism**: During this test, an initial comparison is made between the p-values from a regression model and the importance of features from a decision tree model. Both the p-values and feature importances are then normalized to ensure uniform comparison. The 'p_threshold' parameter is used to determine what p-value is considered statistically significant. If 'significant_only' parameter is true, features with p-values below the threshold will be included in the final output. The output includes interactive plots displaying Normalized p-values and the corresponding Normalized Feature Importance. Errors are thrown if two models aren't provided (one regression and one decision tree). **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or warning signs in the context of this test might include very high or very low p-values that stand out, suggesting a feature might not be meaningful. The risk may also exist if many unimportant variables (with low feature importance) have significant p-values, which might indicate that the model is possibly overfitted. **Strengths**: It is an excellent test for feature selection mechanisms as it combines two perspectives: statistical significance through p-values and feature importance using a machine learning model (decision tree). Additionally, it includes an interactive visualization, facilitating comprehension of the results easily. **Limitations**: This test only accepts two models - a regression model and a decision tree. Therefore, its application may be limited if other model types are used. Furthermore, the test might not account for potential correlative or causative relationships between the input features, which potentially can lead to inaccurate importance and significance readings. Lastly, it heavily relies on the p-value as a cut-off for feature significance, which critics argue can be arbitrary and might not reflect the true significance of the feature.</td>

In the context of a machine learning model, this test is primarily used to evaluate data utilized in regression tasks, especially those involving time series and forecasting. **Test Mechanism**: The test operates by iterating over each feature within the training dataset and applying the `acorr_ljungbox` function from the `statsmodels.stats.diagnostic` library. This function calculates the Ljung-Box statistic and p-value for each feature. These results are then stored in a dictionary where the keys are the feature names and the values are dictionaries containing the statistic and p-value respectively. Generally, a lower p-value indicates a higher likelihood of significant autocorrelations within the feature. **Signs of High Risk**: A high risk or failure in the model's performance relating to this test might be indicated by high Ljung-Box statistic values or low p-values. These outcomes suggest the presence of significant autocorrelations in the respective features, which, if not properly considered or handled in the machine learning model, can negatively affect model performance or bias. **Strengths**: The Ljung-Box test is a powerful tool for detecting autocorrelations within datasets, especially in time series data. It provides quantitative measures (statistic and p-value) that allow for precise evaluation of autocorrelation and can be instrumental in avoiding issues related to autoregressive residuals and other challenges in regression models. **Limitations**: Despite its utility, the Ljung-Box test is not without its limitations. For instance, it cannot detect all types of non-linearity or complex interrelationships among variables. Additionally, testing individual features may not fully encapsulate the dynamics of the data if features interact with each other. Lastly, it is designed more for traditional statistical models and may not be fully compatible with certain types of complex machine learning models.</td>

This serves to analyze the performance of a logistic regression model, especially one related to credit risk prediction. **Test Mechanism**: The operation of this test involves the extraction of the target column from the train and test datasets, followed by the calculation of probabilities using the model's predict function. These probabilities are added as a new column to the training and testing dataframes. The histograms are generated by extracting subsets from these dataframes according to the target column and actual classes they represent (0 or 1 for binary classification scenarios), with different opacities set for better visualization. The four histograms (two for training data, two for test data) are overlaid on two subplot frames (one for training, one for testing), and the result is returned as a plotly graph object. **Signs of High Risk**: The possibility of high risk or failure in the model's performance arises if the histograms show significant discrepancies between the training and testing data, or between the positive and negative classes. These discrepancies could indicate overfitting or potential bias in the model. Additionally, if the probabilities are distributed unevenly, it may suggest that the model is not accurately predicting outcomes. **Strengths**: This test offers numerous strengths. First, it provides a visual representation of the PD generated by a machine learning model, which helps analyze and understand the model's behavior. Second, it can assess both the training and testing datasets, adding layers of validation to the model. Third, it highlights the disparity between multiple classes, offering potential insights into class imbalance or data skewness. Lastly, in the context of credit risk prediction, it is especially beneficial for visualizing the spread of risk across different classes. **Limitations**: Despite its strengths, the Logistic Regression Prediction Histogram has a few limitations. First, it is specifically tailored for binary classification scenarios, where the target variable only has two classes - making it inappropriate for multi-class classification tasks. Second, it is applicable mostly for logistic regression models and might not be as effective or accurate for testing other model types. Finally, while it gives a good visual representation of the model's PD predictions, it does not provide a quantifiable measure or score for model performance.</td>

This is essential in understanding the distribution and behavior of the model's features, as numerous statistical methods assume normal distribution of the data. **Test Mechanism**: The test mechanism involves computing the Jarque-Bera statistic and the associated p-value, skew and kurtosis for each feature in the dataset. Necessary variables like the Jarque-Bera statistic, p-value, skew and kurtosis are computed using the 'jarque_bera' function from the 'statsmodels' library in python and stored in a dictionary. The jarque_bera function evaluates the skewness and kurtosis of the input dataset to determine if it follows a normal distribution. A significant p-value (usually less than 0.05) suggests that the feature does not possess normal distribution. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk associated with this test would be a significantly high Jarque-Bera statistic and a low p-value (typically &lt; 0.05). These indicate that the data deviates significantly from a normal distribution, thereby implying that a machine learning model may not function as intended as many models expect feature data to be normally distributed. **Strengths**: The strength of this test lies in its ability to provide insights into the shape of the data distribution. It helps determine whether a given set of data follows a normal distribution or not, enabling risk assessment, especially for models that assume normal distribution of data. By measuring skewness and kurtosis, it also provides extra insights on the nature and magnitude of distribution deviation. **Limitations**: The Jarque-Bera test only checks for normality of the data distribution and will not provide insights about other types of distributions. Datasets which are not normally distributed but may follow some other distribution, may lead to incorrect risk assessments. Additionally, this test is very sensitive to large sample sizes, often rejecting the null hypothesis (that data is normally distributed) for even slight deviations in larger datasets.</td>

When applied to machine learning models, it helps in forecasting and understanding the stochastic behavior of data. In sense, it is used to ensure the robustness of the results and make valid predictions out of regression analysis models. **Test Mechanism**: The PP test is applied to each feature present in the dataset. A data frame is acquired from the dataset and for each column in this data frame, the PhillipsPerron method is used to calculate its statistic value, p-value, used lags and number of observations. This method is calculating the PP metric for each feature and caching the results. **Signs of High Risk**: Indicators of high risk related to this metric could include: - High P-value, which might suggest that the series has a unit root and thus is non-stationary. - Test statistic values that exceed the critical values, providing further evidence of non-stationarity. - If the 'usedlag' value is high for a series, there may be autocorrelation issues which can further complicate model performance. **Strengths**: The strengths of the PP test are as follows: - It is robust against heteroskedasticity in the error term. - It examines relatively long time series. - It helps to identify if the time series is stationary or not, which affects the selection of appropriate models for forecasting. **Limitations**: However, the PP test has some limitations: - It can only be utilized in a univariate time series framework. - The PP test does rely on asymptotic theory, therefore, for small sample sizes the power of the test can substantially reduce. - Non-stationary time series might require differencing to convert them into stationary series, which might lead to loss of important data points.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row46_col2" class="data row46 col2">**Purpose**: The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test featured in this metric is aimed at evaluating the distribution of a dataset's features. Particularly, it assesses whether each feature's data follows a normal distribution, which is a crucial assumption in many statistical methods and machine learning models. **Test Mechanism**: The KS test implemented here computes the KS statistic and the corresponding p-value for each column in a dataset. These values are determined by comparing the cumulative distribution function of the dataset's feature with a theoretical normal distribution. A feature-wise KS statistic and p-value are then stored in a dictionary. The threshold p-value, below which the null hypothesis (that the data comes from a normal distribution) can be rejected, is not explicitly set in this implementation and can be defined in accordance with the specific application. **Signs of High Risk**: A higher KS statistic for a feature and a low p-value would suggest a significant discrepancy between that feature's distribution and a normal distribution. Features with substantial deviations might cause problems if the model in use assumes a normal distribution of data, hence pose a risk. **Strengths**: The KS test is sensitive to differences in both the location and shape of the empirical cumulative distribution functions of two samples. It's non-parametric and doesn't assume any specific distribution for the data, making it versatile for various datasets. Being a feature-oriented test, it provides granular insights about the data distribution. **Limitations**: The KS test may be overly sensitive to deviations in the tails of the data distribution, potentially flagging them as non-normal even in cases where these deviations are not necessarily a concern for the model. Moreover, the test could become less powerful with multivariate distributions since it's primarily used for univariate distributions. Also, as it's a goodness-of-fit test, it does not point out specific forms of non-normality such as skewness or kurtosis that could be relevant for model fitting.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row47_col2" class="data row47 col2">**Purpose**: The main purpose of this metric is to visualize and analyze the residuals (the differences between the observed and predicted values) of a regression problem. It allows for a graphical exploration of the model's errors, helping to identify statistical patterns or anomalies that may indicate a systematic bias in the model's predictions. By inspecting the residuals, we can check how well the model fits the data and meets the assumptions of the model. **Test Mechanism**: The metric generates four common types of residual plots which are: a histogram with kernel density estimation, a quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot, a residuals series dot plot, and an autocorrelation function (ACF) plot. - The residuals histogram with kernel density estimation visualizes the distribution of residuals and allows to check if they are normally distributed. - Q-Q plot compares the observed quantiles of the data to the quantiles of a standard normal distribution, helping to assess the normality of residuals. - A residuals dot plot indicates the variation in residuals over time, which helps in identifying any time-related pattern in residuals. - ACF plot visualizes the correlation of an observation with its previous observations, helping to pinpoint any seasonality effect within residuals. **Signs of High Risk**: - Skewness or asymmetry in the histogram or a significant deviation from the straight line in the Q-Q plot, which indicates that the residuals aren't normally distributed. - Large spikes in the ACF plot, indicating that the residuals are correlated, in violation of the assumption that they are independent. - Non-random patterns in the dot plot of residuals, indicating potential model misspecification. **Strengths**: - Visual analysis of residuals is a powerful yet simple way to understand a model’s behavior across the data set and to identify problems with the model's assumptions or its fit to the data. - The test is applicable to any regression model, irrespective of complexity. - By exploring residuals, we might uncover relationships that were not captured by the model, revealing opportunities for model improvement. **Limitations**: - Visual tests are largely subjective and can be open to interpretation. Clear-cut decisions about the model based solely on these plots may not be possible. - The metrics from the test do not directly infer the action based on the results; domain-specific knowledge and expert judgement is often required to interpret the results. - These plots can indicate a problem with the model but they do not necessarily reveal the nature or cause of the problem. - The test assumes that the error terms are identically distributed, which might not always be the case in real-world scenarios.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row48_col2" class="data row48 col2">**Purpose**: The Shapiro-Wilk metric is used to assess if a given set of data adheres to the standard normal distribution. This is integral in machine learning modeling as the normality of data can significantly affect model performance. In particular, it is used on different features of the dataset in both classification and regression tasks. **Test Mechanism**: By implementing the Shapiro-Wilk test for each feature column in the training dataset, we determine if the data in these columns conform to the normal distribution. The test returns a statistic and a p-value, where the p-value is used to decipher whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis (the data being tested is normally distributed). **Signs of High Risk**: A lower p-value, typically below 0.05, indicates a high risk as it rejects the null hypothesis, meaning that the data is not normally distributed. For ML models that assume normality of data, this could lead to poor performance or inaccurate predictions. **Strengths**: The Shapiro-Wilk test is known for its precision, making it especially useful on small to moderate-sized datasets. It also works on both classification and regression tasks, providing more versatility in its usage. Since it tests each feature column separately, it can give an alert if any particular feature does not conform to normality. **Limitations**: Since Shapiro-Wilk test is quite sensitive, it often rejects the null hypothesis (i.e., data is normally distributed) even for slight deviations, particularly for large datasets. This means the test can consider data as non-normal even if it's approximately normally distributed, potentially leading to 'false alarms' of high risk. Additionally, handling of missing data or outliers needs to be carefully managed before testing as these can highly influence the results. Lastly, it is not ideally suited for data with strong skewness or kurtosis.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row49_col2" class="data row49 col2">**Purpose**: The 'Scorecard Bucket Histogram' is employed as a metric to evaluate the performance of a classification model, specifically in credit risk assessment. It categorizes model scores into different rating classes, and visualizes the distribution of scores or probabilities within each class. It essentially measures how different risk categories (classes) are distributed in the model scores and provides an insight into the model's classification ability, making it particularly useful in credit scoring and risk modelling where understanding probability of default is critical. **Test Mechanism**: The test works by computing the probabilities for each record in the test and train dataset using the model's predict function. Subsequently, it calculates the scores using a predefined formula incorporating target score, target odds, and points to double odds (PDO). The scores are then bucketed into pre-defined rating classes (such as 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D') and plotted in a histogram for both the train and test datasets. The target score, target odds, points to double the odds (PDO), and rating classes are all customizable parameters, thus allowing for flexibility in test metrics based on differing model or industry norms. **Signs of High Risk**: Indicators of high risk or failure in relation to this metric might include disproportionate scores within rating classes, excessive overlap between classes, or an inconsistent distribution of scores between the training and testing datasets. If the model is accurately classifying and risk is being evenly distributed, we'd anticipate smooth and relatively balanced histograms within classes. **Strengths**: The strengths of this metric lie in its form of output, it provides a quick visual snap of score distribution; it breaks down complex predictions into simple, understandable classes making it easily interpretable for both technical and business audiences. Also, this metric caters to customization of parameters, but most importantly it gives ownership of the class definitions to the user. It is quite useful in the field of credit risk, giving a clear understanding of which class or 'Bucket' a potential borrower belongs to. **Limitations**: One limitation of this metric is its reliance on manual setting of classes and other parameters (like target score, target odds, and PDO), which may lead to arbitrary classifications if not judiciously performed and could potentially introduce biases. Additionally, its effectiveness can be limited if used on non-tabular data. Furthermore, it does not provide a numerical value which can be easily compared across different models or runs, since the output is primarily visual. Consequently, it may not present the complete view of model performance, and should be used in conjunction with other metrics.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row50_col2" class="data row50 col2">**Purpose**: The purpose of this test metric, RegressionModelInsampleComparison, is to assess the performance of regression models on the same dataset that they were trained on. The performance of the models is compared against each other to identify which fits the data best. Evaluation metrics include goodness-of-fit statistics such as R-Squared, Adjusted R-Squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). **Test Mechanism**: The test's implementation involves the following steps; - First, a check is done to ensure that the list of models is not empty. - After confirmation, the In-Sample performance of the models is computed by using a private function `_in_sample_performance_ols`. This function: - Loops through each model in the list - For each model, it extracts the features (`X`) and target (`y_true`) from the training dataset and then predicts target values (`y_pred`) - The model's performance metrics are then computed using formulas for R-Squared, Adjusted R-Squared, MSE and RMSE. - The computed metrics, variables of the model and the model's identifier are saved in a dictionary and appended to a list. - The collected results are then saved and returned in form of a pandas dataframe. **Signs of High Risk**: A high risk or failure of the model's performance can be indicated by waiting significantly low values for R-Squared or Adjusted R-Squared and significantly high values for MSE and RMSE. The exact thresholds may vary based on the specific context or domain in which the model is being applied. **Strengths**: - Enables direct comparison of different models' in-sample performance on the same data set, providing a clear picture of which model is better suited to the data. - It computes multiple evaluation methods (R-Squared, Adjusted R-Squared, MSE, RMSE), which provides a comprehensive overview of the model's performance. **Limitations**: - This test only uses in-sample performance, i.e., how well a model fits the data it was trained on. It might not indicate how the model performs on unseen or out-of-sample data, which is a core aspect of modeling tasks. - It might be sensitive to overfitting as better in-sample performance might be a result of the model merely memorizing the training data. - It does not take into account other crucial factors like data's pattern of changes over time, also known as temporal dynamics. - The test doesn't offer a mechanism to automatically determine whether reported metrics are acceptable - human/judgement-based interpretation is needed.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row51_col2" class="data row51 col2">**Purpose**: The Regression Feature Significance metric assesses the significance of each feature in a given set of regression models. It creates a visualization displaying p-values for every feature of each model, assisting model developers in understanding which features are most influential in their models. **Test Mechanism**: The test mechanism involves going through each fitted regression model in a given list, extracting the model coefficients and p-values for each feature, and then plotting these values. The x-axis on the plot contains the p-values while the y-axis denotes the coefficients of each feature. A vertical red line is drawn at the threshold for p-value significance, which is 0.05 by default. Any features with p-values to the left of this line are considered statistically significant at the chosen level. **Signs of High Risk**: Any feature with a high p-value (greater than the threshold) is considered a potential high risk, as it suggests the feature is not statistically significant and may not be reliably contributing to the model's predictions. A high number of such features may indicate problems with the model validation, variable selection, and overall reliability of the model predictions. **Strengths**: 1. Helps identify the features that significantly contribute to a model's prediction, providing insights into the feature importance. 2. Provides tangible, easy-to-understand visualizations to interpret the feature significance. 3. Facilitates comparison of feature importance across multiple models. **Limitations**: 1. This metric assumes model features are independent, which may not always be the case. Multicollinearity (high correlation amongst predictors) can cause high variance and unreliable statistical tests of significance. 2. The p-value strategy for feature selection doesn't take into account the magnitude of the effect, focusing solely on whether the feature is likely non-zero. 3. This test is specific to regression models and wouldn't be suitable for other types of ML models. 4. P-value thresholds are somewhat arbitrary and do not always indicate practical significance, only statistical significance.</td>

It measures the quality of the model using classic regression metrics such as R-Squared, Adjusted R-Squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). **Test Mechanism**: This test utilizes the 'train_ds' attribute of the model to collect and assess the training data. It first retrieves the independent variables and uses the model to predict on the given features. The test calculates several standard regression performance metrics including R-Square, Adjusted R-Squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics quantify how close the predicted responses are to the true responses. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or potentially problematic model performance could be indicated by low R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squared values, or high MSE and RMSE values. Low R-squared and adjusted R-squared values suggest a poor fit between the model predictions and the true responses, indicating the model explains a small portion of the variance in the target variable. High MSE or RMSE represents a high prediction error, which points to poor model performance. **Strengths**: This test offers an extensive evaluation of regression models as it combines four key measures of model accuracy and fit, offering a comprehensive view of the model's performance. Furthermore, both the R-Squared and the Adjusted R-Squared measures are readily interpretable, representing the proportion of total variation in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables. **Limitations**: This test only applies to regression models and cannot be used to evaluate binary classification models or time series models, limiting its scope. Furthermore, while RMSE and MSE are good measures of prediction error, they can be sensitive to outliers, which might lead to an overestimation of the model's prediction error. Lastly, high R-squared or adjusted R-squared doesn't necessarily imply a good model, especially in cases where the model is overfitting the data.</td>

It is used on time-series data specifically, to establish the order of integration, which in turn helps in providing accurate forecasting. The baseline condition for any time series model is that the series should be stationary. **Test Mechanism**: Given a dataset, this metric calculates the KPSS score for each feature in the dataset. Each KPSS score consists of a statistic, a p-value, a used lag, and critical values. The KPSS score calculates the hypothesis that an observable time series is stationary around a deterministic trend. If the calculated statistic is greater than the critical value, the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating that the series is not stationary. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk in relation to this metric would be signified by a high KPSS score, specifically if the calculated statistic is greater than the critical value. This implies that the null hypothesis is rejected and the series is not stationary, making the model ineffective for forecasting. **Strengths**: The KPSS test has several advantages. It assesses directly the stationarity of a series, which is the basic condition of many time-series models and is therefore a crucial step in model validation. Furthermore, the underlying intuition of the test is intuitive and straightforward, making it easily understandable for developers and risk management teams. **Limitations**: Despite its strengths, KPSS does have some limitations. The test assumes the absence of a unit root in the series and does not differentiate between series that are stationary and series that are near-stationary. The test may also have limited power against certain alternatives, and the validity of the test depends on the number of lags chosen.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row54_col2" class="data row54 col2">**Purpose**: The Lilliefors test, named after the Swedish statistician Hubert Lilliefors, is used in this context to determine whether the features of the machine learning model's training dataset follow a normal distribution. Normality of distribution is a critical assumption in many statistical procedures and machine learning models. If the features do not follow a normal distribution, certain types of models may not function optimally, potentially leading to inaccurate predictions. **Test Mechanism**: The test is applied to every feature column in the training dataset. For each feature, the Lilliefors test computes a test statistic and a p-value. The test statistic quantifies how far the distribution of the feature is from a perfect normal distribution, while the p-value provides a measure of the statistical significance of this deviation. The results are stored in a dictionary where keys are feature column names, and values are another dictionary containing the test statistic and p-value. **Signs of High Risk**: If the p-value for a feature is less than a predetermined significance level (typically 0.05), this would indicate that the distribution of the feature significantly deviates from a normal distribution. This suggests a high risk as models assuming normality may not work accurately or efficiently with such a feature. **Strengths**: This Lilliefors test is particularly useful because it does not require the mean and variance of the normal distribution to be known in advance, making it a robust choice for real-world data where these values are often unknown. The test is capable of screening every feature column, providing a comprehensive view of the dataset. **Limitations**: While the Lilliefors test is a practical tool to gauge normality, it has a few limitations. It can only test one-dimensional data, so it is not suited for datasets with interactions between features or multi-dimensional phenomena. Additionally, the test may have lower power compared to other tests (like Anderson-Darling test) which means it's slightly less sensitive at detecting departures from normality. Finally, like any statistical test, it can yield false positives or negatives, so relying on it alone without considering other characteristics of the data could be risky.</td>

It's purpose is not only to measure the performance of the model but also to visually assess the behavior of the model by plotting the cumulative probabilities for positive and negative classes across the training and test datasets. **Test Mechanism**: To test the logistic regression model, the metric computes the predicted probabilities for each instance in training and test datasets and adds it as a new column in these sets. The cumulative probabilities for positive and negative classes are then calculated and sorted in ascending order. Subsequently, cumulative distributions of these probabilities are created for both positive and negative classes across both training and test datasets. The cumulative probabilities are presented visually in a plot. The plot has two subplots - one for the training data and the other for the test data, with lines representing cumulative distributions of positive and negative classes. **Signs of High Risk**: Indicators of high risk include: 1. Imbalanced distribution of probabilities for either positive or negative classes. 2. Inconsistencies or significant differences between the cumulative probability distributions for the training data versus the test data. 3. Inconsistencies or significant differences between the cumulative probability distributions for positive and negative classes. **Strengths**: Some major merits of using this metric are: 1. It not only returns numerical probabilities but also provides a visual representation of data which makes it easier to understand and interpret the model's behavior. 2. It allows for comparison of model's behavior across training and testing datasets, which can provide insights into how well the model is generalized. 3. It also distinguishes between positive and negative classes and their respective distribution patterns which can aid in problem diagnosis. **Limitations**: Despite its strengths, this metric also has few limitations: 1. It only applies to classification tasks and specifically to logistic regression models. 2. The graphical results require human interpretation and may not be directly applicable for automated risk detection. 3. The method does not provide a single quantifiable measure of model risk, but rather a visual representation and broad distributional information. 4. If the training and test datasets are not representative of the overall data distribution, the metric could provide misleading results.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row56_col2" class="data row56 col2">**Purpose**: The Runs Test is a statistical procedure used to determine whether the sequence of data extracted from the ML model behaves randomly or not. Specifically, it analyzes runs, sequences of consecutive positives or negatives, in the data to check if there are more or fewer runs than expected under the assumption of randomness. This can be an indication of some pattern, trend, or cycle in the model's output which may need attention. **Test Mechanism**: The testing mechanism applies the Runs Test from the statsmodels module on each column of the training dataset. For every feature in the dataset, a Runs Test is executed, whose output includes a Runs Statistic and P-value. A low P-value suggests that data arrangement in the feature is not likely to be random. The results are stored in a dictionary where the keys are the feature names, and the values are another dictionary storing the test statistic and the P-value for each feature. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk is indicated when the P-value is close to zero. If the p-value is less than a predefined significance level (like 0.05), it suggests that the runs (series of positive or negative values) in the model's output are not random and are longer or shorter than what is expected under a random scenario. This would mean there's a high risk of non-random distribution of errors or model outcomes, suggesting potential issues with the model. **Strengths**: The strength of the Runs Test is that it's straightforward and fast for detecting non-random patterns in data sequence. It can validate assumptions of randomness, which is particularly valuable for checking error distributions in regression models, trendless time series data, and making sure a classifier doesn't favour one class over another. Moreover, it can be applied to both classification and regression tasks, making it versatile. **Limitations**: The test assumes that the data is independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.), which might not be the case for many real-world datasets. The conclusion drawn from the low p-value indicating non-randomness does not provide information about the type or the source of the detected pattern. Also, it is sensitive to extreme values (outliers), and overly large or small run sequences can influence the results. Furthermore, this test does not provide model performance evaluation; it is used to detect patterns in the sequence of outputs only.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row57_col2" class="data row57 col2">**Purpose**: This metric, referred to as the Scorecard Probabilities Histogram, is used to visualise and evaluate the risk classification of a model especially designed for the credit risk domain. It does this by examining the distribution of the probability of default across different score buckets. The score buckets are categories in which entities (like loan applicants) are placed based on their predicted default risk. Specifically, this metric is used to ensure the model correctly classifies entities into the appropriate risk categories (score buckets) and also properly represents their default probabilities. **Test Mechanism**: The Scorecard Probabilities Histogram first calculates default probabilities using the 'compute_probabilities' method where the output probability is added as a new column to the input dataset. Next, scores are computed using these probabilities, a target score, target odds and Points to Double the odds (pdo) factor in the 'compute_scores' method. These scores are further processed into buckets using the 'compute_buckets' method. Once data is bucketed, a histogram is plotted for each score bucket. This histogram takes the probabilities of default serious as the x-axis and their frequency as the y-axis using the 'plot_probabilities_histogram' method. The process is run separately for both training and testing data. **Signs of High Risk**: If there is a significant overlap of different score buckets in the histogram, this can indicate that the model is not effectively distinguishing between different risk categories. Additionally, if extremely high or low probabilities are common across all buckets, there may be a skew in the model's predictions. **Strengths**: The Scorecard Probabilities Histogram is an advantageous tool for observing and analysing the predicted default risk distribution across different risk categories. This metric allows us to visually inspect the model's performance and its calibration for different risk categories. Moreover, it also provides a mechanism to visualize how these classifications are distributed on the training and testing datasets separately which is beneficial for understanding model generalization. **Limitations**: The Scorecard Probabilities Histogram does have limitations. For one, it assumes that the risk categories are linear and equally spaced, which may not always be the case. Secondly, the visualization may not provide adequate information if there are too few or too many score buckets. Lastly, while this metric effectively visualizes the distribution of probabilities, it provides no concrete numerical metric or threshold to definitively gauge the model's performance. For a more precise evaluation, it should be used in combination with other metrics and tools such as confusion matrix, AUC-ROC, Precision, Recall etc.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row58_col2" class="data row58 col2">**Purpose**: The purpose of the Dickey-Fuller GLS (DFGLS) Arch metric is to establish the order of integration of time series data. In machine learning models that deal with time series and forecasting, this metric checks for the presence of a unit root i.e., it tests whether a time series is non-stationary, which is an integral first step in such analyses. **Test Mechanism**: In this code, the Dickey-Fuller GLS unit root test is employed on each feature of the dataset. In other words, it iterates over every individual column of the dataset and applies the DFGLS test to evaluate and report on the presence of a unit root. This information is then stored as output values such as 'stat' for the test statistic, 'pvalue' for the p-value, 'usedlag' for the number of lagged differences used in the regression and 'nobs' for the number of observations. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk in this context would be determined by a high p-value. If the p-value for the DFGLS test is high (e.g., a common threshold is above 0.05), this indicates that the time series data is likely non-stationary, and thus poses a risk for generating unreliable forecasts or analyses. **Strengths**: The Dickey-Fuller GLS is a powerful technique to check the stationarity of times series data. It helps in confirming that the assumptions of the models are met before the actual building of the machine learning models can take place. The results given by this metric provides a clear perspective on whether the data is suitable for certain machine learning models, mainly those that require time-series to be stationary. **Limitations**: Despite its advantages, the DFGLS test also has some limitations. It can lead to incorrect conclusions if the time series has a structural break, or if the time series follows a trend but is otherwise stationary (in which case detrending might be necessary). Also, it doesn't work well with shorter time series data or with volatile data.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row59_col2" class="data row59 col2">**Purpose**: This validation test is designed to evaluate and rank ARIMA models, which are popular forecasting models used, amongst other things, for time series prediction tasks. The script automatically fits multiple ARIMA models (with varying orders of differencing, autoregression, and moving average parameters) for each variable in the provided dataset. It then ranks them based on their Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values. This allows efficient selection of the most suitable model for forecasting, based on these standard statistical measures. **Test Mechanism**: The metric works by generating a range of possible combinations of ARIMA model parameters within a predefined limit (max_p, max_d, max_q representing autoregressive, differencing, and moving average components respectively). It fits all these models on the provided time-series data. For each ARIMA model, it calculates and records the BIC and AIC value, which serve as performance measures for the model fit. Furthermore, prior to the parameter fitting, it runs an Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity on the series. If the series isn't stationary, it sends out a warning, as ARIMA models require the input series to be stationary. **Signs of High Risk**: If the p-value of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for any variable is greater than 0.05, a warning is logged indicating that the series might not be stationary, and this can lead to inaccurate results. Secondly, if there is consistent failure in fitting ARIMA models (evident through logged errors), it might indicate issues with the data or model stability. **Strengths**: This mechanism streamlines the potentially complex task of selecting the most suitable ARIMA model based on BIC and AIC criteria. It checks for and warns about non-stationarity in the data, a crucial assumption for ARIMA models. The exhaustive approach in checking all possible combinations of model parameters maximizes the potential for finding the best-fit model. **Limitations**: The approach can be computationally expensive given that it creates and fits multiple ARIMA models per variable. Secondly, a high p-value in the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test indicates a lack of stationarity, but it doesn't make any transformations on the data to rectify this. Additionally, model selection is purely based on BIC and AIC criteria, which might not yield the best predictive model in all scenarios.

<td id="T_9d30f_row60_col2" class="data row60 col2">**Purpose**: The purpose of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) metric test is to test the null hypothesis that a unit root is present in a time series. In other words, the ADF test aims to check the stationarity of a given time-series dataset. It plays a crucial role in the phases of time series analysis, regression tasks, and forecasting, as these techniques often require the data to be stationary. **Test Mechanism**: The ADF test applies the Python “statsmodels” library's function "adfuller" to each column of the training dataset. By doing so, it calculates the ADF statistic, p-value, the number of lags used, and the number of observations in the sample for each column. If the p-value for a column is smaller than the predefined threshold (typically 0.05), then it is considered as having passed the test, thus concluding that the series is stationary. **Signs of High Risk**: If the p-value exceeds the threshold value, the test for that column is considered as failed, which indicates a high risk or potential model performance issue. A high p-value implies that the null hypothesis (indicating a unit root) cannot be rejected, meaning that the series is non-stationary and may cause unreliable and spurious results in the model's performance and forecast. **Strengths**: The ADF test holds several key advantages: 1. Test for stationarity: The ADF test provides a rigorous mechanism for testing the stationarity of time series data, which is critical for many machine learning and statistical models. 2. Comprehensive output: The function provides rich output, including the number of lags used and the number of observations, which can be useful for understanding the behavior of the series. **Limitations**: However, the ADF test also presents some limitations: 1. Dependence on threshold: The result of the test is highly dependent on the threshold chosen. An inappropriate threshold may lead to incorrect rejection or acceptance of the null hypothesis. 2. Inefficient for trending data: The ADF test assumes no deterministic trend in the data. If a deterministic trend exists, the test may identify a stationary series as non-stationary. 3. May lead to false positive: Particularly for larger datasets, the ADF test tends to reject the null hypothesis (indicating a unit root), which can lead to a high propensity for false positives.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row61_col2" class="data row61 col2">**Purpose**: This metric 'GINITable' is used to calculate and display the AUC (Area under the ROC Curve), GINI coefficient, and KS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) statistic for both training and testing datasets. These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of a classification model and quantify its discriminatory power, i.e., its ability to distinguish between different classes. **Test Mechanism**: A dict is created to store performance metrics for both training and testing datasets. The algorithm loops over these datasets and computes the metrics for each. The Area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) Curve (AUC) is calculated by invoking the compute_auc method, which uses the roc_auc_score function from Scikit-Learn. The GINI coefficient, a measure of statistical dispersion, is computed by doubling the AUC and subtracting 1. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic is computed using the roc_curve function of Scikit-Learn, subtracting False Positive Rate (FPR) from True Positive Rate (TPR), and then finding the maximum value from the resulting dataset. The calculated metrics are stored in a pandas DataFrame for neat display. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk is indicated when performance metrics values are low or there is a substantial discrepancy between the performance in training and testing datasets. A low AUC indicates poor classification performance, while a low GINI coefficient suggests low discriminatory power. High KS value, on the other hand, may indicate potential overfitting as it signifies a substantial gap between positive and negative distributions. **Strengths**: 1. This test provides multiple metrics (AUC, GINI, and KS) giving a broader perspective on the model's performance. 2. It compares the performance of the model on both training and testing datasets, offering insight into potential overfitting or underfitting. 3. The metrics used are invariant to class distribution and can effectively measure model performance even for imbalanced datasets. 4. Displays the metrics in a user-friendly, neatly formatted table. **Limitations**: 1. The GINI coefficient and KS statistic are reliant on the AUC value, meaning any error in AUC calculation will propagate and affect these metrics too. 2. It is mainly suitable for binary classification models and may require adjustments for multi-class scenarios. 3. The metrics used are threshold-dependent and may vary significantly based on chosen cut-off points. 4. The test does not contain any method to handle missing or inefficient data which might lead to inaccurate metrics if data is not preprocessed efficiently.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row62_col2" class="data row62 col2">**Purpose**: The "regression_forecast_plot" is intended to visually depict the performance of one or more regression models by comparing the model's forecasted outcomes against actual observed values within a specified date range. This metric is especially useful in time-series models or any model where the outcome changes over time, allowing direct comparison of predicted vs actual values. **Test Mechanism**: This test generates a plot for each fitted model in the list. The x-axis represents the date ranging from the specified "start_date" to the "end_date", while the y-axis shows the value of the outcome variable. Two lines are plotted: one representing the forecasted values and the other representing the observed values. The "start_date" and "end_date" can be parameters of this test; if these parameters are not provided, they are set to the minimum and maximum date available in the dataset. The test verifies that the provided date range is within the limits of the available data. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or failure signs could be deduced visually from the plots if the forecasted line significantly deviates from the observed line, indicating the model's predicted values are not matching actual outcomes. Furthermore, a model that struggles to handle the edge conditions like maximum and minimum data points could also be considered a sign of risk. **Strengths**: 1. Visualization: The plot provides an intuitive and clear illustration of how well the forecast matches the actual values, making it straightforward even for non-technical stakeholders to interpret. 2. Flexibility: It allows comparison for multiple models and for specified time periods. 3. Model Evaluation: It can be useful in identifying overfitting or underfitting situations, as these will manifest as discrepancies between the forecasted and observed values. **Limitations**: 1. Interpretation Bias: Interpretation of the plot is subjective and can lead to different conclusions by different evaluators. 2. Lack of Precision: Visual representation might not provide precise values of the deviation. 3. Inapplicability: Limited to cases where the order of data points (time-series) matters, it might not be of much use in problems that are not related to time series prediction.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row63_col2" class="data row63 col2">**Purpose**: The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is primarily utilized in this scenario to ascertain the order of integration of a given time series. In other words, it’s a metric to assess the stationarity of the time series data employed in the machine learning model. The stationary property of time series data is critical in many models as it directly impacts the reliability and robustness of predictions and forecasts. **Test Mechanism**: This test initiates by executing the ADF function from the statsmodels library for every feature in the dataset. Each run results in numerous outputs, including the ADF test statistic, the corresponding p-value, number of lags used, number of observations included in the test, critical values at different confidence levels, and the maximized information criterion. The results are then cached for each attribute for further analysis. **Signs of High Risk**: Observing a large ADF statistic and high p-value (typically above 0.05) would yet suggest a high risk for the model's performance. As both metrics indicate the presence of a unit root, they thus signify non-stationarity in the data series. Such characteristics can often lead to unreliable or inadequate forecasts. **Strengths**: The ADF test has the advantage of being robust to higher-order correlation within the dataset. This intrinsic merit makes it feasible to use in a variety of instances where data may exhibit complex stochastic behavior. Additionally, providing detailed information such as test statistics, critical values, and information criterion enhances the interpretability and transparency of the model validation process. **Limitations**: However, the ADF test does have its share of limitations. It might exhibit low statistical power, making it difficult for to distinguish between a unit root and a level of near-unit-root. This may lead to false negatives, where the test fails to reject a null hypothesis of a unit root when, in reality, it should. Furthermore, the ADF test assumes that the underlying series follows an autoregressive process, which might not always be the case. Lastly, handling time series with structural breaks can be challenging.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row64_col2" class="data row64 col2">**Purpose**: The Durbin-Watson Test metric is utilized to detect autocorrelation (i.e., a set of data values are influenced by their predecessors) in time series data. This is especially important in regression tasks, where the independence of residuals is often assumed. If there is a significant autocorrelation, the predictions of the model may not be reliable. **Test Mechanism**: The Durbin-Watson Test metric generates a statistical value for each feature of the training dataset. This is done through the `durbin_watson` function from the `statsmodels` library in Python. The function is looped through all columns of the dataset, calculating and storing the Durbin-Watson (DB) value for each column. The results are then cached and made available for further analysis. A Durbin-Watson metric value close to 2 suggests no autocorrelation, a value toward 0 indicates positive autocorrelation, and a value toward 4 shows negative autocorrelation. **Signs of High Risk**: If the Durbin-Watson value for any of the features is significantly different from 2, it indicates a high risk as it may point to significant autocorrelation issues within the dataset. Particularly, a value closer to '0' might hint at positive autocorrelation, while a value closer to '4' might suggest negative autocorrelation. These autocorrelation issues could lead to unreliable prediction models. **Strengths**: This metric is particularly powerful in identifying autocorrelation in the residuals of prediction models. With this metric, we can diagnose whether residuals have autocorrelation, which could violate the assumptions of various modeling techniques, particularly in regression analysis and time-series data modeling. **Limitations**: The Durbin-Watson Test has several limitations. First, it only detects linear autocorrelation and may miss other types of relationships. Second, it is significantly influenced by the order of data points, and shuffling the order can lead to entirely different results. Lastly, the test only checks for autocorrelation between a variable and its immediate preceding variable, essentially it's of order one, and cannot detect higher order autocorrelation.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row65_col2" class="data row65 col2">**Purpose**: This metric, Missing Values Risk, is intended to evaluate and quantify the risk associated with missing values in the data set being used for machine learning model training. This metric determines two specific risk measures: 1) what percentage of total data in the dataset are missing values, and 2) what percentage of total variables (i.e., columns) in the dataset have at least some missing values. **Test Mechanism**: The metric tests the dataset by first calculating the total number of datapoints in the data set and the total count of missing values. Then, it examines each column(variable) to find out how many contain at least one missing data point. By meticulously counting missing data points across the whole dataset and then within each variable(column), the metric determines the percentage of missing values in the total dataset and the percentage of columns(variables) with missing values. **Signs of High Risk**: High percentages in either of the risk measures could indicate a high risk. If the dataset has a high percentage of missing values, then it can significantly affect the performance and reliability of the model. Similarly, if a lot of variables (columns) in the dataset have missing values, the model might be prone to bias or overfitting. **Strengths**: This metric provides invaluable insight into the dataset's readiness for model training, as missing values can severely impact both the model's performance and its predictions. Quantifying the risk posed by missing values allows for targeted methods to handle these values properly, either through deletion, imputation, or other strategies. The metric is flexible and can be applied to both classification and regression tasks, thereby maintaining its utility across a broad range of models and scenarios. **Limitations**: This metric only identifies and quantifies the risk of missing values but does not offer any solutions to mitigate this risk. More specifically, it does not infer whether the missingness is random or linked to some underlying issue in data collection or preprocessing. Nonetheless, identifying the presence and extent of missingness is the essential first step in data-quality improvement.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row66_col2" class="data row66 col2">**Purpose**: The "Interquartile Range Outliers Table" (IQROutliersTable) metric is used to detect and summarize outliers in numerical features of a dataset using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. Outliers, values that deviate substantially from general patterns of the data, are crucial to be identified in data pre-processing as they can lead to serious problems in statistical analyses and may degrade the performance of machine learning models. **Test Mechanism**: This metric works by calculating the IQR (the range between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile)) of each numerical feature in a given dataset. An outlier is defined as a data point that falls below "Q1 - 1.5 * IQR" or above "Q3 + 1.5 * IQR". The number of outliers, as well as their minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum values, are computed and collected for each numerical feature. If no specific features are selected, the metric will be applied to all numerical features in the dataset. Users can customize the outlier threshold. By default, it's 1.5, following the standard definition of outliers in statistical analysis. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk is indicated by a large number of outliers in multiple features, as well as outliers that are far from the mean value of variables, which suggest that they deviate significantly from the general patterns of the data. Additionally, extremely high or low outlier values might also point to data entry errors or other data quality issues. **Strengths**: 1. This metric provides a comprehensive summary of outliers for each numerical feature in the dataset, which can help users identify features with potential quality issues. 2. It's versatile and customizable, allowing users to select specific features and set a custom threshold for defining outliers. 3. The IQR method is robust to the influence of extreme outlier values as it's based on quartile calculations. **Limitations**: 1. This metric might generate false positives if the variable of interest does not follow a normal or near-normal distribution, specifically in case of skewed distributions. 2. It does not provide interpretation or recommendations for handling outliers. The results need to be analyzed by users or data scientists. 3. It only works on numerical features and cannot be used for categorical data. 4. If the data has been heavily pre-processed or manipulated, or if it naturally has a high kurtosis (heavy tails), the set threshold may not work optimally for outlier detection.</td>

The primary aim is to evaluate and comprehend the relationship between different feature pairs while emphasizing the model's target variable. These bivariate plots are extremely useful in revealing trends, correlations, patterns or anomalies that might not be immediately obvious in tabular data. **Test Mechanism**: The test constructs bar plots for each feature pair defined in the parameters. It groups the dataset by each feature pair and calculates the mean of the target variable within each pair grouping. Each group is represented as a bar in the plot with the height of the bar corresponding to the calculated mean. The colors of the bars are determined by the specific category they belong to: either taken from a colormap or generated if the number of categories exceeds the colormap's capacity. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or failure may be indicated if: 1. Any values are missing or inconsistent in the feature pairs. 2. Large differences or variations exist between the mean values of certain categories within the feature pairs. 3. The parameters for feature pairs are not defined or are defined incorrectly. **Strengths**: 1. BivariateFeaturesBarPlots provides a clear, visual understanding of the relationships between feature pairs and the target variable. 2.

It can only be used with categorical data, limiting its utility with numerical or text data. 2. It's dependent on manual input for feature pairs, which may lead to overlooking important feature pairs if not chosen wisely. 3. The generated bar plots can become very cluttered and hard to interpret when dealing with feature pairs with a large number of categories. 4.

<td id="T_9d30f_row68_col2" class="data row68 col2">**Purpose**: The Skewness test is designed to measure the degree to which a given distribution deviates from a normal distribution, indicating any asymmetry in the predictive model's data. The skewness metric can be positive (indicating a distribution with a long tail to the right) or negative (signifying a tail to the left). As consistency and correct data distribution is paramount to good model performance, understanding skewness can assist in identifying data quality issues, making it integral for data profiling in both classic classification and regression machine learning models. **Test Mechanism**: The test is performed by calculating the skewness of numerical columns in the dataset. The skewness is obtained from the DataFrame of the dataset, constrained to numerical data types. An absolute value for the skewness is compared against a maximum threshold (default value of 1). If the calculated value is less than this maximum threshold, the test is marked 'Pass'; otherwise, it's considered 'Fail'. The results are then cached, with the list of result classes for each column indicating the column name, the passed status, and its skewness value compliance. **Signs of High Risk**: Indicators of high risk or potential model performance issues associated with this test include high skewness levels that greatly exceed the max_threshold in a negative or positive direction, representing skewed distribution in data. If data appears consistently skewed, it can show that the underlying assumptions of the Machine Learning model may not apply, and can lead to poor model performance, wrong predictions, or biased inferences. **Strengths**: The skewness test allows for rapid identification of unequal data distributions, which may go unnoticed but may considerably affect the performance of a machine learning model. The test is flexible and can be adapted according to the users' needs, adjusting the maximum threshold parameter. **Limitations**: The test only runs on numeric columns, which means that data in non-numeric columns could still hold bias or problematic skewness not captured by this test. Secondly, it assumes data to follow a normal distribution, which might not always be a realistic expectation in real-world data. Finally, by relying heavily on a manually set threshold, the risk grading might be either too strict or too lenient depending on the chosen threshold, something that might require expertise and iterations to perfect.</td>

It specifically targets duplication in a designated text column or among the primary keys of the dataset, which can have significant implications for model performance and integrity. Duplicate entries can potentially distort data distribution and skew model training. **Test Mechanism**: The test works by counting the total number of duplicate entries within the dataset. If a 'text_column' property is specified, the algorithm will count duplicates within this column. If any primary key is declared, the test will be run on the primary keys as well. The number of duplicates ('n_duplicates') is then compared to a predefined minimum threshold (default 'min_threshold' is set to 1) to determine if the test has passed. Results include total number of duplicates, and the percentage of duplicate rows in the overall dataset ('p_duplicates'). **Signs of High Risk**: The existence of a significant number of duplicates, especially exceeding the minimum threshold, indicates high risk. Potential issues include an overrepresentation of certain data (thus skewing results), or the indication of inefficient data collecting methods leading to data redundancy. Models that predominantly fail this test may need to have their data preprocessing methods or source data reviewed. **Strengths**: The Duplicates test is versatile and can be applied to both text data and tabular data formats. It also provides results calculated both as a count and as a percentage of the total dataset, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the extent of duplication. This metric can effectively flag data quality issues that can skew your model performance and lead to inaccurate predictions. **Limitations**: The Duplicates test only targets exact duplication in entries, which might overlook close 'almost-duplicate' entries, or normalized forms of entries, that may also impact data distribution and model integrity. Data variations due to errors, slight changes in phrasing, or other inconsistencies may not be detected. Furthermore, a high number of duplicates in a dataset may not always indicate poor data quality, depending on the nature of data and the problem being addressed.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row70_col2" class="data row70 col2">**Purpose**: The 'MissingValuesBarPlot' metric generates a visual representation that highlights the percentage of missing values in each column of a dataset used in an ML model. This visualization is used to quickly identify and quantify missing data, a critical step in data preprocessing. Missing data can distort the predictions of an ML model and reduce its accuracy. The metric also applies a user-defined threshold to classify columns into those with missing data above (high-risk) and below (less-risk) the threshold. **Test Mechanism**: This metric scans through each column in the input dataset and calculates the percentage of missing values. It preferentially selects columns that have at least some missing data (more than 0%). Each column's missing data percentage is then examined against the predefined threshold. Columns with missing data above the threshold are classified as high-risk. A bar plot is then generated; columns with missing data are displayed on the y-axis, while their corresponding missing data percentages are plotted on the x-axis. Each bar's color is dictated by the missing data's percentage relation to the threshold. Values below the threshold are grey, while ones above are light coral. A red dashed line represents the user-defined threshold on the plot. **Signs of High Risk**: Columns in the dataset represented by light coral bars indicate a high risk. These columns have a higher percentage of missing values than the threshold. If a significant number of columns or crucial features fall into this category, it implies a substantial risk for reliable model performance. **Strengths**: This method offers a snapshot overview of missing data across all the dataset's columns, making it easier to identify problematic areas promptly. It not only helps with quantitative assessment but also with pattern recognition through its visual summary. The user-defined threshold allows a customized level of risk tolerance. It also supports classification and regression tasks, adding to its versatility. **Limitations**: This metric purely looks at the number of missing values and doesn't consider the type of missingness (MCAR, MAR, NMAR) or methods for handling missing entries (like imputation strategies). It also doesn't factor in the potential impact of missing data on the model's accuracy or precision. It might require expert understanding to interpret the findings and take appropriate action.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row71_col2" class="data row71 col2">**Purpose**: This test is used to provide a variety of descriptive statistics about the input data used in a machine learning model. Such statistics include measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, and frequency counts for each field (i.e. feature or variable) in the dataset. This helps in understanding the nature of the data, identifying outliers, and understanding how well the data meets the assumptions of the model. **Test Mechanism**: The mechanism starts by transforming the input dataset to its basic form by reversing any one-hot encoding and extracting each field from the dataset. Descriptive statistics are then computed for each field depending on its data type (Numeric, Categorical, Boolean, Dummy, Text, Null). For numeric fields, statistics like mean, standard deviation, min, max and various percentiles are computed. For categorical and boolean fields, frequency counts of each category and the most frequent category (top) are computed. Missing and distinct values are computed for all fields. Additionally, the test generates histograms of the data for numeric and categorical types, as well as word count histograms for text simply by counting the number of occurrences of every distinct word. **Signs of High Risk**: Areas of potential high risk include a significant proportion of missing or null values which may affect the model's performance. Also, predominance of a single value (low diversity) in a feature, high variance in a numeric feature, or high number of distinct categories in categorical features may signal problems with the model. High frequency of a particular word in text data could also indicate bias. **Strengths**: This test effectively provides a comprehensive, high-level summary of the dataset. It aids in understanding the distribution, dispersion, and central tendency of numeric features, and the frequency distribution in categorical and text features. It effectively handles different data types and provides insight into the variety and distribution of field values. **Limitations**: This metric doesn’t provide insights into the relationships between different fields or features; it only provides univariate analysis. The statistical description for text data is also quite limited, essentially being a bag-of-words model. The descriptive statistics like mean, standard deviation are not meaningful for ordinal categorical data.

This scatter plot matrix includes all columns (or features) in the dataset and is intended to reveal relationships, patterns, or outliers among different features. This visual representation can give both qualitative and quantitative insights into the multidimensional relationships in the dataset, which can be useful in understanding the suitability and effectiveness of selected features for model training. **Test Mechanism**: The ScatterPlot class utilizes the seaborn library to generate the scatter plot matrix. It first retrieves all columns from the input dataset, ensures that the specified columns exist in the dataset, and then creates a pairplot for these columns. It uses the kernel density estimate (kde) for a smoother, univariate distribution along the diagonal of the grid. The final plot is stored in an array of Figure objects, each encapsulating matplotlib figure instance for storage and later usage. **Signs of High Risk**: Signs of potential risk could be the appearance of non-linear or random patterns across different feature pairs indicating complex relationships not suitable for linear assumptions. Additionally, showing no clear patterns or clusters might indicate weak or non-existent correlations among features, posing a challenge for certain model types. Visualization of outliers may also be a sign of risk as outliers can negatively impact model performance. **Strengths**: The utilization of a scatter plot matrix for data analysis provides various strengths: 1. It provides visual insight into the multidimensional relationships among multiple features. 2. It helps to identify trends, correlations, and outliers that could impact model performance. 3. As a diagnostic tool, it can suggest whether certain assumptions taken during model creation (like linearity) are valid. 4. It is versatile and can be used for both classification and regression type tasks. **Limitations**: Scatter plot matrices, however, also present a few limitations: 1. They can become highly cluttered and difficult to interpret as the number of features (columns) increases. 2.

<td id="T_9d30f_row73_col2" class="data row73 col2">**Purpose**: This test is designed to identify outliers in time-series data using the z-score method. It's vital for ensuring data quality before modeling, as outliers can skew predictive models and significantly impact their overall performance. **Test Mechanism**: The test processes a given dataset which must have datetime indexing, checks if a 'zscore_threshold' parameter has been supplied, and identifies columns with numeric data types. After finding numeric columns, the implementer then applies the z-score method to each numeric column, identifying outliers based on the threshold provided. Each outlier is listed together with their variable name, z-score, timestamp and relative threshold in a dictionary and converted to a DataFrame for convenient output. Additionally, it produces visual plots for each time series illustrating outliers in the context of the broader dataset. The 'zscore_threshold' parameter sets the limit beyond which a data point will be labeled as an outlier. The default threshold is set at 3, indicating that any data point that falls 3 standard deviations away from the mean will be marked as an outlier. **Signs of High Risk**: If many or substantial outliers are present within a dataset, this may be an indicator of high risk as it suggests that the dataset contains significant anomalies. This could potentially affect the performance of the machine learning models, if not properly addressed. Data points with z-scores higher than the set threshold would be flagged as outliers and could be considered as high risk. **Strengths**: 1. The z-score method is a popular and robust method for identifying outliers in a dataset. 2. Time series maintenance is simplified through requiring a datetime index. 3. Outliers are identified for each numeric feature individually. 4. Provides an elaborate report which shows variables, date, z-score and whether the test passed or failed. 5. Offers visual inspection for detected outliers in the respective time-series through plots. **Limitations**: 1. This test only identifies outliers in numeric columns, and won't identify outliers in categorical variables. 2. The utility and accuracy of z-scores can be limited if the data doesn’t follow a normal distribution. 3. The method relies on a subjective z-score threshold for deciding what constitutes an outlier, which might not always be suitable depending on the dataset and the use case. 4. It does not address possible ways to handle identified outliers in the data. 5. The necessity for a datetime index could limit the extent of its application.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row74_col2" class="data row74 col2">**Purpose**: The purpose of this metric is to visually analyze categorical data using bar plots. It is intended to evaluate the dataset's composition by displaying the counts of each category in each categorical feature. **Test Mechanism**: The provided dataset is first checked to determine if it contains any categorical variables. If no categorical columns are found, the tool raises a ValueError. For each categorical variable in the dataset, a separate bar plot is generated. The number of occurrences for each category is calculated and displayed on the plot. If a dataset contains multiple categorical columns, multiple bar plots are produced. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk could occur if the categorical variables exhibit an extreme imbalance, with categories having very few instances possibly being underrepresented in the model, which could affect the model's performance and its ability to generalize. Another sign of risk is if there are too many categories in a single variable, which could lead to overfitting and make the model complex. **Strengths**: This metric provides a visual and intuitively understandable representation of categorical data, which aids in the analysis of variable distributions. By presenting model inputs in this way, we can easily identify imbalances or rare categories that could affect the model's performance. **Limitations**: This method only works with categorical data, meaning it won't apply to numerical variables. In addition, the method does not provide any informative value when there are too many categories, as the bar chart could become cluttered and hard to interpret. It offers no insights into the model's performance or precision, but rather provides a descriptive analysis of the input.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row75_col2" class="data row75 col2">**Purpose**: This test, AutoStationarity, is used to automatically detect and evaluate the stationarity of each time series in a Dataframe, using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. Stationarity is a crucial property in time series data, which indicates that a series' statistical features such as mean and variance are constant over time. This property is an underlying assumption for many time-series models. **Test Mechanism**: The test performs the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test on each time series in a provided DataFrame to determine if the time series is stationary. A loop is ran over each column (time series) of the DataFrame. For each series, the ADF test is performed up to a maximum order of differencing (default value 5, configurable via params). The p-value of the ADF test is compared against a predefined threshold (default value 0.05, configurable via params). If the p-value is less than the threshold, the series is considered stationary at the current order of differencing. **Signs of High Risk**: The high risk or failure in the model's performance may be indicated by a significant number of series failing to achieve stationarity up to the maximum order of differencing. This might suggest that the series are not well-modeled by a stationary process and other modeling strategies might be needed. **Strengths**: By automating the ADF test, this metric allows for the mass analysis of stationarity across a multitude of time series, greatly increasing the efficiency and reliability of the analysis. The use of the ADF test, a commonly accepted method for testing stationarity, gives credibility to the results. Furthermore, the implementation of max order and threshold parameters allows users to specify their preferred level of strictness in the tests. **Limitations**: The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test and stationarity check generally have limitations. They rely on the assumption that the series are well-modeled by an autoregressive process, which may not be the case for all time series. The stationarity check is also sensitive to the choice of the threshold value for the significance level. Too high or too low threshold may lead to erroneous conclusions about stationary properties. There is also a risk of over-differencing if the maximum order is set too high, leading to unnecessary cycles.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row76_col2" class="data row76 col2">**Purpose**: The purpose of the Descriptive Statistics metric is to provide a comprehensive summary of both numerical and categorical data within a dataset. For numerical data, it gathers statistics such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values, as well as certain percentiles. For categorical data, it calculates the count, number of unique values, most frequent value, frequency of the most common value, and the proportion of the most frequent value relative to the total. This metric aids in visualizing the overall distribution of the variables in the dataset, which in turn assists in understanding the model's behavior and predicting its performance. **Test Mechanism**: The test mechanism involves using the describe() function for numerical fields which computes several summary statistics and value_counts() for categorical fields which counts unique values. Both of these functions are built-in methods of pandas dataframes. The results are then formatted to create two separate tables, one for numerical and one for categorical variable summaries. These tables provide a clear summary of the main characteristics of these variables, which can be crucial in assessing the model's performance. **Signs of High Risk**: High risks can be found in evidence of skewed data or notable outliers. This could be reflected in the mean and median (50% percentile) having a significant difference, in the case of numerical data. For categorical data, high risk can be indicated by a lack of diversity (low count of unique values), or overdominance of a single category (high frequency of the top value). **Strengths**: The primary strength of this metric lies in its ability to provide a comprehensive summary of the dataset, providing insights on the distribution and characteristics of the variables under consideration. It is a flexible and robust method, relevant to both numerical and categorical data. It can help highlight anomalies such as outliers, extreme skewness, or lack of diversity which can be essential in understanding model behavior during testing and validation. **Limitations**: While this metric provides a high-level overview of the data, it may not be sufficient to detect subtle correlations or complex patterns in the data. It does not provide any info on the relationship between variables. Plus, descriptive statistics alone cannot be used to infer properties about future unseen data. It should be used in conjunction with other statistical tests to provide a thorough understanding of the model's data.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row77_col2" class="data row77 col2">**Purpose**: The ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) One Way Table metric is used to evaluate whether the mean of numerical variables differs across different groups identified by the target or categorical variables. It plays a key role in identifying whether categorical variables have a significant effect on the numerical variables of interest. This metric helps in understanding and detecting features that are statistically significant with regard to the target variable in a given dataset. **Test Mechanism**: This metric performs an ANOVA F-test on each of the numerical variables against the target. Should no specific features be indicated, the test is conducted on all numerical features. A p-value is generated for each test and compared against a specified threshold, defaulting to 0.05 if none is given. The feature is marked as 'Pass' if the p-value is less than or equal to the specified threshold, indicating that there is a significant difference in the means of the groups, and 'Fail' otherwise. The test results are returned in a DataFrame indicating the variable name, F statistic value, p-value, threshold, and pass/fail status for each numerical variable. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or failure in the model may be indicated by a large number of 'Fail' results in the ANOVA F-test. This suggests that many numerical variables in the dataset display no statistically significant difference across the target variable groups, potentially leading to underperforming predictions. Additionally, features with high p-values also indicate a high risk as they display a larger chance of obtaining the observed data given that the null hypothesis is true. **Strengths**: - The ANOVA One Way Table is an efficient tool in identifying statistically significant features as it compares the means of multiple groups simultaneously. - This metric is flexible and can handle situations where numerical features have not been specified by testing all numerical features in the dataset. - It provides a convenient way to measure the statistical significance of numerical variables and assists in picking those variables that significantly influence the classifier's predictions. **Limitations**: - The ANOVA One Way Table metric assumes that the data is normally distributed, which might not be the case, potentially leading to inaccurate test results. - The F-test is sensitive to variance changes, and therefore, this metric might not perform well in datasets with high variance. - The ANOVA One Way test does not indicate which specific group means are statistically different from each other; it merely tells that there is a difference. - The metric does not provide insight into interactions between variables, and it might fail to detect significant effects due to these interactions.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row78_col2" class="data row78 col2">**Purpose**: The purpose of this metric is to visually summarize the distinct categorizations made by a classification-oriented machine learning model. Specifically, it generates bar plots representing target rate ratios for different categorical variables within the input dataset. This makes it easier to evaluate the performance of the classification model and gain quick insights into its accuracy. **Test Mechanism**: The test mechanic involves the creation of two bar plots for each categorical feature in the dataset. The first plot counts the number of times each category appears in the dataset, using a unique color to facilitate identification. On the second plot, it calculates the average target rate for each category and plots these averages. The target rate value comes from the column specified as "default_column." The plots are generated using the Plotly library in Python, with subplots created for each feature. If no specific columns are indicated, all categorical feature columns in the dataset will be used to generate the plot. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or failure signs might involve inconsistent or non-binary values in the "default_column," making it difficult to calculate a meaningful default rate. Another risk sign could be an unusually low or high default rate for any particular category, suggesting the model might be wrongly classifying data points for those categories. **Strengths**: The main strength of this metric is its ability to provide a clear, visual representation of the model's categorization patterns. This helps stakeholders spot anomalies, inconsistencies, or trends in model behavior quickly. The metric is also flexible, allowing for the examination of a single column or multiple columns in the data. **Limitations**: This metric only works well with categorical data, limiting its application to numeric or continuous variables. It also assumes binary target values (only 0s and 1s), making it less useful for multi-class problems. The bar plots can become confusing and less interpretable if the dataset has too many distinct categories.</td>

It provides the Pearson Correlation coefficient, which reveals any high correlations present. The purpose of doing this is to identify potential redundancy, as variables that are highly correlated can often be removed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset without significantly impacting the model's performance. **Test Mechanism**: This metric test generates a correlation matrix for all numerical variables in the dataset using the Pearson correlation formula. A heat map is subsequently created to visualize this matrix effectively. The color of each point on the heat map corresponds to the magnitude and direction (positive or negative) of the correlation, with a range from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation). Any correlation coefficients higher than 0.7 (in absolute terms) are indicated in white in the heat map, suggesting a high degree of correlation. **Signs of High Risk**: High-risk signs pertaining to this metric might include a large number of variables in the dataset showing a high degree of correlation (coefficients approaching ±1). This indicates redundancy within the dataset, suggesting that some variables may not be contributing new information to the model. This could potentially lead to overfitting. **Strengths**: The primary strength of this metric test is its ability to detect and quantify the linearity of relationships between variables. This allows for the identification of redundant variables, which in turn can help in simplifying models and potentially improving their performance. The visualization aspect (heatmap) is another strength as it offers an easy-to-understand overview of the correlations, beneficial for those not comfortable navigating numerical matrices. **Limitations**: The primary limitation of Pearson Correlation is its inability to detect non-linear relationships between variables, which can lead to missed opportunities for dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, it only measures the degree of linear relationship and not the strength of effect of one variable on the other. The cutoff value of 0.7 for high correlation is a somewhat arbitrary choice and some valid dependencies might be missed if they have a correlation coefficient less than this value.</td>

A high correlation means the feature strongly influences the target variable - something particularly useful in feature selection and understanding model behaviour. **Test Mechanism**: The FeatureTargetCorrelationPlot test computes correlations between features and the target variable of a given dataset. The correlations are calculated and then plotted in a horizontal bar graph, with color varying according to the strength of the correlation. An automatic hover template is also provided for descriptive tooltips. The features to be analyzed can be specified, and the graph's height can be adjusted per requirement. **Signs of High Risk**: Absence of any strong correlations (either positive or negative) between features and the target variable might suggest a high risk as it indicates that the given features don't have a significant influence on the prediction output. Also, duplication of correlation values might indicate redundancy in feature selection. **Strengths**: This test provides a visual aid, significantly improving the interpretation of correlations and giving a clear, easy-to-understand overview of how each feature impacts the model's target variable. This aids in feature selection and in understanding the nature of model predictions. Additionally, the hover template provides precise correlation values for each feature, essential for a granular level understanding. **Limitations**: The test only works with numerical data, so variables of other types must be preprocessed. Also, the plot assumes a linear correlation - it cannot efficiently capture non-linear relationships. One more limitation is that it may not accurately reflect importance for models that use complex interactions of features, like Decision Trees or Neural Networks.</td>

It helps in understanding if the inputs to the model are normally distributed which is a common assumption in many machine learning algorithms. **Test Mechanism**: This test scans the provided dataset and extracts all the numerical columns. For each numerical column, it constructs a histogram using plotly, with 50 bins. The deployment of histograms offers a robust visual aid, ensuring unruffled identification and understanding of numerical data distribution patterns. **Signs of High Risk**: A high degree of skewness, unexpected data distributions or existence of extreme outliers in the histograms may indicate issues with the data that the model is receiving. If data for a numerical feature is expected to follow a certain distribution (like normal distribution) but does not, it could lead to sub-par performance by the model. As such these instances should be treated as high-risk indicators. **Strengths**: This test offers several advantages: - It provides a simple, easy-to-interpret visualization of how data for each numerical attribute is distributed. - It can help detect skewed values and outliers, that could potentially harm the AI model's performance. - It can be applied to large datasets and multiple numerical variables conveniently. **Limitations**: Despite its effectiveness, this test does have some limitations: - It only works with numerical data, thus ignoring non-numerical or categorical data. - It does not analyze relationships between different features, only the individual feature distributions. - It is a univariate analysis, and may miss patterns or anomalies that only appear when considering multiple variables together. - It does not provide any insight into how these features affect the output of the model; it is purely an input analysis tool.</td>

It assumes anomalous data points, due to their distinctive properties, can be detected more quickly by the isolation forest algorithm. This algorithm evaluates anomalies through the creation of isolation trees and identifying instances with shorter average path lengths in these trees, as these instances are expected to be different from the majority of the data points. **Test Mechanism**: This test uses the isolation forest algorithm, which isolates anomalies rather than identifying normal data points. It runs by building an ensemble of isolation trees, utilizing binary trees created by randomly selecting features and splitting the data based on random thresholds. For each pair of variables, it generates a scatter plot distinguishing the identified outliers from the inliers. The test results are visualized in these scatter plots showing the distinction of outliers from inliers. **Signs of High Risk**: Signs of high risk or failure in the model's performance might be the presence of high contamination which indicates a lot of anomalies, an inability to detect clusters of anomalies that are geographically close in the feature space, detecting normal instances as anomalies or overlooking actual anomalies. **Strengths**: The strengths of the isolation forest algorithm include its ability to handle large high-dimensional datasets, its efficiency in isolating anomalies rather than normal instances tradition, and its insensitivity to the underlying distribution of data. It is able to recognize anomalies even when they are not separated from the data cloud by identifying distinctive properties of the anomalies. Additionally, it visualizes the test results, aiding understanding and interpretability. **Limitations**: Among its limitations, the isolation forest test might find it hard to detect anomalies that are close to each other, or in datasets where anomalies are more prevalent. The results strongly rely on the contamination parameter, which might need fine-tuning to be effective. It may also not be effective in detecting collective anomalies if they behave similarly to normal data. Furthermore, it potentially lacks precision in identifying which features contribute most to the anomalous behavior.</td>

The Chi-Squared test is designed to determine if there's a significant association between the categorical features and the target variable. It is typically used in the context of Model Risk Management to comprehend feature relevance and identify potential bias in a classification model. **Test Mechanism**: This test involves creating a contingency table for each categorical variable and the target variable, and then performing a Chi-Squared test. The Chi-Squared statistic and the p-value for each feature are calculated using this method. The p-value threshold is a parameter that can be adjusted, and a test will pass if the p-value is less than or equal to this threshold. If not, the test will fail. The test result for each feature - consisting of variable name, Chi-squared statistic, p-value, threshold, and pass/fail status - is aggregated into a final summary table. **Signs of High Risk**: Red Flags for high risk include high p-values (greater than the set threshold) for certain variables. These high p-values suggest there is not a statistically significant relationship between the feature and the target variables, resulting in a 'Fail' status. If a categorical feature has no relevant association with the target variable, it can signal that the machine learning model may not be performing well. **Strengths**: This test allows for a thorough examination of the interaction between a model's input features and the target output, helping to validate the relevance of the categorical features. It also provides a clear 'Pass/Fail' output for each categorical feature. The ability to adjust the p-value threshold adds flexibility to suit different statistical standards. **Limitations**: The metric assumes that the data is tabular and categorical, which may not apply to all datasets. It is specifically designed for classification tasks and not suitable for regression scenarios. It's also important to remember that the Chi-squared test, like any test based on hypothesis testing, is not able to identify causal relationships; it can only reveal associations. Moreover, the test relies on an adjustable p-value threshold, and different threshold choices may lead to different conclusions about feature relevance.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row84_col2" class="data row84 col2">**Purpose**: The “High Cardinality” test functions to assess and evaluate the number of unique values present in the categorical columns of a dataset. Cardinality represents the measure of distinct elements residing in a set. In context of this test, high cardinality implies presence of a large quantity of unique, non-repetitive values in the dataset. **Test Mechanism**: This test begins by inferring the type of the dataset and initializing numeric threshold based on the test parameters. If the “threshold_type” is set to “percent”, it calculates the numeric threshold as the product of “percent_threshold” and the count of rows in the dataset. Subsequently, the test commences iteration through each column in the dataset. It limits the evaluation to those columns which are categorized as "Categorical". For each categorical column, the number of distinct values (n_distinct) and the percentage of distinct values (p_distinct) are computed. The test asserts success if n_distinct is less than the calculated numeric threshold. The summary method compiles results in tabulated form, with details for each column including column name, number of distinct values, percentage of distinct values, and pass/fail status. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or failure in model performance may be indicated by a large number of distinct values (high cardinality) in one or more categorical columns. If any column fails the test (n_distinct &gt;= num_threshold), it is a sign of high risk. **Strengths**: The High Cardinality test is valuable in detecting overfitting risks and potential noise. High cardinality in categorical variables may trigger overfitting in machine learning models as the models can excessively adapt to the training data. It also helps in identifying potential outliers and inconsistencies, therefore aids in enhancing the data quality. It can be applied to both classification and regression task types, which lends versatility to the test. **Limitations**: Despite its numerous benefits, the High Cardinality test has certain limitations. It is solely applicable to "Categorical" data types, and not suitable for numerical or continuous features, limiting its scope. Furthermore, the test does not inherently assert the relevance or importance of unique values in categorical features, thus critical data points may be overlooked. The threshold (both number and percent) used for the test is static and likely to be non-optimal for diverse datasets and applications, it might benefit from additional mechanisms to adapt and fine-tune this dynamic.</td>

This offers a way to evaluate the data quality, which is crucial to the predictive strength and reliability of any machine learning model. It aims to ensure that the ratio of missing data to total data is less than a predefined threshold, which in this case defaults to 1. **Test Mechanism**: The test iteratively runs through each column in the dataset, counting the number of missing values (NaNs) and calculating the percentage of missing values compared to the total number of rows. It then checks if the number of missing values is less than the pre-defined `min_threshold`. The results are summarized in a table that lists each column, the number of missing values, the percentage of missing values in each column, and a Pass/Fail status based on the comparison with the threshold. **Signs of High Risk**: A high risk is indicated when the number of missing values in any column exceeds the `min_threshold` value. Another sign of high risk is when there are missing values spread across many columns. In both cases, the test would issue a "Fail" mark on the Pass/Fail status. **Strengths**: This test helps to identify the presence and extent of missing data quickly and at a granular level (each feature in the dataset). It provides an effective and straightforward way to maintain data quality, which is crucial for building effective machine learning models. **Limitations**: While the test can efficiently detect missing data, it does not address the root causes of these missing values or suggest ways to impute or handle such values. It also does not consider situations where a feature has a significant amount of missing values, but still less than the `min_threshold`, which might also affect the model in cases where `min_threshold` is set too high. Lastly, this test does not account for data encoded as values (e.g., "-999" or "None"), which may technically not be missing but could carry the same implications.</td>

This measurement is critical in evaluating the performance of credit risk models, allowing users to understand and compare default rates across diverse categories of risk. **Test Mechanism**: The test is conducted through a computed bar plot. The plot is generated by first calculating the count of accounts in each risk band, converting these counts into percentages by dividing by the total number of accounts, and then visualizing these percentages in the form of a bar plot. The bar plot thereby clearly indicates the percentage of total accounts associated with each risk band, providing a visual summary of default risk across these bands. The plot uses the 'Dark24' color sequence to ensure distinguishable colors for each risk band. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk is indicated with a high percentage of accounts associated with high-risk bands. The higher the percentage of accounts in these bands, the higher the exposure to default risk in the dataset. This could suggest potential failures in the model's ability to effectively manage or predict credit risk. **Strengths**: The main strengths of this metric are its simplicity and its visual impact. By graphically displaying the default rates, the metric provides a clear visual aid for understanding the spread of default risk across risk bands. The use of a bar chart provides an easy comparison between the different risk bands, helping to highlight any imbalances or areas of high risk. This helps to draw attention to any disproportions or anomalies in the data, making it easier to evaluate and compare the performance of credit risk models. **Limitations**: The main limitation of this metric is that it doesn't provide any insights into why certain risk bands have higher default rates. Additionally, it might not accurately represent the distribution of risk if some risk bands have significantly more accounts than others. It also doesn't consider other factors contributing to credit risk outside of the risk bands. Finally, the metric's reliance on visualization means that the results could be misinterpreted if not carefully analyzed, as graphical representations can sometimes be misleading.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row87_col2" class="data row87 col2">**Purpose**: The `RollingStatsPlot` metric is used to assess the stationarity of time series data in a given dataset. More specifically, the metric evaluates the rolling mean and rolling standard deviation of the dataset over a defined window size. The rolling mean is a measure of the average trend in the data, while the rolling standard deviation assesses the data's volatility within the window. These measures are critical for preparing time series data for modeling as they provide insights into the behavior of the data over time. **Test Mechanism**: The testing mechanism is divided into two steps. Firstly, the rolling mean and standard deviation for each column of the dataset are calculated over a window size, specified by the user or defaulted to 12 data points. Secondly, the rolling mean and standard deviation are plotted separately, thus visualizing the trends and volatility in the dataset. A basic check is performed to ensure that the columns exist in the dataset and that the provided dataset is indexed by date and time, which is a requirement for time series analysis. **Signs of High Risk**: Signs that could indicate high risk include: 1. A non-stationary pattern in either the rolling mean or the rolling standard deviation plot. This might mean that the data has trends or seasonality, which could affect the performance of time series models. 2. Missing columns in the dataset, which would prevent the metric from running successfully. 3. The presence of NaN values in the dataset. These might need to be handled before the metric can proceed. **Strengths**: The strengths of this metric include: 1. Providing visualizations of the data's trending behaviour and volatility, which can aid in understanding the overall characteristics of the data. 2. Checking the integrity of the dataset (whether all designated columns exist, and that the index is of datetime type). 3. Adapting to various window sizes, which allows for flexibility in analysing data with different temporal granularities. 4. Accommodating multi-feature datasets by considering each column of the data individually. **Limitations**: Some limitations of the `RollingStatsPlot` metric include: 1. A fixed window size is used for all columns, which may not accurately capture the patterns in datasets where different features have different optimal window sizes. 2. The metric requires the dataset to be indexed by date and time, hence may not be applicable to datasets without a timestamp index. 3. The metrics primarily serve for data visualization. It does not provide any quantitative measures for stationarity, such as statistical tests. Thus, interpretation is subjective and depends on the discretion of the modeler.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row88_col2" class="data row88 col2">**Purpose**: The DatasetCorrelations metric is employed to examine the relationship between variables in a dataset, specifically designed for numerical and categorical data types. Using Pearson's R, Cramer's V, and Correlation ratios, it helps in understanding the linear relationship between numerical variables, association between categorical ones, and between numerical-categorical variables respectively. This allows for better awareness regarding dependency between features, which is crucial for optimizing model performance and understanding the model's behavior and predictors. **Test Mechanism**: During its execution, DatasetCorrelations initiates the calculation of the aforementioned correlation coefficients for the provided dataset. It leverages the built-in method 'get_correlations()', populating the 'correlations' attribute in the dataset object. It then invokes 'get_correlation_plots()' to generate graphical representations of these correlations. Finally, the correlation details and figures are cached for further study and analysis. The test does not dictate specific thresholds or grading scales. **Signs of High Risk**: Signs of high risk might involve the presence of high correlation levels between input variables (multicollinearity), which can jeopardize the interpretability of the model and lead to overfitting. Additionally, the absence of any significant correlations, which suggests that the variables might not have predictive power. **Strengths**: The test boasts the advantage of being comprehensive; it covers the correlation study of numerical, categorical, and numerical-categorical variables. Thus, it negates the need for multiple individual tests. Furthermore, it not only provides numerical correlation values, but also visualization plots, aiding in a more intuitive understanding of relationships between variables. **Limitations**: This metric, however, is limited by the fact that it only detects linear relationships and associations; nonlinear relationships may go unnoticed. Also, given the absence of specified thresholds for determining correlation significance, the interpretation of the results is dependent on the user's expertise. Lastly, it doesn't handle missing values in the dataset, which need to be treated beforehand.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row89_col2" class="data row89 col2">**Purpose**: The primarily purpose of this metric is to gather and present descriptive statistics for numerical, categorical and datetime variables from a given dataset. This helps in understanding the core traits of the dataset like the count, mean, min, max, percentage of missing values, data types of fields, unique values in case of categorical fields, amongst other descriptors. **Test Mechanism**: The methodology for this metric involves first segregating the variables in the dataset into their data types - numerical, categorical or datetime. Once they are segregated, the metric gathers the summary statistics for each variable type. The capture of these summary statistics varies depending upon the type of variable. For numerical variables, it extracts descriptors like count, mean, min, max, count of missing values and data type. For categorical variables, it extracts descriptors like count, number of unique values, display of unique values, count of missing values, and data type. For datetime variables, it extracts descriptors like count, number of unique values, earliest and latest date, count of missing values and data type. **Signs of High Risk**: There could be signs of high risk or failure when a substantial number of missing values is observed in the descriptive statistics results. It signals potential issues regarding data collection, integrity, and quality. Other red signals could include seeing inappropriate distributions for numerical variables (like having negative values for a variable that should always be positive), or finding inappropriate data types (like a continuous variable encoded as a categorical type). **Strengths**: This metric provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset. It not only gives a snapshot into the essence of the numerical, categorical, and datetime fields respectively but also identifies potential data quality issues such as missing values or inconsistencies which are crucial for building credible machine learning models. The metadata, notably the data type and missing value information, are vital for anyone including data scientists dealing with the dataset before the modeling process. **Limitations**: However, the limitations of this metric include not performing any deeper statistical analysis or tests on the data. It doesn't handle issues such as outliers, or relationships between variables. It does not offer insights into potential correlations or possible interactions between variables. It also stays silent on the potential impact of missing values on the performance of the machine learning models. Furthermore, it doesn’t investigate potential transformation requirements that may be necessary to enhance the performance of the chosen algorithm.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row90_col2" class="data row90 col2">**Purpose**: The primary role of the `AutoMA` metric is to automatically determine the optimal Moving Average (MA) order for each variable in the time series dataset. The decision of MA order is based on minimizing BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) and AIC (Akaike Information Criterion); both are statistical tools for model choice. Before the fitting process begins, a stationarity test (Augmented Dickey-Fuller test) is conducted on each series. **Test Mechanism**: First, the `AutoMA` algorithm checks whether the `max_ma_order` parameter is provided. It then loops over all variables in the dataset, performing the Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity. For each variable (if stationary), it fits an ARIMA model for orders running from 0 to `max_ma_order`. The output is a list showing BIC and AIC values of the ARIMA models with different orders. For each variable, the MA order that offers the smallest BIC is selected as the *best MA order*. The final results include a table summarizing the auto MA analysis and a table listing the best MA order for each variable. **Signs of High Risk**: - If a series is non-stationary (p-value&gt;0.05 in the Dickey-Fuller test), the result might be inaccurate. - Any error while fitting the ARIMA models, especially with higher MA order, could indicate possible risks and might require further investigation. **Strengths**: - This metric is beneficial for automating the selection process of the MA order for time series forecasting, thus saving time and effort usually required in manual hyperparameter tuning. - It applies both BIC and AIC, enhancing the chance of selecting the most suitable model. - It checks for stationarity of the series prior to model fitting, ensuring that the underlying assumptions of the MA model are met. **Limitations**: - If the time series is not stationary, the metric would provide inaccurate results. This limitation necessitates pre-processing steps to stabilize the series before ARIMA model fitting. - This metric uses a rudimentary model selection approach based on BIC and does not consider other possible model selection strategies, which might be more appropriate depending on the specific dataset. - The 'max_ma_order' parameter must be manually set, which may not always guarantee the best performance, especially if set too low. - The computation time raises with the increase in `max_ma_order`, thus the metric can be computationally expensive for larger values.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row91_col2" class="data row91 col2">**Purpose**: The purpose of the UniqueRows test is to assess the quality of the data that is being fed into the ML model, specifically by checking that the number of unique rows in the dataset exceeds a certain threshold in order to ensure diversity in the data. This is important as having a diverse range of data is crucial in training an unbiased and robust model that performs well on unseen data. **Test Mechanism**: The testing mechanism first calculates the total number of rows in the dataset. Then, for each column in the dataset, the number of unique rows is counted. The test passes if the percentage of unique rows (calculated as the number of unique rows divided by the total number of rows) is less than the predefined minimum percent threshold provided as a parameter to the function. The results are then cached, and an overall pass or fail is issued based on whether all columns have passed the test. **Signs of High Risk**: Signs of high risk include columns of data where the number of unique rows is less than the predefined minimum percent threshold. This lack of diversity in the data can be seen as an indicator of poor data quality, which could potentially lead to model overfitting and a poor generalization ability, thereby posing a high risk. **Strengths**: The Strengths of the UniqueRows test include its ability to quickly and efficiently evaluate the diversity of data across each column in the dataset. It allows an easy and systematic way to check data quality in terms of uniqueness, which can be a critical aspect in creating an effective and unbiased ML model. **Limitations**: One limitation of the UniqueRows test is that it assumes that the quality of the data is directly proportional to its uniqueness, which may not always be the case. There might be scenarios where certain non-unique rows are important and shouldn't be discounted. Also, it doesn’t take into account the 'importance' of each column in predicting the output and treats all columns equally. Finally, this test will not be useful or appropriate for categorical variables where the number of unique categories is naturally limited.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row92_col2" class="data row92 col2">**Purpose**: The 'TooManyZeroValues' test is used to identify numerical columns in the data that have an abundance of zero values. If a column has too many zeros, it could indicate data sparsity or potential lack of variation, which may limit its utility in a machine learning model. The test quantifies 'too many' as a percentage of total values, set by default to 3%. **Test Mechanism**: The application of this test involves iterating over each column of the dataset and determining if the column corresponds to numerical data. When a numeric column is identified, the function calculates the total count of zero values and their ratio to the total row number. If the proportion exceeds the preset threshold parameter (default 0.03 or 3%), the column fails the test. The results from each column are summarised in a report that indicates the number and the percentage of zero values for each numeric column, along with whether the column passed or failed the test. **Signs of High Risk**: The indicators of high risk associated with this test include: 1. Numeric columns with a high ratio of zero values to the total number of rows (beyond the set threshold). 2. Columns where all values registered are zero, implying a complete lack of data variation. **Strengths**: This test offers several advantages: 1. Helps in identifying columns with excessive zero values which otherwise might go unnoticed in a large dataset. 2. Offers flexibility to adjust the threshold of what counts as 'too many' zero values, accommodating the specific needs of a given analysis or model. 3. Reports both the count and percentage of zero values, shedding more light on the distribution and proportion of zeros within a column. 4. Focuses specifically on numerical data, preventing the misapplication to non-numerical columns and avoiding false test failures. **Limitations**: Certain limitation of this metric include: 1. It merely checks for zero values and does not assess the relevance or the impact of other potentially problematic values in the dataset such as extremely high or extremely low numbers, null values or outliers. 2. It cannot detect a pattern of zeros, which might be important in time series or longitudinal data. 3. Zeroes might be meaningful in certain contexts, so labelling them as 'too many' could be a misinterpretation of the data. 4. This test does not account for the dataset’s context and disregards that for certain columns, a high presence of zero values could be normal and does not necessarily indicate low data quality. 5. Cannot evaluate non-numerical or categorical columns, that might carry different types of concerns or issues.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row93_col2" class="data row93 col2">**Purpose**: The Pearson Correlation test is intended to measure the linear relationship between features in the dataset, specifically ensuring that the pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients do not surpass a certain threshold. High correlation between two variables might indicate redundancy or multicollinearity. Identifying such correlations can alert the risk management team or developers about issues in the dataset which may have an impact on the performance and interpretability of the Machine Learning model. **Test Mechanism**: This Python implementation of the test first generates pairwise Pearson correlations for all the features in the dataset. It then sorts these correlations and eliminates duplicate and self-correlations (where a feature is correlated with itself). A Pass or Fail is assigned based on whether the absolute value of the correlation coefficient exceeds a predefined threshold (default to 0.3). The top 10 strongest correlations, regardless of whether they pass or fail, are returned. **Signs of High Risk**: The presence of correlation coefficients exceeding the specified threshold indicates high risk. This means that the features share a strong linear relationship, leading to potential multicollinearity and model overfitting. Redundancy of variables can undermine the interpretability of the model because it’s unclear which variable's predictive power is true. **Strengths**: - The Pearson Correlation test is a simple and fast way to identify pairwise relationships between features. - Provides clear output: Results show the pairs of correlated variables along with their Pearson correlation coefficient and a Pass or Fail status. - Helps in early identification of potential multicollinearity issues which can impact model training. **Limitations**: - Limited to linear relationships only: Pearson correlation cannot depict non-linear relationships or dependencies. - Sensitive to outliers: A few outliers can significantly change the correlation coefficient. - Redundancy identification only possible for pairwise correlation: If three or more variables are linearly dependent, this method might not identify that complex relationship. - Top 10 result limitation: It only keeps the top 10 high correlations, which might not fully capture the data's complexity. Configuration for the number of kept results needs to be implemented.</td>

These plots provide valuable insights about the data correlation over a period of time. The ACF plots the correlation of the series with its own lags, while the PACF plots correlations after removing the effects already explained by earlier lags. This helps in identifying the nature of the trend (for example, seasonality), degree of autocorrelation, and selecting order parameters for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. **Test Mechanism**: The python class `ACFandPACFPlot` receives a dataset with a time-based index. After checking that the index is of datetime type and dealing with any NaN values, it generates ACF and PACF plots for each column in the dataset, creating a subplot for each. In case the dataset does not include key columns, an error is thrown. **Signs of High Risk**: An indication of model risk in relation to the ACF and PACF plot test includes sudden drops in the correlation at a specific lag or consistent high correlation across multiple lags. Both could indicate non-stationarity in the data, which might suggest that the model estimated on this data might not generalize well to future data. **Strengths**: The ACF and PACF plots provide clear graphical representations of the correlation in time series data. This is particularly useful for identifying important characteristics such as seasonality, trends, and correlation patterns within the data. This allows for better model configuration, more specifically in the selection of parameters for ARIMA models. **Limitations**: ACF and PACF plots can only be used with time series data, and are thus not applicable to every ML model. Additionally, they require a large and consistent dataset, as gaps can lead to misleading results. These plots only show linear correlation, ignoring potential nonlinear relationships. Lastly, they may not be intuitive for non-experts to interpret and are not a substitute for more advanced analyses.</td>

By presenting bivariate histograms, the metric assists in assessing correlations between variables and distributions within each defined target class, giving us intuitive insights into the data's traits and potential patterns. **Test Mechanism**: The BivariateHistograms module requires an input dataset and a set of feature pairs. For each pair of features in the dataset, a bivariate histogram is drawn using seaborn's histogram plotting function. This histogram separates the data by the status of the target column, optionally restricted to a specific status by the *target_filter* parameter. The module creates two histograms for each pair - one for each variable, where colors distinguish between different target statuses. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk signs would be irregular or unexpected distributions of data among categories. For instance, extremely skewed distributions, differing significantly from normal or expected distributions, or large discrepancies in distribution patterns between different target states, might all be reasons for concern. **Strengths**: The key strength of this test lies in its simplicity and visualization power. It provides a quick, consolidated view of data distributions across different target conditions for each variable pair, highlighting potential correlations and patterns. This can be instrumental in detecting anomalies, understanding feature interactions, and driving exploratory data analysis. **Limitations**: This metric's limitations are inherent in its simplicity. The use of histograms might not be effective in identifying complex patterns or detailed intricacies in the data. There could also be an issue of overplotting with larger datasets. Additionally, this test only works with categorical data and may not provide useful insights for numerical or continuous variables. Also, the interpretation of the visual results depends a lot on the expertise of the observer.</td>

The test generates binned groups of values from each feature in a dataset, computes the WoE value and the IV value for each bin. These values provide insights on the relationship between each feature and the target variable and their contribution towards the predictive output of the model. **Test Mechanism**: The metric leverages the `scorecardpy.woebin` method to perform WoE based automatic binning on the dataset. Depending on the parameter `breaks_adj`, the method adjusts the cut-off points for binning numeric variables. The bins are then used to calculate the WoE and IV. The metric requires a dataset with the target variable defined. The metric outputs a dataframe that comprises the bin boundaries, WoE, and IV values for each feature. **Signs of High Risk**: Indicators of high risk associated with this metric might include high IV values, which denote variables with too much predictive power which might lead to overfitting. Another sign of risk could be errors during the binning process, which might be due to inappropriate data types or poorly defined bins. **Strengths**: The WoE and IV test is highly effective for feature selection in binary classification problems, as it quantifies how much predictive information is packed within each feature regarding the binary outcome. Furthermore, the WoE transformation creates a monotonic relationship between the target and independent variables. **Limitations**: This method is mainly designed for binary classification tasks, therefore it might not be applicable or reliable for multi-class classification or regression tasks. Additionally, if the dataset has many features or the features are not binnable or they are non-numeric, this process might encounter difficulties. Furthermore, this metric doesn't help in identifying if the predictive factor being observed is a coincidence or a real phenomenon due to data randomness.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row97_col2" class="data row97 col2">**Purpose:** The HeatmapFeatureCorrelations metric is utilized to evaluate the degree of interrelationships between pairs of input features within a dataset. This metric allows us to visually comprehend the correlation patterns through a heatmap, which can be essential in understanding which features may contribute most significantly to the performance of the model. Features that have high intercorrelation can potentially reduce the model's ability to learn, thus impacting the overall performance and stability of the machine learning model. **Test Mechanism:** The metric executes the correlation test by computing the Pearson correlations for all pairs of numerical features. It then generates a heatmap plot using seaborn, a Python data visualization library. The colormap ranges from -1 to 1, indicating perfect negative correlation and perfect positive correlation respectively. A 'declutter' option is provided which, if set to true, removes variable names and numerical correlations from the plot to provide a more streamlined view. The size of feature names and correlation coefficients can be controlled through 'fontsize' parameters. **Signs of High Risk:** Indicators of potential risk include features with high absolute correlation values. Since this suggests a significant degree of multicollinearity, it might lead to instabilities in the trained model and can also result in overfitting. Furthermore, the presence of multiple homogeneous blocks of high positive or negative correlation within the plot might indicate redundant or irrelevant features included within the dataset. **Strengths:** The strength of this metric lies in its ability to visually represent the extent and direction of correlation between any two numeric features, which aids in the interpretation and understanding of complex data relationships. The heatmap provides an immediate and intuitively understandable representation, hence, it is extremely useful for high-dimensional datasets where extracting meaningful relationships might be challenging. **Limitations:** The central limitation might be that it can only calculate correlation between numeric features, making it unsuitable for categorical variables unless they are already numerically encoded in a meaningful manner. Also, it uses Pearson's correlation, which only measures linear relationships between features. It may perform poorly in cases where the relationship is non-linear. Moreover, large feature sets might result in cluttered and difficult-to-read correlation heatmaps, especially when the 'declutter' option is set to false.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row98_col2" class="data row98 col2">**Purpose**: The TimeSeriesFrequency test is designed to evaluate the consistency in the frequency of data points in a time series dataset. The metric inspects the intervals or duration between each data point in the dataset and helps to determine if there is a fixed pattern (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly). This is important in time-series analysis, as irregularities in the data frequency can lead to erroneous results or may affect the model's ability to identify trends and patterns. **Test Mechanism**: The test examines the dataframe index to verify that it's in datetime format. Afterwards, it identifies the frequency of each data series in the dataframe by employing pandas' `infer_freq` method, which infers the frequency of a given time series. It returns the frequency string as well as a dictionary that matches frequency strings to their respective labels. The frequencies of all variables in the dataset are then compared. If they all share one common frequency, the test passes; otherwise, it fails. A frequency plot that graphically depicts the time differences between consecutive entries in the dataframe index is also generated using Plotly. **Signs of High Risk**: One significant sign of high risk is if the test fails, i.e., when there are multiple unique frequencies in the dataset. This could indicate irregular time intervals between observations, which could disrupt pattern recognition or trend analysis that the model is designed to conduct. Also, missing or null frequencies can signify data inconsistencies or gaps in the data collection process. **Strengths**: This test provides a systematic way to check and visually represent the consistency of data frequency in a time series dataset. It increases reliability of the model by asserting that the timing and consistency of the observations are in line with the requirements of time series analysis. The visual plot generated provides an intuitive representation of the dataset's frequency distribution, catering to visual learners and aiding explanation and interpretation. **Limitations**: This test is restricted to time-series datasets; hence, it is not applicable to all kinds of datasets. Moreover, the `infer_freq` method may not always infer the correct frequency in the presence of missing or irregular data points. Lastly, in some cases, mixed frequencies might be acceptable depending on the context or the model being developed, but this test considers them a failing condition.</td>

The main purpose is to assess whether the model's datasets are split appropriately, as an imbalanced split might affect the model's ability to learn from the data and generalize to unseen data. **Test Mechanism:** The DatasetSplit test first calculates the total size of all available datasets in the model. Then, for each individual dataset, the methodology involves determining the size of the dataset and its proportion relative to the total size. The results are then conveniently summarized in a table that shows dataset names, sizes, and proportions. Absolute size and proportion of the total dataset size are displayed for each individual dataset. **Signs of High Risk:** High risk signals include: 1. A very small training dataset, which may result in the model not learning enough from the data. 2. A very large training dataset and a small test dataset, which may lead to model overfitting and poor generalization to unseen data. 3.

The metric is not tied to any specific data type and is applicable to tabular data, time series data, or text data. **Limitations:** 1. The DatasetSplit test does not provide any insight into the quality or diversity of the data within each split, just the size and proportion. 2. The test does not give any recommendations or adjustments for imbalanced datasets. 3. Potential lack of compatibility with more complex modes of data splitting (for example, stratified or time-based splits) could limit the applicability of this test.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row100_col2" class="data row100 col2">**Purpose**: The purpose of the SpreadPlot metric is to visually explore and understand the relationships between pairs of time series variables in the given dataset. This understanding aids in identifying and assessing potential time series relationships, such as cointegration, between variables. **Test Mechanism**: The test mechanism for this metric involves calculating and plotting the spread between each pair of time series variables in the dataset. More specifically, the difference between two variables is computed and then plotted as a line graph. This process is repeated for all unique pairs of variables in the dataset. **Signs of High Risk**: Signs of high risk related to this metric include the presence of large fluctuations in the spread over time, unexpected patterns, or trends that might signal a potential risk in the underlying relationships between the variables. Also, the presence of significant missing data or extreme outlier values could potentially distort the spread, indicating a high risk. **Strengths**: The key strengths of using the SpreadPlot metric include: 1. Enables detailed visual inspection and interpretation of the relationships between time-series pairs. 2. Facilitates uncovering complex relationships like cointegration. 3. Enhances interpretability by visualizing the relationships, aiding in identifying outliers and trends. 4. Capable of handling multiple variable pairs from a dataset with a flexible and adaptable process. **Limitations**: Despite its strengths, the SpreadPlot metric also comes with certain limitations: 1. It's primarily a visualization tool and does not provide quantitative measurements or statistics to objectively assess relationships. 2. Highly dependent on the quality and granularity of the data – missing data or outliers can significantly affect the interpretation of the relationships. 3. Can become inefficient or challenging to interpret with a large number of variables due to the large number of plots. 4. Might not fully capture complex non-linear relationships between variables.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row101_col2" class="data row101 col2">**1. Purpose**: The "TimeSeriesLinePlot" metric is designed to generate and analyze time series data visual plots for model performance inspection purposes. This analysis manifests as line plots that represent various time series in the dataset. By visual plotting, the metric helps in the initial data inspection, which gives a sense of patterns, trends, seasonality, irregularity, and any anomalies that might occur over time in the given dataset. **2. Test Mechanism**: This Python class extracts the column names from the input dataset and iteratively generates line plots for each column. The Python library 'Plotly' is used for creating the line plots. For every column (representing a time series), a plot's time-series values are generated against the dataset's datetime index. Indexes that are not of datetime type will trigger a ValueError. **3. Signs of High Risk**: Red flags that could denote potential high risk scenarios include: * Time-series data lacking datetime indices * Non-existence of provided columns in the dataset * Anomalous patterns or irregularities seen in time-series plots indicating high model instability or predictive error potential **4. Strengths**: This metric comes with several favourable assets: * It succinctly visualizes complex time series data, facilitating easier interpretation and detection of temporal trends, patterns and anomalies. * It is highly adaptable and capable of functioning well with multiple time series within the same dataset. * By visual inspection, it allows the detection of anomalies and irregular patterns that could indicate a potential issue with the data or model performance. **5. Limitations**: Despite its numerous advantages, the metric has a few limitations: * The effectiveness of this metric relies heavily on the quality and patterns of the input time series data. * It's solely a visual inspection tool and does not provide quantitative measurement. This can be a disadvantage when the aim is to compare and rank multiple models or when precise, numeric diagnostics are required. * It assumes that the time specific data has already been transformed into a datetime index and requires the input data to be formatted appropriately. * It inherently lacks the ability to extract any deeper statistical insights from the time series data, making it less effective when dealing with complex data structures and phenomena.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row102_col2" class="data row102 col2">**Purpose**: The PiT (Point in Time) Credit Scores Histogram metric is used to assess the performance of a classification model with a focus on credit risk evaluation. It visualizes the distributions of observed and predicted default scores and provides an intuitive comparison allowing for quick model assessment. **Test Mechanism**: This metric leverages histograms to illustrate the differences in score distributions for both observed and predicted results. It separates the scores into defaulted (1) and not defaulted (0) and makes a histogram for each of these categories. The model compares the distributions of observed and predicted classifications simultaneously, furnishing a clear idea about how well the model can predict the credit risk. **Signs of High Risk**: If the observed and predicted histograms are significantly different, there may be risk factors that the model is not adequately addressing. Additionally, if the predicted defaults are concentrated towards one end of the graph or are less evenly distributed than the observed scores, this could indicate potential issues with how the model is understanding the data or predicting outcomes. **Strengths**: This metric provides an intuitive visual representation of model performance which can be easily understood and interpreted even without extensive technical background. By comparing the distributions of observed and predicted scores, it gives a clear picture about the model's ability in distinguishing between defaulting and non-defaulting entities. It's especially tailored for credit risk assessment models and the PiT element takes into consideration time evolution of credit risk. **Limitations**: This visual method may not provide accurate enough information for detailed statistical analysis and doesn't give precise, quantifiable measures of model performance. It relies on manual inspection and comparison, making it subjective to human bias and potentially less reliable for catching subtle discrepancies. Furthermore, this method doesn't work well when the score distributions overlap significantly or when there are too many scores to be plotted, resulting in cluttered or hard-to-read graphs.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row103_col2" class="data row103 col2">**Purpose:** The AutoSeasonality metric is intended to automatically detect and determine the optimal seasonal order or period for each variable in a time series dataset. The aim here is to quantify the inherent periodic pattern and seasonality that recurs after fixed intervals of time in the dataset. This is especially crucial for forecasting-based models, where understanding the seasonality component of the series can substantially enhance prediction accuracy. **Test Mechanism:** The implementation uses the seasonal decomposition method from Statsmodels Python library, broken down into 'additive' model type for each variable within the defined range of 'min_period' and 'max_period'. The test applies the seasonal decompose function to each seasonality period in the range and calculates the mean residual error for each period. The seasonal period that minimizes these residual errors is selected as the 'Best Period'. The results include the 'Best Period', along with the calculated residual errors and the determination of 'Seasonality' or 'No Seasonality'. **Signs of High Risk:** The following factors may indicate high risk or failure in the model's performance: - If the optimal seasonal period or 'Best Period' is consistently at the maximum or minimum limit of the provided range for a majority of variables, this might signify that the specified range doesn't adequately capture the true seasonality of the series. - A high average 'Residual Error' for the 'Best Period' could imply issues with the performance of the model. **Strengths:** This metric offers several advantages for time series dataset analysis: - It provides a robust, automated approach to identifying and quantifying the optimal seasonality. - It is applicable to multiple variables in a dataset, offering a comprehensive assessment of each variable's seasonality. - It uses concrete and measurable statistical methods to derive seasonality, enhancing the objectivity and reproducibility of the model. **Limitations:** There are also a few limitations of this metric: - Errors may arise if the time series exhibits random walk behaviour or lacks a clear seasonality, as the seasonal decomposition model may not be appropriate. - The defined range for the seasonal period (min_period and max_period) can influence the results. If the true seasonality period lies outside this range, this approach will not be able to identify the actual seasonality. - It may not fully interpret complex patterns that go beyond the simple additive model for seasonal decomposition. - The tool may infer seasonality where none exists if random fluctuations in the data match the defined seasonal period range.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row104_col2" class="data row104 col2">**Purpose**: This metric is intended for visual inspection and monitoring of relationships between pairs of variables in a machine learning model targeting classification tasks. It is especially useful for understanding how predictor variables (features) behave in relation to each other and how they are distributed for different classes of the target variable, which could inform feature selection, model-building strategies, and even alert to possible biases and irregularities in the data. **Test Mechanism**: This metric operates by creating a scatter plot for each pair of the selected features in the dataset. If the parameters "features_pairs" are not specified, an error will be thrown. The metric offers flexibility by allowing the user to filter on a specific target class - specified by the "target_filter" parameter - for more granified insights. Each scatterplot is then color-coded based on the category of the target variable for better visual differentiation. The seaborn scatterplot library is used for generating the plots. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk indicators in this context would be related to visual patterns which might suggest non-linear relationships, substantial skewness, multicollinearity, clustering, or isolated outlier points in the scatter plot. Such issues could affect the assumptions and performance of some models, especially the ones assuming linearity like linear regression or logistic regression. **Strengths**: Scatterplots are simple and intuitive for users to understand, providing a visual tool to pinpoint complex relationships between two variables. It helps in outlier detection, identification of variable associations and trends, including non-linear patterns which can be overlooked by other linear-focused metrics or tests. The implementation also supports visualizing binary or multi-class classification datasets. **Limitations**: Scatterplots are limited to bivariate analysis - the relationship of two variables at a time - and might not reveal the full picture in higher dimensions or where interactions are present. They also are not ideal for very large datasets as points will overlap and render the visualization less informative. Further, scatterplots are more of an exploratory tool rather than a formal statistical test, so they don't provide any quantitative measure of model quality or performance. Interpretation of scatterplots relies heavily on the domain knowledge and judgment of the viewer, which can introduce subjective bias.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row105_col2" class="data row105 col2">**Purpose**: The purpose of this metric is to use the Engle-Granger test to examine for cointegration between pairs of time series variables in a given dataset. This can be beneficial for assessing the extent to which two time series variables move together over time. Predictive regressions can be substantially more accurate if the variables involved are co-integrated. **Test Mechanism**: This test first prepares the input dataset by dropping any non-applicable values. It then iterates pairs of variables, applying the Engle-Granger cointegration test to each pair. The test yield a 'p' value, which is then compared to a pre-set threshold to determine whether the corresponding variables are cointegrated or not. If the 'p' value is less than or equal to the threshold, the decision is 'Cointegrated', if not, 'Not cointegrated'. The metric returns a summary table of the cointegration results for each pair of time series variables. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk can be indicated if a large number of variables that are expected to be cointegrated fail the test. Also, if a significant number of 'p' values obtained are near the threshold, it also poses a risk as minor data variations can skew the decision between 'Cointegrated' and 'Not cointegrated'. **Strengths**: This test is a powerful method for analysing the relationship between time series, particularly when it's important to know whether variables are moving together in a statistically significant manner. Objectively evaluating such relationships can drive better forecasting in many domains, especially in finance or economics where prediction models often depend on understanding how different variables move together over time. **Limitations**: Cointegration tests, such as the Engle-Granger, often assume that time series are integrated of the same order, which is not always true in multi-variate time series datasets. Non-stationary characteristics in the series or the presence of structural breaks might give falsely positive or negative cointegration results. Additionally, the method doesn't work very well with small sample sizes due to a lack of power. Thus, the test must be used with caution, and where possible, corroborated with other predictive indicators.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row106_col2" class="data row106 col2">**Purpose**: This test is designed to verify that the number of missing values in a historical time-series dataset is below a specified threshold. Since time-series models rely on continuity and temporality of data points, missing values could affect the model's performance. Therefore, this test intends to maintain data quality and readiness for the machine learning model. **Test Mechanism**: The test process begins by checking if the dataset has a datetime index; if not, an error is raised. Next, a lower limit threshold for missing values is set and a missing values check is run on each column of the dataset, with a test result object being generated whether the number of missing values is below the specified threshold. The percentage of missing values is also calculated alongside the raw count. As a visualization aid, the test generates two plots (a bar plot and a heatmap) to better illustrate the distribution and quantity of missing values per variable, if any exist. The test results, missing values count, missing values percentage, and the pass/fail status are returned in a results table. **Signs of High Risk**: If any column in the dataset contains a number of missing values exceeding the threshold, it is considered a failure and a high-risk scenario. This could be due to incomplete data collection, faulty sensors, or data preprocessing errors. A continuous visual 'streak' in the 'heatmap' might also indicate a systematic error during data collection. **Strengths**: This test is beneficial in promptly identifying missing values which might impact the model's performance. It is broadly applicable and customizable through the threshold parameter. Going beyond raw numbers to calculate the percentile of missing values adds a more relative understanding of data scarcity. It also includes a robust mechanism to visually represent data quality, facilitating quicker and friendlier misinterpretation. **Limitations**: Though the test effectively identifies missing values, it does not suggest methods to deal with them. It assumes that the dataset should have datetime index, limiting its use to time series analysis only. The test is sensitive to the 'min_threshold' parameter and might raise false alarms if it's set too strictly, or might miss problematic data if it's set too loosely. Lastly, the test solely focuses on 'missingness' and might overlook other aspects of data quality.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row107_col2" class="data row107 col2">**Purpose**: The main objective of the `DatasetMetadata` test is to gather and log crucial descriptive statistics about the datasets used during model training. It serves as an important tool for monitoring relevant characteristics of the dataset, such as task types (classification, regression, text_classification, text_summarization) and tags (tabular_data, time_series_data, text_data). This helps ensure that model validation exercises are conducted with full transparency and context by connecting different metrics and test results to the underlying dataset. **Test Mechanism**: This class does not include a specific test or grading scale. Instead, it collects metadata associated with the dataset and logs it for future reference. The metadata is attached to the dataset object during the post-initialization phase. The `run` method initializes a `TestSuiteDatasetResult` object with a unique result ID and dataset. The dataset metadata then gets associated with this ID for future use in more targeted validation efforts. **Signs of High Risk**: The risks associated with this process are not connected with model performance or biases. However, incomplete metadata, incorrect dataset labels, or missing dataset types could lead to inaccuracies in model risk assessment and may constitute signs of risk within the metadata gathering process itself. **Strengths**: A key strength of this class is the transparency it brings to model validation exercises by providing detailed information about the dataset. This can help in diagnosing errors, identifying correlations to the model's behavior, ensuring correct task and data-type associations, and enabling superior model explanations. Also, it can support dataset versioning by logging each dataset's metadata, offering a trackable history of changes. **Limitations**: The `DatasetMetadata` class could lack completeness or accuracy, particularly if metadata is not adequately added or is incorrect. The process does not inherently evaluate the quality of the dataset or directly validate the model's predictions, so it must be combined with other tests for a comprehensive evaluation. Lastly, any potential bias in the dataset won't be recognized using this class. Bias detection would require separate tests tailored specifically towards fairness and bias detection.</td>

The goal is to evaluate the distribution of values in the dataset over a given time period, typically for regression tasks. Internet traffic, stock prices, weather data etc. could be time series data. Histograms provide insights into the data’s underlying probability distribution, skewness, peakness(kurtosis) etc. **Test Mechanism**: The test requires a dataset column that must have a datetime type index. It iterates over each column in the provided dataset and generates a histogram using Seaborn's histplot function. If the dataset contains more than one time-series (i.e., more than one column with datetime type index), a separate histogram will be plotted for each. Additionally, a kernel density estimate (KDE) line is drawn for each histogram to indicate the data's underlying probability distribution. The x and y-axis labels are hidden to only focus on the data distribution. **Signs of High Risk**: - The dataset does not contain a column with a datetime type index. - The specified columns do not exist in the dataset. - The distribution of data in the histogram exhibits high skewness or kurtosis, which might induce biases in the model. - Presence of outliers that are far from the main data distribution. **Strengths**: - Provides a visual diagnostic tool, which is a good starting point to understand the overall behavior and distribution trends of the dataset. - Works well for both single and multiple time series data analysis. - The Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) line offers a smooth estimate of the overall trend in data distribution. **Limitations**: - It only provides a high-level overview of data distribution and does not provide specific numeric measures of skewness, kurtosis, etc. - It doesn’t show the precise data values and the actual data is grouped into bins, hence some detail is inherently lost (precision vs. general overview trade-off). - Can't handle non-numeric data columns. - The shape of the histogram can be sensitive to the number of bins used.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row109_col2" class="data row109 col2">**Purpose**: This LaggedCorrelationHeatmap metric is designed to evaluate and visualize the correlation between the target variable and certain delayed copies (lags) of independent variables in a time-series based dataset. This metric aids in uncovering relationships in time-series data where the influence of an input feature on the target variable may not be immediate but occurs after a certain period (lags). **Test Mechanism**: Python's Pandas library is used in conjunction with Plotly to perform computations and generate the heatmap. The target variable and corresponding independent variables are taken from the dataset. Subsequently, lags of independent variables are generated and the correlation between these lagged variables and the target are calculated. The calculated correlations are stored in a matrix that has variables on one axis and the number of lags on the other. This correlation matrix is then visualized as a heatmap, where different color intensities represent the strength of the correlation, making patterns easier to spot. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk associated with this metric may be indicated by insignificant correlations throughout the heatmap or by correlations that break intuition or prior knowledge, indicating potential issues with the data or model. **Strengths**: This metric offers an excellent way to explore and visualize the time-dependent relationships between features and the target variable in a time-series dataset. By looking at correlations with lagged features, it is possible to identify delayed effects that may go unnoticed with more traditional correlation measures. As it's visually represented, the heatmaps are a very intuitive way to present time dependent correlations and influence. **Limitations**: The LaggedCorrelationHeatmap metric has a few limitations. It assumes linear relationships between the variables, meaning relationships that aren't linear may go undetected. As it only considers linear correlation, it may miss out on complex nonlinear interactions. This metric works only with time-series data and would not be applicable for other types of data. Also, the choice of number of lags used can also affect the results; whilst too many lags can make the heatmap hard to interpret and less useful, too few might miss delayed effects. Furthermore, this metric does not consider any causal relationship, it merely presents the correlation.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row110_col2" class="data row110 col2">**Purpose**: This test utilizes the Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series by Loess (STL) method to break down a dataset into its fundamental components: observed, trend, seasonal, and residuals. The main purpose of this method is to identify any hidden or non-intuitive patterns and ascertain certain attributes such as seasonality in the dataset's features, helping to understand and validate the dataset further. **Test Mechanism**: The test uses the seasonal_decompose function from the statsmodels.tsa.seasonal library to assess each feature in the dataset. The seasonal_decompose function breaks down each analyzed feature into four components: observed, trend, seasonal, and residuals. It generates graphical representations, essentially six subplot graphs for each feature, to visually interpret the results. The Seasonal Decompose test also includes a verification step to identify and exclude non-finite values before the seasonal decomposition. **Signs of High Risk**: Signs of high risk associated with this test include: - Non-finiteness: Having too many non-finite values in a dataset might imply a high risk since these values are excluded before performing the seasonal decomposition. - Frequent Warnings: Issue warnings when the test fails to infer frequency for a contested feature. - High Seasonality: If the seasonal component is significantly high, forecasts might be highly unreliable due to excessive seasonal changes. **Strengths**: Strengths of this metric test include: - Ability to Detect Seasonality: This code excels in detecting hidden seasonality patterns within features of datasets. - Visualization: This test provides visualizations, making it easier to interpret and comprehend. - Works with Any Regression Model: It does not restrict its applicability to any specific regression model, ensuring wider usability. **Limitations**: Limitations of this method include: - Dependencies on Assumptions: The test assumes that features in the dataset have a certain frequency. If no frequency could be inferred for a variable, that feature will be excluded from analysis. - Handling of Non-finite Values: The test excludes non-finite values during the analysis which could lead to incomplete representation or understanding of the dataset. - Not Reliable for Noisy Datasets: This test may generate unreliable results in the presence of heavy noise.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row111_col2" class="data row111 col2">**Purpose**: The purpose of this test is to perform a visual analysis of the Weight of Evidence (WoE) and Information Value (IV) for categorical variables in a provided dataset. This aids in understanding the predictive power of each variable in a classification-based machine learning model by displaying the data distribution over the different categories of each feature. WoE and IV are common metric in credit scoring models and provide reliable statistical measures for variables' predictive power. **Test Mechanism**: The test mechanism proceeds in predefined steps. It first selects non-numeric columns and converts them to string type for proper binning. Afterward, it performs an automatic WoE binning on the selected features in the dataset, which effectively groups the possible values of a variable into bins or categories. Once this is done, the function generates two visual charts for each variable - a Bar chart for IV and a Scatter chart for WoE values. These visualizations are rendered based on the distribution of the respective metric across the different categories of each feature. **Signs of High Risk**: Indicators of high potential risk include an error occurring during the binning process or issues converting non-numeric columns to string data type. Furthermore, an uneven distribution of WoE and IV, especially if certain bins dominate others significantly, might indicate that the model is excessively relying on certain variables or categories for predictions, which could have an adverse impact on the model's generalizability and robustness. **Strengths**: One of the strengths of using this metric is that it provides a detailed visual presentation of how feature categories relate to the target variable, giving an intuitive understanding of the feature's contribution to the model. It also allows easy identification of highly impacting features, which can aid in feature selection and in understanding the decision logic of the model. Furthermore, WoE transformations are monotonic, meaning they preserve the rank ordering of the original data points, which simplifies subsequent analyses. **Limitations**: One of the limitations of this method is that it is largely dependent on the binning process. An inappropriate choice of the number of bins or the binning thresholds can lead to an inadequate representation of the variable's distribution. Also, this method is most suitable for categorical data; encoding continuous variables to categorical might sometimes lead to loss of information. Another limitation is that extreme or outlier values can have a significant impact on WoE and IV calculation. Finally, it requires sufficient events per bin in order to give reliable information value and weight of evidence.</td>

Particularly, this method is geared towards ensuring that the classes are not too skewed, which could bias the predictions of the model. It is important to have a balanced dataset for training to avoid biased model with high accuracy for the majority class and low accuracy for the minority class. **Test Mechanism**: The ClassImbalance test functions by determining the frequency (in percentage proportion) of each class in the target column of the dataset and checks whether each class appears in at least a particular minimum percentage of the total records. This minimum percentage is a parameter that can be pre-set or changed according to requirements; the default value in this case is set to 10%. **Signs of High Risk**: Any class that constitutes less than the preset minimum percentage threshold is flagged as a high risk, indicating potential class imbalance. The function provides a pass/fail verdict for each class based on this criterion. In essence, if any class fails this test, the dataset is likely to contain an imbalanced class distribution. **Strengths**: 1. Identifies under-represented classes which can impact the performance of a machine learning model. 2. Easy and fast to compute. 3. The test is very informative as it not only detects imbalance but also quantifies the degree of imbalance. 4. Adjustable threshold allows flexibility and adaptation to varying use-cases or domain-specific requirements. 5. The test generates a visually intuitive plot showing classes and their corresponding proportions, aiding in interpretability and understanding of the data. **Limitations**: 1. The test might not perform well, or offer useful insights for datasets with too many classes. The imbalance may be inevitable due to the inherent class distribution. 2. Sensitivity to the threshold value may lead to false discrimination of imbalance when the threshold is set too high. 3. Irrespective of the percentage threshold, it does not account for different costs or impacts of misclassification of different classes, which can vary based on specific application or domain. 4.

<td id="T_9d30f_row113_col2" class="data row113 col2">**Purpose**: The InterQuartile Range Outliers Bar Plot (IQROutliersBarPlot) metric aims to visually analyse and evaluate the extent of outliers in numeric variables based on percentiles. This metric is vital for understanding data distribution, identifying abnormalities within a dataset and assessing the risk associated with processing potentially skewed data that might impact the predictive performance of the machine learning model. **Test Mechanism**: The test involves the following steps: 1. For each numeric feature, or column, in the dataset, it computes Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile), and then the Interquartile Range (IQR) which is the difference between Q3 and Q1. 2. It then calculates the thresholds for lower and upper bounds as Q1 minus `threshold` times IQR and Q3 plus `threshold` times IQR, respectively. The default `threshold` is 1.5. 3. Any value in the feature that is less than the lower bound and greater than the upper bound is considered an outlier. 4. The number of outliers are then calculated for different percentile categories like [0-25], [25-50], [50-75], [75-100]. 5. These counts are then used to prepare a bar plot for the feature showing the distribution of outliers across different percentile ranges. **Signs of High Risk**: High risk or failure in the model's performance could be indicated by: 1. Presence of large number of outliers in the data that will skew the distribution. 2. When the outliers are in higher percentiles (75-100). This indicates extreme values, which can have a more prominent impact on the model's performance. 3. Certain features having a majority of their values as outliers, meaning these features may not contribute positively to model's prediction power. **Strengths**: 1. Identifies outliers in the data visually, which is easy to understand and can help in interpreting the potential impact on the model. 2. Accommodates both total numeric features or a selected subset hence proving its flexibility. 3. Agnostic to the task type: can be used for both classification and regression tasks. 4. This metric can process large datasets as it does not rely on computationally expensive operations. **Limitations**: 1. This metric only works with numerical variables and would not be applicable to categorical variables. 2. It uses a pre-defined threshold (defaulting to 1.5) to determine what constitutes an outlier. This threshold might not be ideal for all cases. 3. This metric does not provide insights about the consequence of these outliers on the predictive performance of the models, but only presents their presence and distribution. 4. It assumes that the data is unimodal and symmetric, which may not be always the case. For non-normal distributions, the results might be misleading.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row114_col2" class="data row114 col2">**Purpose**: The PiTPDHistogram metric is used to compute the Probability of Default (PD) for each instance in both the training and test datasets in order to evaluate the model's performance in credit risk estimation. The PD is examined at a specific point in time (PiT). The resulting distributions for the actual and predicted default classes are then visualized in a histogram, making it easier to understand the model's prediction accuracy. **Test Mechanism**: This metric sorts instances into either observed (actual) or predicted default classes, with a default being represented by '1' and non-default as '0'. Using these classes, the probability of default is computed for each instance and plotted in a histogram. Two histograms are generated: one for the observed defaults and another one for the predicted defaults. If the distribution of predicted defaults closely matches the distribution of observed defaults, this would indicate good model performance. **Signs of High Risk**: Discrepancies between the two histograms (observed and predicted defaults) would suggest model risk. This may include differences in the shapes of the histograms, divergences in the spread of default probabilities, or significant mismatches in the peak default probabilities. These disparities signal that the model may not be accurately predicting defaults, which could pose a high risk especially in the field of credit risk analysis. **Strengths**: This metric excels in its visual interpretation of model performance. By comparing two histograms side by side, it allows for a convenient comparison between the observed and predicted defaults. This visualization can reveal model biases and illuminate areas where the model's performance may fall short, which might not be as evident in purely numerical evaluations or more complex visualization measures. **Limitations**: Despite its strengths, the PiTPDHistogram metric is largely interpretive and subjective. Determining risk based on visual discrepancies requires a certain level of human judgement and may vary between different analysts. If used solely, this metric might overlook other nuances in model performance that are better captured by more quantitative or diversified metrics. Furthermore, the information provided is limited to a specific point in time, which might not fully reflect the model's performance over different periods or under changing conditions.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row115_col2" class="data row115 col2">**Purpose**: The purpose of this test, referred to as AutoAR, is to automatically detect the Autoregressive (AR) order of a time series using both Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and Akaike information criterion (AIC) for regression tasks. The AR order specifies the number of previous terms in the series to use to predict the current term. The goal is to select the appropriate AR model that best captures the trend and seasonality in the time series data. **Test Mechanism**: The test iterates over a range of possible AR orders up to a specified maximum. For each order, an autoregressive model is fitted, and the BIC and AIC are computed. Both these statistical measures penalize models for complexity (higher number of parameters), favoring simpler models that fit the data well. Additionally, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test is conducted to check stationarity of the time series; non-stationary series might produce inaccurate results. The test results, including AR order, BIC, and AIC, are added into a dataframe for easy comparison. Subsequently, the AR order with minimum BIC is determined as the "best" order for each variable. **Signs of High Risk**: - If a time series is not stationary (Augmented Dickey-Fuller test p-value &gt; 0.05), it may lead to inaccurate results. - Issues with the model fitting process, such as computational or convergence problems, suggest a high risk. - If the chosen AR order is consistently at the maximum specified order, this could suggest insufficiency of the maximum set limit. **Strengths**: - The test automatically determines the optimal AR order, reducing potential bias involved in manual selection. - The method attempts to balance goodness-of-fit against model simplicity, preventing overfitting. - It factors in stationarity of the time series, essential for reliable AR modeling. - The test consolidates the results into a clear, easily interpreted table. **Limitations**: - The test requires stationary input time series. - Assumes linear relationship between the series and its lags. - Finding the best model is limited to the maximum AR order provided in the parameters. A low max_ar_order may yield suboptimal results. - AIC and BIC may not always select the same model as the best; interpretation may need to consider the goal and the trade-offs.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row116_col2" class="data row116 col2">**Purpose**: The purpose of `TabularDateTimeHistograms` metric is to visually analyze the datetime data within a given machine learning model dataset. It plots histograms for differences between consecutive dates across all datetime variables present in the dataset. This assists in the inspection and understanding of the frequency distribution of time intervals in the dataset, which can be useful in analysing patterns in the data over time. **Test Mechanism**: The test works by first extracting all the datetime columns from the dataset. For each of these datetime columns, the test then calculates the difference between consecutive dates and converts these differences into days. Zero values are filtered out to only plot data points that represent some amount of day difference. Histograms are created for each column using seaborn's histplot function and displayed with relevant labels. The histograms provide a visual representation of the frequency of occurrences of different day intervals in the dataset. **Signs of High Risk**: One high risk associated with this test is if no datetime columns are found in the data set, it would result in a ValueError. A potential sign of risk could also be a skewed or highly irregular distribution in the histogram, indicating potential issues in the data such as incorrect timestamps or anomalies. **Strengths**: The strengths of this metric include its ability to visually represent frequency distributions of time interval changes in the dataset, aiding in understanding inherent patterns. The histogram plots can also assist in identifying potential outliers and anomalies in the data, and can help assess data quality. The metric is applicable to various task types like classification, regression, and works with multiple datetime variables if available. **Limitations**: Limitations of using this metric mainly stem from its reliance on visual interpretation of the data. The metric does not provide a quantitative evaluation of the model and may not capture complexities or multidimensional patterns in data. The test can only be applied to datasets with datetime columns, and would fail in absence of them. Interpretation of the generated histograms also depends on the domain knowledge and experience of the investigator.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row117_col2" class="data row117 col2">**1. Purpose:** The main goal of the Punctuations Metric is to analyze the frequency of punctuation usage within a given text dataset. This heuristic is often used in Natural Language Processing tasks such as text classification and text summarization. **2. Test Mechanism:** The test begins by checking the input's eligibility, specifying that the "dataset" must be of a VMDataset type. The next step is to create a corpus of the dataset by splitting the text of the input dataset on spaces. Then, it tallies the usage of each unique punctuation character in the text corpus. The distribution of the frequencies of each punctuation symbol is subsequently depicted as a bar graph. Results are stored as Figures and associated with the main Punctuations object. **3. Signs of High Risk:** Given the nature of the test, risks are typically associated with the quality of text data. One sign of high risk might be an excessive or unusual frequency of certain punctuation marks, which may denote dubious quality, data corruption, or skewed data. **4. Strengths:** The primary strength of this metric is providing insights into the distribution of punctuation use in a text dataset. This could be valuable in validating the quality, consistency, and nature of data. It could also offer hints about the style or tonality of the text corpus (e.g., frequent exclamation use might signify a more informal, emotional context). **5. Limitations:** This test exclusively looks at punctuation usage and thus can overlook other crucial text characteristics. Additionally, it’s crucial not to make broad cultural or tonality assumptions based solely on punctuation distribution since these may vary widely across different languages and contexts. It may also be less effective when dealing with languages that employ non-standard or different punctuation. Finally, the visualized results may lack interpretability when there are many unique punctuation marks in the dataset.</td>

This is particularly useful for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as text classification and text summarization. **Test Mechanism**: The methodology for this test involves splitting the specified text column's entries into words and collating them into a corpus. Subsequently, the frequency of each word is counted using Counter functionality. The forty most commonly occurring words that aren't categorized as English stopwords are then visualized in a bar chart. The x-axis shows formulated words and the y-axis indicates their frequency of appearance. **Signs of High Risk**: Indicators of high risk may include a lack of distinct words within the list, or common words primarily encompassing stopwords. In addition, the frequent appearance of irrelevant or inappropriate words could indicate a poorly curated or noisy data set. Lastly, if the test returns an error due to the absence of a valid Dataset object, it signifies a high risk as it can't be effectively implemented. **Strengths**: This metric offers a clear insight into the language features – specifically, the word frequency – of unstructured text data. It can reveal prominent vocabulary and language patterns, which can be vital for effective feature extraction in NLP tasks. The visualization aspect aids in quickly capturing the patterns and getting an intuitive feel of the data. **Limitations**: This test is solely focused on word frequency and disregards semantic or context-related information. It deliberately ignores stopwords, which, in some cases, might carry important significance. Furthermore, it may only be applicable to English language text data as it uses English stopwords for filtering, and does not account for data in other languages. The metric also requires a valid Dataset object, indicating a dependency condition that limits applicability.</td>

It is particularly useful for natural language processing tasks such as text classification and text summarization. The goal is to identify common trends and patterns in the use of hashtags, which can serve as critical indicators or features within a machine learning model. **Test Mechanism**: The test implements a regular expression (regex) to extract all hashtags from the specified text column. For each hashtag found, it makes a tally of its occurrences. It then outputs a list of the top N hashtags (default is 25, but customizable), sorted by their counts in a descending order. The results are also visualized in a bar-plot that indicates frequency counts on the y-axis and the corresponding hashtags on the x-axis. **Signs of High Risk**: The indications of a potential high-risk situation may include: - A low diversity in the usage of hashtags as indicated by a few hashtags being used disproportionately more than the others. - Repeated usage of one or few hashtags can be indicative of spam or biased dataset. - If there are no or extremely few hashtags found in the dataset, it perhaps signifies that the text data does not contain structured social media data. **Strengths**: The Hashtags test has several strong points: - It provides a concise visual representation of the frequency of hashtags, which can be critical for understanding the trend about a particular topic in text data. - It is instrumental in tasks specifically related to social media text analytics such as opinion analysis, trend discovery, etc. - The test is adaptable, allowing the flexibility to determine the number of top hashtags to be analyzed. **Limitations**: Despite its strengths, the test has some limitations: - The test assumes the presence of hashtags and therefore may not be applicable for text datasets that do not contain hashtags (e.g., formal documents, scientific literature). - Language-specific limitations of hashtag formulations are not explicitly addressed. - It does not account for typographical errors, variations or synonyms in hashtags. - This test does not provide context or sentiment associated with the hashtags.

<td id="T_9d30f_row120_col2" class="data row120 col2">**Purpose**: The "Mentions" test focuses on the aspect of data quality in an NLP (Natural Language Processing) or text-based Machine Learning model. Its main objective is to identify and analyze the frequency of 'mentions' within a given dataset, particularly within a selected text column. 'Mentions' in this context are discrete elements of text that are preceded by '@'. The output would reveal the most frequently mentioned entities or usernames, which could be crucial to certain applications like social media analyses, customer sentiment analyses, etc. **Test Mechanism**: Upon validating the presence of a text column in the provided dataset, this test applies a regular expression pattern to extract these mentions. The number of occurrences for each unique mention is then counted. The top mentions, based on user-specified parameters or by default the top 25, are selected for representation. This thresholding process forms the main mechanism of this test, showcasing high-frequency elements. The results are visually rendered in a treemap plot, wherein each rectangle's size is indicative of the corresponding mention's frequency. **Signs of High Risk**: Execution failure for this test could be linked to the absence of a valid text column in the dataset. One other indicators of high risk includes the absence of mentions in the text data, meaning that there might not be any text preceded by '@'. This conditions could indicate sparse or poor-quality data, affecting the model's ability to generalize or learn appropriately. **Strengths**: This test is specifically optimized for textual datasets, making it particularly powerful in NLP contexts. It allows rapid identification of dominant elements, displaying them visually for easy interpretation. This allows potentially pivotal insights about the most mentioned entities or usernames to be extracted. **Limitations**: This test can be limited by its dependence on '@' for the identification of mentions. Aspects of text not preceded by '@' could be potentially useful, but remain overlooked by this test. Additionally, this test is not suitable for datasets without textual data. The test doesn't present insights on less frequently occurring data or outliers, potentially leaving important patterns unrevealed.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row121_col2" class="data row121 col2">**Purpose**: This is an in-depth textual analysis test used to assess the lexical complexity, structure, and vocabulary of a given dataset. The TextDescription metric measures various parameters such as: - **Total Words**: Assess the length and complexity of the input text. Longer documents might require more sophisticated summarization techniques, while shorter ones may need more concise summaries. - **Total Sentences**: Understand the structural makeup of the content. Longer texts with numerous sentences might require the model to generate longer summaries to capture essential information. - **Avg Sentence Length**: Determine the average length of sentences in the text. This can help the model decide on the appropriate length for generated summaries, ensuring they are coherent and readable. - **Total Paragraphs**: Analyze how the content is organized into paragraphs. The model should be able to maintain the logical structure of the content when producing summaries. - **Total Unique Words**: Measure the diversity of vocabulary in the text. A higher count of unique words could indicate more complex content, which the model needs to capture accurately. - **Most Common Words**: Identify frequently occurring words that likely represent key themes. The model should pay special attention to including these words and concepts in its summaries. - **Total Punctuations**: Evaluate the usage of punctuation marks, which contribute to the tone and structure of the content. The model should be able to maintain appropriate punctuation in summaries. - **Lexical Diversity**: Calculate the richness of vocabulary in relation to the overall text length. A higher lexical diversity suggests a broader range of ideas and concepts that the model needs to capture in its summaries. It is also responsible for paring down unwanted tokens, measuring the average sentence length, and calculating the lexical diversity in the available text. This metric's measures help in understanding the nature of the text and assessing the potential challenges of machine learning algorithms deployed for textual analysis, language processing, or summarization. **Test Mechanism**: The test operates by parsing the dataset and using the NLTK library to tokenize the text into words, sentences, and paragraphs. It dissects the processed text further, removing stopwords declared in 'unwanted_tokens' and punctuations. It then calculates parameters such as the total number of words, sentences, paragraphs, punctuations; average sentence length; and lexical diversity. The metric also condenses these results and plots scatter plots for certain combinations of variables (Total Words vs Total Sentences, Total Words vs Total Unique Words, etc.) to provide a visual depiction of the text structure. **Signs of High Risk**: Anomaly in results or increased complexity in lexical diversity, long sentences and paragraphs, high uniqueness of words, or an excess of unwanted tokens can signify risk in text processing ML models. It suggests that the model's text absorption and processing capability can be compromised. Additionally, missing or erroneous visualizations may also indicate issues with the text description analysis. **Strengths**: This metric is an essential tool for ML model data pre-processing, focusing on textual analysis. It provides a detailed dissection of a text dataset to understand structural and vocabulary complexity, which is helpful to strategize a ML model's textual processing capability. Besides, it visualizes correlations between chosen variables, helping further in grasping the text's structure and complexity. **Limitations**: This metric relies heavily on the NLTK library, rendering it unsuitable for languages unsupported by NLTK. The unwanted tokens and stop words are predefined, limiting customization by context or application. This metric does not consider semantics or grammatical complexities, which can be crucial in language processing. Finally, it assumes that the document is well-structured (with sentences and paragraphs); unstructured or poorly formatted text may skew the results.</td>

<td id="T_9d30f_row122_col2" class="data row122 col2">**Purpose**: The StopWords test is a data quality assessment tool specifically designed for text data. It identifies and analyzes the usage of 'stop words' within a dataset. Stop words are frequent, common words in a language (e.g., "the", "and", "is"), which are typically considered insignificant for in-depth analysis. The test quantifies the frequency of each stop word in the dataset, further calculating their proportional usage compared to the total word count. Ultimately, it aims to highlight the prevailing stop words based on their usage frequency. **Test Mechanism**: The test triggers once it receives a 'VMDataset' object; in absence of which, it raises an error. The text column of the dataset undergoes an inspection for the creation of a 'corpus' (a collection of written texts representing the dataset). With the help of Natural Language Toolkit's (NLTK) stop word repository, the test screens the corpus for any stop words and logs their frequency. Each stop word, expressed as a percentage usage out of the total corpus, is compared against a 'min_percent_threshold'. If the percentage exceeds this threshold, the test is deemed as failed. The test returns the top prevailing stop words, decided by the 'num_words' parameter, and their percentages. It also provides a bar chart visualization of the top stop words and their usage frequency for intuitive understanding. **Signs of High Risk**: Potential signs indicating high risk are if the percentage of any stop words exceeds the predefined 'min_percent_threshold' and the application's context where a major presence of stop words could negatively impact the analytical performance due to noise generation. **Strengths**: The main strengths of the StopWords test include its ability to scrutinize and quantify the usage of stop words in a dataset, which might often be overlooked due to their insignificant semantic meaning. The test gives insights into potential noise in the text data, which could interfere with model training efficiency. Furthermore, the bar chart visualization provided by the test facilitates readily interpretable and actionable insights. **Limitations**: While robust for stop word analysis, the test does exhibit a few limitations. It only works with English stop words and therefore may not perform well on datasets in other languages. The effectiveness of the test depends on the 'min_percent_threshold', which might need to be fine-tuned for different datasets. Additionally, the test does not consider the context of the stop words used within the dataset, and hence, it might overlook their significance if used in certain contexts. Lastly, the test checks only the frequency of stop words and does not offer direct measures of model performance or predictive accuracy.</td>
