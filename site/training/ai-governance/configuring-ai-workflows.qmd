# Learning objectives {.center}

_"As an **administrator**, I want to configure workflows that support AI governance — including intake, approvals, human oversight, and escalation paths."_

::: {.tc}
<br>
This third module is part of a four-part series:

## Module 3 — Contents {.center}

::: {.f2}
1. [Intake workflows](#intake-workflows)
2. [Approval workflows](#approval-workflows)
3. [Human oversight controls](#human-oversight-controls)
4. [Escalations](#escalations)

# Intake workflows {background-color="#083E44" background-image="/training/assets/digitalspace-colours.svg"}

## What is an intake workflow? {.center}

Intake workflows control how new AI systems enter your governance program.

They ensure:

- All AI systems are registered
- Required information is captured
- Initial classification is performed
- Ownership is assigned

## Configuring intake {.center}

In {{< var vm.product >}}:

1. Define required fields for registration
2. Set up validation rules
3. Configure automatic notifications
4. Route new registrations for review

## Hands-on: Review workflow configuration {.center}

1. Navigate to **Settings > Workflows**
2. Explore the available workflow templates
3. Identify which workflows would support intake for AI systems

# Approval workflows {background-color="#083E44" background-image="/training/assets/digitalspace-colours.svg"}

## Purpose of approval workflows {.center}

Approval workflows ensure AI systems receive appropriate review before deployment.

They implement:

- Risk-based approval gates
- Multiple approver requirements
- Segregation of duties
- Documented decision-making

## Designing approval flows {.center}

Consider these design principles:

| Risk level | Approval requirements |
|------------|----------------------|
| High-risk | Multiple approvers, governance committee |
| Medium-risk | Manager + compliance review |
| Low-risk | Single approver |

## Configuring approvals {.center}

{{< var vm.product >}} supports:

- Workflow states and transitions
- Role-based approval authorities
- Sequential and parallel approvals
- Approval deadline tracking

# Human oversight controls {background-color="#083E44" background-image="/training/assets/digitalspace-colours.svg"}

## Regulatory context {.center}

The EU AI Act (Article 14) requires human oversight for high-risk AI systems.

Human oversight includes:

- Ability to understand AI outputs
- Capability to intervene
- Authority to override decisions
- Mechanisms for feedback

## Implementing oversight {.center}

Use {{< var vm.product >}} to document and enforce oversight:

- Record oversight requirements in documentation
- Configure review workflows for AI outputs
- Track intervention decisions
- Maintain evidence of human involvement

## Review workflows {.center}

Set up periodic review workflows:

1. Define review frequency by risk tier
2. Configure reviewer assignments
3. Track review completion
4. Escalate overdue reviews

# Escalations {background-color="#083E44" background-image="/training/assets/digitalspace-colours.svg"}

## Escalation paths {.center}

Configure escalations for:

- Overdue approvals
- High-risk findings
- Policy violations
- Compliance incidents

Escalation ensures issues reach appropriate decision-makers.

## Next steps {.center}

Continue to Module 4 to learn about compliance and oversight.
