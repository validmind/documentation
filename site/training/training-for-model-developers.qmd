_Learning objective: Enable model developers to submit new model use cases on the ValidMind platform and to generate & edit model documentation using the developer framework. Follows our new introduction for model developers notebook._

## Prerequisites

To try out this training module, you need to have been [onboarded onto the ValidMind training environment](training-overview.html#onboarding).

# Session 1:<br>Developer Framework

## 1. Initialize the Developer Framework

Install the client library, register a new model to document in the model inventory, and preview the documentation template.

## 2. Start the model development process

Initialize datasets, access ValidMind’s repository of tests, run pre-built tests, investigate the results, and add evidence to documentation.

## 3. Edit model documentation

Understand how to use text and test-driven content blocks in the Platform UI to expand the existing template structure of your model documentation, and edit documentation.

## 4. Finalize testing and documentation

Ensure model documentation includes custom tests and apply configuration changes. Finalize the process with a fully documented model ready for review.

# ValidMind Platform UI<br>Session 2

## 1. Implement custom tests and integrate external test providers

Include your own custom tests and include them in model documentation as additional evidence, and register an external test provider to run your own tests.

## 2. Collaborate with others

Explore methods for collaborating with model validators on documentation projects.

## 3. View documentation activity

Track changes and updates made to model documentation over time.

## 4. Submit for approval

Follow the process for submitting documentation for review and approval to ensure compliance.

## 5. PREVIEW: Use the AI-based documentation assistant

Use the ValidMind AI tool to auto-generate a starting point for sections of the model documentation and to gain insight into test results.
