**Depending on the configuration of your workflows, you may or may not be able to move a model into another workflow state as actions can be gated to only users of certain roles.**

When all the actions that can be performed by your role are completed for that model at that stage of the workflow, actions will disappear from your view.

### Verify workflows

Workflows are configured by an administrator in advance. When transitioning a workflow, verify that the workflow steps reflect your organization's requirements for that part of the model lifecycle.
