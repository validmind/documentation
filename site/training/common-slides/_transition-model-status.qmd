When youâ€™re ready, verify the approval workflow, and then submit your model documentation for approval:

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Verify workflow

Workflow states and transitions are configured by an administrator in advance, but you should verify that the expected people are included in the approval process.

{{< include /guide/model-workflows/_model-workflows-see.qmd >}}

### Submit for approval

To transition through the approval workflow, all required workflow steps must be completed. By default, a model must be in the <br>[In Documentation]{.bubble} state before you can submit it for validation.

{{< include /guide/model-workflows/_model-workflows-transition.qmd >}}
