When you're ready, verify the active workflow, and then progress your model using workflows:

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Verify workflow

Workflows are configured by an administrator in advance. When transitioning a workflow, verify that the workflow steps reflect your organization's requirements for that part of the model lifecycle.

{{< include /guide/model-workflows/_review-active-workflows.qmd >}}

### Submit for approval

To transition through the approval workflow, all required workflow steps must be completed. By default, a model must be in the <br>[In Documentation]{.bubble} state before you can submit it for validation.

{{< include /guide/model-workflows/_transition-model-workflows.qmd >}}
