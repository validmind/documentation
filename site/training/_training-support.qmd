Have feedback or questions?^[To get help from a human, [**open a support ticket**](/support/support.qmd#open-a-support-ticket).] 

   - We sponsor an interactive Slack community where you can **provide feedback** or **ask questions** — [Join Our Community Slack](/about/contributing/join-community.qmd){target="_blank"}.
   - There is a **dedicated channel for support** — [#community-support](https://validmind.slack.com/archives/C05FUFY9C4S). 

Our growing Slack community is not just for our products but also aims to foster discussions between AI risk practitioners and those involved in model risk management (MRM). Feel free to take a look around the other channels that are available and stay a while.
