# Objectives

- **Explain the approach** — We want to streamline user journeys, starting with our getting started experience. Let's talk about how we're going to accomplish that.
- **Gather team input** — The new documentation site should be a *team* effort; we want your ideas on updated content and design*!

:::: {.tc .mt5 .f2 .bg-light-pink .br4 .pa2 .ba-l}
***DESIGN DISCLAIMER**

::: {.f4}
Any new site mockups shown in this demo are **ideas** — they are simply wireframes and not reflective of the final designs.

## In this demo

1. [Current documentation experience](#current-documentation-experience)
2. [Improved documentation experience](#improved-documentation-experience)
3. [What's next](#whats-next)


# Current documentation experience {background-color="#083E44" background-image="../assets/home-hero.svg"}

Presents **too many choices** without a clear call to action for non-developers.

## {background-iframe="https://docs.validmind.ai/" background-interactive="true" data-preload="yes"}

:::: {.absolute bottom=15 left=0 right=50 .w-100 .f3 .pl4 .pr4 .overlay}
::: {.tc}
**Current homepage ...**
:::

::: {.f4}
The "Get Started" section is buried under a layer of navigation, making harder for new users to find what they need.

- The three main card tiles lack clear, compelling next actions.
- They also link to instructional guides — way too granular for new users.
- Prime real estate is used for secondary content, like blog and event links, instead of actionable next steps for users.

**Current getting started ...**
:::

- We have a QuickStart, **but it works only for developers.**
- Everyone else gets deep links into the documentation
<br> without a structured learning journey.

::: {.f4 .pl3 .pr3 .embed}
But even for developers, **the segmentation of content is not entirely clear.**

**Current developer portal ...**

Mish-mash of random user guides and conceptual overload.

:::: {.fr .f3 .mv5 .nr4 .pa5 .overlay}

**Current content & navigation ...**
:::

- The “About” section is overloaded with<br> different content types that could be separated.
- Meanwhile, sections like “Support” and “FAQ”<br> could be combined to simplify navigation.

# Improved documentation experience {background-color="#083E44" background-image="../assets/home-hero.svg"}

::: {.column width="65%" .bl .pl4 .f3}
- **Prioritize a** **clear CTA** for onboarding—make "Getting Started" prominent and accessible to all users.
- **Improve content segmentation** so that users can easily navigate based on their role and experience level.
- **Streamline the** **navigation structure**, reducing unnecessary layers and surfacing key information faster.
- **Optimize homepage real estate** to focus on user action rather than secondary content.

**Refined home page**
:::

::: {.f4}
- Our future homepage reimagines user onboarding by making "Getting Started" an immediate, accessible experience for all user roles, worded in a way that is also **welcoming to aspiring MRM professionals.**
- Instead of forcing users to dig through layers of navigation, the homepage itself now serves as the **entry point for their journey.**
- Beyond just guiding users into the platform, the new home page will also explain our value proposition to a broader audience. Our "About" section will be reworked to **expand on our product value proposition and product tour.**

Focused, role-based onboarding delivering clarity and direction for every user

::: {.f3}
<br>Instead of a generic starting point, each persona — developers, validators, and admins — gets a tailored experience that aligns with their specific needs.
:::
:::

::: {.column width="60%" .bl .pl4 .f3}
- **A clear value proposition**—what ValidMind helps them achieve.
- **A simple "getting started" path**—highlighting key actions upfront.
- **A single, focused call to action**—eliminating confusion on what to do next.

::: {.embed .pl3 .f4}
This approach means that developers can **dive straight into the library** with a code snippet and sample workflows. Validators see **compliance-focused tools that link to regulatory needs**. And admins find **clear onboarding steps** to manage users and workflows.

**One role, one path — multiple personas**
:::

::: {.f4}
- By structuring onboarding around distinct personas, we eliminate guesswork and ensure that each user can engage with ValidMind, makes the platform more approachable for everyone.
- Whether they are an admin setting up the system or a validator reviewing models, they are met with a targeted QuickStart experience that helps them achieve their goals efficiently and confidently.

**Improved support experience**
:::

As part of flattening our navigation, we can also improve the support experience by combining our main “Support” landing page with our “FAQ” section.

**More improvements to come ...**

Redefining the getting started or onboarding journey<br> is just the first piece of the puzzle.

Subsequent initiatives will include:

- Revamped user guide section —
<br>less clutter, more discoverability
- Updated, more comprehensive training

### New content, new look

With our clear goal in mind, we'll work together with the design team to implement a skin that matches the snappiness of the improved content.
