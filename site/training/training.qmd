Gain hands-on experience and explore what ValidMind has to offer with our training environment. 

The training environment mimics a production environment and includes comprehensive resources such as notebooks with sample code you can run, sample models registered in the model inventory, and draft documentation and validation reports.

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-50-ns}

Most of our model documentation features are available for you to test in the training environment, including automated model testing & documentation, preparing model validation reports, and large language model (LLM) support. 

These features provide a rich context for testing and evaluation, using models and datasets provided by ValidMind and hosted in our own environment.

## {{< fa graduation-cap >}} Onboarding

Step-by-step instructions: 

1. Get your access credentials from ValidMind. 

   If you haven't reached out to us yet, email <info@validmind.ai> to enquire about access to the training environment.

<!--- FUTURE step for self-signup
1. Get your access credentials for the {{< var vm.platform >}} by signing up with ValidMind: [{{< var url.us1 >}}]({{< var url.us1 >}})
   
   This is the login URL for our {{< var vm.platform >}} where you can look at the model inventory for the different models. 
--->

2. When you receive your access credentials, make sure you can log in:

   - **ValidMind Jupyter Hub** — <https://jupyterhub.validmind.ai/>
   - **{{< var validmind.platform >}}** — [{{< var url.us1 >}}]({{< var url.us1 >}})

3. Join a kick-off session with ValidMind to get a free instructor-led hands-on demo.

   After we have received your request to try out the training environment, we will contact you to set up a kick-off session.

4. Try the training environment — [Getting started](#getting-started)
