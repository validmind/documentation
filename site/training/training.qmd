## Learn by doing

Our training environment mimics a production environment and includes comprehensive resources such as notebooks with sample code you can run, sample models registered in the model inventory, and draft documentation and validation reports.

Most of our model documentation features are available for you to test in the training environment, including automated model testing & documentation, preparing model validation reports, and large language model (LLM) support. 

These features provide a rich context for testing and evaluation, using models and datasets provided by ValidMind and hosted in our own environment. 

### Sample models

Sample models registered in the model inventory include:

- Housing prices prediction model
- Credit risk scorecard model
- Customer churn prediction model
- Interest rate time series forecasting model
- Large language model (LLM) demo application

Please note that we make updates to the models and datasets available in the training environment from time to time to provide you with our latest features. 

### Sample notebooks 

Each interactive notebook includes the sample code needed to test and document a model:
