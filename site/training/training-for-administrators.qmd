_Onboard your organization, manage users and roles, and manage permissions for specific roles._

## Prerequisites {.center}

To try out this training module, you need to have been [onboarded](training-overview.html#onboarding) as the first user onto the ValidMind training environment.

Log into the ValidMind Platform UI to check your access:

<br><form method="get" action="https://app.prod.validmind.ai/" target="_blank" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
   <button type="submit" style="color: white; background-color: #de257e; border-radius: 8px; border: none; font-size: 32px; padding: 6.25px 12.5px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Log in<br></button>

## 1. Onboard your organization

Invite initial users by entering their email addresses and sending out invitations. Create groups to organize users based on departments or project teams. Assign roles and permissions to users, defining their access levels and responsibilities.

## 2. Manage users and roles

Add new users by entering their details and assigning them to appropriate groups. Edit user profiles to update information or change their roles and permissions. Remove users who no longer need access to the platform, ensuring security.

## 3. Manage permissions

Ensure compliance with organizational policies by reviewing and updating user permissions. Set role-specific permissions to control what each user can access and modify within the platform.

## 4. Manage templates

Customize documentation templates to create consistent and comprehensive model documentation and validation reports. These templates are standardized to ensure uniformity but can be tailored to meet your specific project needs.

## 5. Manage workflows

Ensure compliance by verifying your current approval workflow, advance documentation through tailored workflow states, and customize workflows with multiple review stages for your organizational needs.
