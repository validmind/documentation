title: "Understanding our curriculum"
---

 To structure the training curriculum effectively, here are some key questions to clarify needs:

### 1.	Learning Objectives

- What specific knowledge or skills should each audience group gain from the training?
- Are there compliance or regulatory aspects that must be covered, particularly for model developers and validators?

### 2.	Delivery Format

- Will this be self-paced online training, instructor-led sessions, or a mix?
- Do we need interactive elements like quizzes, hands-on exercises, or case studies?

### 3.	Course Structure

- Should training be structured in modules based on user roles, product features, or workflows?
- Do we need a general introduction to ValidMind before role-specific training?

### 4.	Assessment & Certification

- Will there be assessments to validate understanding?
- Do customers expect a certification for completing the training?

### 5.	Integration with Existing Documentation

- How much of the training content should be derived from the existing docs, and what gaps need to be filled?
- Should training directly reference docs, or should it be more self-contained?
