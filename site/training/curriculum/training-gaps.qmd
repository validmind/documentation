This page compares known customer questions against the courses to identify content gaps.

## Administrator Fundamentals

### Module 1
✅ Set up an organization – Related to creating users, roles, and mapping users to groups.  
✅ Onboard users – Covers adding users and assigning roles, but may lack workflow integration details.  
✅ Manage roles, permissions, and groups – Directly relevant to customer questions on roles and group management.  

### Module 2
✅ Manage templates – Covers template management but may not include details on editing/swapping templates for validation.  
✅ Manage workflows – Covers modifying workflows and MRM setup, though depth is unknown.  

### Gaps:  
- ❌ How to configure model inventory, e.g. add model inventory fields? (Moduleially related to configuring model inventory, but not explicitly covered.)

## Developer Fundamentals  

### Module 1
✅ Initialize the ValidMind developer environment – No direct match with customer questions, but foundational for developers.  
✅ Start the model development process – Likely covers registering models with templates but not explicitly stated.  
✅ Edit model documentation – Relevant to documentation-related questions.  
✅ Collaborate with others  

### Module 2
✅ Train a model  
✅ Implement custom tests and integrate external test providers – Covers adding tests, though comparison tests are not explicitly mentioned.  
✅ Finalize testing and documentation  

### Module 3
✅ View documentation activity  
✅ Submit for approval  

### Gaps:  
- ❌ How to register a model with an existing template? (In notebook, but not called out separately)
- ❌ How to prepare data sets?
- ❌ How to reuse existing tests to create new comparison tests?  

## Validator Fundamentals  

### Module 1
✅ Review model documentation  
✅ Analyze test results  
✅ Add findings, assess compliance, and link evidence  
✅ Prepare validation reports  

### Module 2
✅ Track issue resolution  
✅ Submit for review and approval  

### Gaps:  
- ❌ How to overview for validation reports?  
- ❌ How do I use validation report templates?

## Monitoring Fundamentals (New Course)  

✅ How does monitoring integrate with the documentation process?  
✅ How to schedule quarterly or monthly monitoring runs?

# Summary of Remaining Content Gaps  

| Category                     | Missing Topics in Fundamentals |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Configuration & Setup         | How to add model inventory fields? |
| Templates, Documentation & Testing | How to register a model with an existing template? <br> How to prepare data sets? <br> How to reuse existing tests to create new comparison tests? |
| Validation                    | How to use the validation report? <br> How do I use validation report templates? |

# Next Steps  

- Expand Developer & Validator Fundamentals:  
  - Add structured training on model registration with templates.  
  - Include a section on preparing data sets in Developer Fundamentals.  
  - Provide more clarity on using the validation report and validation report templates in Validator Fundamentals.  

Would you like to discuss how to integrate these missing topics into the existing course structure, or should we consider creating additional training modules for them?
