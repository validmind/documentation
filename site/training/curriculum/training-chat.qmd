That makes sense. To structure the training curriculum effectively, here are some key questions to clarify needs:
1.	Learning Objectives
•	What specific knowledge or skills should each audience group gain from the training?
•	Are there compliance or regulatory aspects that must be covered, particularly for model developers and validators?
2.	Delivery Format
•	Will this be self-paced online training, instructor-led sessions, or a mix?
•	Do we need interactive elements like quizzes, hands-on exercises, or case studies?
3.	Course Structure
•	Should training be structured in modules based on user roles, product features, or workflows?
•	Do we need a general introduction to ValidMind before role-specific training?
4.	Assessment & Certification
•	Will there be assessments to validate understanding?
•	Do customers expect a certification for completing the training?
5.	Integration with Existing Documentation
•	How much of the training content should be derived from the existing docs, and what gaps need to be filled?
•	Should training directly reference docs, or should it be more self-contained?

Would you like to start by mapping out a high-level course structure, or should we dive into specific role-based training needs first?

I'll help extract and concatenate the sections discussing training, removing timestamps and speaker attributions for better readability. Let me analyze the transcript and pull out those relevant sections.



Here are the concatenated sections discussing training:

Mehdi mentions they're getting some movement on training this week and that yesterday's session was helpful to start identifying what they need for technical training.

The discussion covers several key training topics and needs:

1. Training Topics and Organization:
- Need to map out training topics and group them into scenarios representing what different users will need to do
- Consider sequencing and who needs to learn what
- Topics include:
  - How to configure model inventory and add inventory fields
  - How to configure workflows for MRM
  - How to create new roles and add users to roles
  - How to create/edit/swap templates
  - How to register a model with existing template
  - How to generate documentation for models and submit for validation
  - How to work with prompting and Gen AI content generation
  - How to create custom tests and reuse existing tests
  - How to add metadata to datasets
  - How to use Validation Report
  - How to set up monitoring pipeline as an engineer

2. Current Challenges:
- Need to move from collection of questions and individual documentation pages to creating a proper training curriculum
- Need curriculum that supports onboarding of new organizations
- Focus on technical users, starting with model developers
- Current training has everything in one course for developers and one for validators
- Need to break content into more digestible chunks

3. Proposed Approach:
- Create smaller, targeted training modules for specific parts of the product
- Also have modules that give full proficiency training for different roles
- Use scenario-based and end-to-end training
- Break up courses into multiple smaller modules instead of one giant module
- Include videos with playlists segmented according to training modules
- Focus first on curriculum mapping and sequencing before dealing with registration systems

4. Timeline and Priority:
- Need curriculum way before April (which is limited availability release)
- For alpha release, focus on training technical consultants like those on yesterday's call
- Don't need everything recorded immediately but need the curriculum plan
- Can deliver live training between team members once curriculum is established
- Training plan is one of core priorities for sprint 68

5. Next Steps:
- Nick will create first draft of curriculum/training plan for review next week
- Initial focus on developers and admins since Experience users will play both roles
- Will need Michael's input on customer perspective
- Need to identify content gaps and create new material where needed
- Plan to map out what the training journey looks like
