# Objective

_"As a member of the ValidMind product, engineering, or design teams, who is responsible for shaping, creating, or implementing features, I want to do my part in ensuring that documentation and other collateral can be completed as part of feature deployment."_

What is *storytelling*?

::: {.f3}
- Storytelling is the idea that the narrative around the feature involves more than user guides.
- Storytelling has at least two (2) parts: the scoping, and the implementation.

### Scoping

Scoping is **mandatory** — even if the outcome of scoping is nothing needs to be implemented, that's important info we wouldn't have had without scoping:

- Scoping involves discussion around the feature, ideally during initial shaping, no later than post-implementation review.
- During scoping, we define what collateral is required: user guides, terminology or UI updates, feature highlight posts, videos, etc.
- For scoping to be considered complete when collateral is identified and the acceptance criteria outlined, context about the feature must be provided: the feature owners are responsible for showcasing the functionality, explaining the use case or supplying examples, etc.

### Implementation

Implementation depends on what is identified during scoping:

- Individual follow-up tasks are identified during scoping, and are considered **blocked** until acceptance criteria and feature context are provided.
- The feature should not be considered "complete" until implementation of storytelling is also done.

POP QUIZ

:::

::: {.column width="75%" .bl .pl4 .f3}
- Who knows about the `needs-docs` automation? (What does it do?)
- Who has used the automation before?
- ... and followed-up by providing context about the feature?
- Who has provided context about the feature proactively?
- Who has triggered the automation *before* the feature was pushed into production?
- Who believes that storytelling is part of the definition of "done?"
- ... and that good storytelling helps us empower our external and internal users?

Aim for participation, not perfection

:::

::: {.column width="70%" .bl .pl4 .f3}
Storytelling is a **shared** responsibility. So together let's commit to:

- [x] Changing our perception of what "documentation" includes — not just user guides
- [x] Asking questions around what storytelling is required, early on — "left-shifting" the process
- [x] Proactively ensuring that enough context is provided for collateral to be created — ownership of information transfer

### Storytelling Story Template

To assist in scoping storytelling, there is now a template in Shortcut for product managers and anyone else involved in the shaping process:

- Scoping is important work that should be tracked — if we decide no documentation is required, we also have built-in paper trail.
- Storytelling scoping stories should belong to the same epic and sprint as the feature it is related to.
- This template asks all the questions required for the implementation of collateral to be considered ready to be worked on.
- This template will replace the old `needs-docs` Zapier automation — because storytelling is a discussion and not a toggle.

### `needs-docs` label

The old `needs-docs` Zapier automation will be **turned off** after next Monday's company-wide meeting (April 21st, 2025):

- This means that a "Documentation — {{feature}}" Story will no longer be automatically created when you add this label to a Story.
- Instead, stories for tasks identified during storytelling scoping will be created manually once all the information is available — hopefully encouraging interaction instead of "set it and forget it." These stories will be linked to the storytelling scoping story.
- We'll keep the label for flagging *documentation tech debt*<sup>1</sup> — any features that slip through the new storytelling process that need follow-up after the fact.

::: {.f4 .pl3 .pr3 .embed}
<sup>**1**</sup> **Who can use this label to identify tech debt?**

Everyone! If you see a **completed** feature that doesn't have any associated documentation stories, feel free to add the label to the feature Story — this helps the Community team and Product Managers isolate and review the backlog.
