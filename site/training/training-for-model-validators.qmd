## _Learning objective: Enable model validators to review and approve documentation and on the ValidMind platform._ {.center}

## Prerequisites {.center}

To try out this training module, you need to have been [onboarded onto the ValidMind training environment](training-overview.html#onboarding).

## 1. Review documentation

Verify that all documentation is complete and compliant with regulatory standards by cross-checking with provided guidelines. Collaborate with model developers.

## 2. Analyze test results

Access the test results section in ValidMind, review the data, and interpret the findings to identify any issues with model performance. Link evidence and findings to validation reports.

##  3. Prepare validation reports

Use predefined templates within the ValidMind platform to create validation reports. Ensure all necessary data from model tests and evaluations are included.

## 4. Track approvals

Submit validation reports for review through the ValidMind platform, monitor the approval status, and address any feedback or required changes.

## PREVIEW: AI documentation assistant

Use the ValidMind AI tool to auto-generate initial report content based on model metadata and to gain insight into test results.
