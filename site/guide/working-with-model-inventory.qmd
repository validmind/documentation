The model inventory holds all models. Within the model inventory, register, organize, and configure models.

## Prerequisites
You should have models registered in the model inventory. See our guide on how to register models below.

## Search, filter, and sort models
First, navigate to the [model inventory](https://app.prod.validmind.ai/model-inventory).

#### Search models
Search for models using **{{< fa magnifying-glass >}} Search**. 

#### Filter models
Use **{{< fa filter >}} Filter** to filter models by business units, developers, model tiering, model status, owners, use, validators, or vendor model.

#### Sort models
Use **{{< fa arrow-up-wide-short >}} Sort** to sort results by certain criteria.


## Customize model inventory layout
Customize the layout of the model inventory by switching between card and table view. Also, configure columns in table view.

Make sure you're in the [model inventory](https://app.prod.validmind.ai/model-inventory).

### Manage columns
Click **{{< fa table >}} Manage Columns** to manage column visibility and order. You can toggle visibility for each category and drag the option to change the order.
