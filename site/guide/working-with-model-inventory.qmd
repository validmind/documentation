The model inventory stores all models. Within the model inventory, register, organize, and configure models to suit your needs.

## Prerequisites
You should have models [registered in the model inventory](register-models-in-model-inventory.qmd). 

## Search, filter, and sort models
1. [Log in to the {{< var vm_platform >}}]({{< var vm_url >}}).

2. Click **Model Inventory** in the left sidebar. 

3. Use the top buttons to organize the model inventory to your preference:
   - Search for models using **{{< fa magnifying-glass >}} Search**. 
   - Use **{{< fa filter >}} Filter** to filter models by business units, developers, model tiering, model status, owners, use, validators, or vendor model.
   - Use **{{< fa arrow-up-wide-short >}} Sort** to sort results by certain criteria.
