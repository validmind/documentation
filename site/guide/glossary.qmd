ValidMind developer framework <span id="developer-framework">
: ValidMind's set of tools, guidelines, and standards designed to provide developers with a structured approach to documenting risk models. Includes our Python library, API endpoints, and other software components that simplify the model development process. Also see [ValidMind platform](#validmind-platform).

ValidMind platform {#validmind-platform}
: ValidMind's hosted multi-tenant architecture that includes the cloud-based web interface, APIs, databases, documentation and validation engine, and various internal services. Also see [developer framework](#developer-framework).

first line of defense
: Responsible for developing risk models. Includes the model owners, developers, and users who ensure that the models are developed and documented appropriately and that associated risks are identified, assessed, and managed effectively. The first line of defense is accountable for implementing effective model risk management practices at the business unit level and plays a critical role in identifying and mitigating potential risks associated with models.

model developer
: Responsible for developing, implementing, and maintaining risk models. Model developers are typically subject matter experts in their domain and are responsible for ensuring that the model is fit-for-purpose, accurate, and aligned with the business requirements.

The model developer is responsible for designing, building, and refining models to ensure their accuracy, reliability, and compliance with regulatory requirements in the context of model risk management. This involves selecting appropriate algorithms, managing data quality, addressing biases, and testing model performance across various scenarios. The developer also plays a crucial role in communicating model assumptions, limitations, and validation results to stakeholders, while continuously seeking opportunities for improvement and staying abreast of evolving industry standards and best practices.


model risk management (MRM)
: The process of identifying, assessing, and controlling risks associated with models used in financial institutions. Governance and risk management functions oversee the MRM process and ensure compliance with policies. 

model risk
: The potential for financial loss, incorrect decisions or unintended consequences resulting from errors or inaccuracies in financial models.

model governance
: The policies, procedures, and controls put in place by financial institutions to manage and monitor the use of models.

monitoring
: The process of identifying model performance issues, detecting model drift, and ensuring the continued accuracy and relevance of the model.

second line of defense
: Responsible for validating and challenging the risk models developed and used by the first line of defense. Ensures compliance with applicable regulations and guidelines, and  monitors the effectiveness of the first line's model risk management (MRM) practices and provides guidance  to enhance the first line's understanding of model risk management.

validation, model validation 
: The process of evaluating and testing models to ensure that they are accurate, reliable, and effective with the help of our  platform.
