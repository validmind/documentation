developer framework <span id="developer-framework">
: ValidMind's set of tools, guidelines, and standards designed to provide developers with a structured approach to documenting risk models. Includes our Python library, API endpoints, and other software components that simplify the model development process. Also see [Saas Platform](#saas-platform).

first line of defense
: Responsible for developing risk models. Includes the model owners, developers, and users who ensure that the models are developed and documented appropriately and that associated risks are identified, assessed, and managed effectively. The first line of defense is accountable for implementing effective model risk management practices at the business unit level and plays a critical role in identifying and mitigating potential risks associated with models.

Ensures compliance with applicable regulations and guidelines, and  monitors the effectiveness of the first line's model risk management (MRM) practices and provides guidance  to enhance the first line's understanding of model risk management.

validation, model validation 
: The process of evaluating and testing models to ensure that they are accurate, reliable, and effective with the help of our  platform.
