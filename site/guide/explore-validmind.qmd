## Try the Developer Framework 

To see how the ValidMind Developer Framework works, try our introductory Jupyter notebook. 

This notebook shows you how to initialize the ValidMind Developer Framework and run functions from a sample dataset for a customer churn model that we trained for this demo.

### Steps

1. Open the Quickstart notebook: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NLtjCFUZV2I_ttGUkiAL9uwGZK_SGUlw?usp=share_link)
  
   Google Colaboratory (Colab) is a free Jupyter notebook environment that runs in the cloud. You can work with, run, and download our sample Jupyter notebooks from there.

2. Make a copy of the Quikstart notebook for yourself: 
  
   a. In Colab, click **File** > **Save a copy in Drive** > make your own copy in Google Drive so that you can modify the notebook. 
   
   Alternatively, you can download the notebook source and work with it in your own developer environment.

4. From the **Runtime** drop-down menu at the top, select **Run all**.

   The notebook will install the ValidMind library and then connect to the ValidMind Platform.

### Getting errors in Google Colaboratory?
Try this: From the **Runtime** drop-down menu, select **Restart and run all**.

You should see a message like this near the bottom of the **Initialize ValidMind** section:

```bash
Connected to ValidMind. Project: Customer Churn Model - Initial Validation (xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)
```

## Explore the ValidMind Platform

Next, let's take a look at how the Developer Framework works hand-in-hand with the ValidMind Platform and how documentation and test results get uploaded. 

The ValidMind Platform is the central place to: 

  - View results and documentation uploaded via the Developer Framework
  - Collaborate with other model developers, model reviewers and validators, and other users involved in the documentation and validation workflow

[![](dashboard.png){width=80% fig-align="center" fig-alt="An image showing the ValidMind UI main dashboard"}]({{< var vm_ui >}})

## Steps

1. [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_ui >}}).

2. From the side navigation, select **Model Inventory**.

3. Locate or search for the `[Quickstart] Customer Churn Model - Initial Validation` and select it.

   On the model details page that open, you can find important information about the model, such as:

    - The ID of the model and its specific use case
    - The owners, developers, validators, and business unit associated with the model
    - The risk tier and current version
    - And more

4. Scroll down to **Project History** and select the model.

   On the project overview page that opens, you can see what is included, such as model, project findings, recent activity, and project stakeholders, and more. In the left sidebar menu you can find links to the documentation, project findings, validation report, audit trail, and client integration.

   For this Quickstart, we will focus on the **Documentation** section to show you how content from the Developer Framework gets uploaded into it. 

   Note that the model status is **In Documentation**. This is the status that a model starts in as part of a documentation project. 
   
   You can click **See workflow** to look at what the full workflow is, from documentation, to validation, to review, and finally approval. 

5. From the left sidebar menu select **Documentation** > **2. Data preparation** > **2.1. Data description**. 

   ![](data-description.png){width=95% fig-align="left" fig-alt="An image showing the data description page in the ValidMind UI"}

   This content is _generated_ by the ValidMind Developer Framework and provides information about the dataset used, including histograms, information about dataset quality, and test results.

   Sections that need your attention get flagged with `Requires Attention`. These sections get flagged _automatically_ by the Developer Framework whenever a test result is above or below a certain threshold.

6. From the left sidebar select **3. Model Development** and any of the subsection to see information that has been uploaded by the Developer Framework about:

   - Model training
   - Model evaluation
   - Model explainability and interpretability
   - Model diagnosis

   The **Documentation Guidelines** in the **ValidMind Insights** right sidebar can tell you more about what these sections mean and help you with the task of documenting the model.

7. Finally, take a look at section **4. Monitoring and Governance**. 

   Sections like **4.1 Monitoring Plan** are not generated by the Developer Framework, but they get added by the model developer in the Platform UI.

## Create a new documentation project

Next, let's learn how to create your own documentation project. You can use this project to upload tests and documentation and then add that to your own copy of the Quickstart notebook you looked at earlier.

### Steps 

1. Navigate to the landing page by clicking on the ValidMind logo or if you have to, [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_ui >}}).
   
2. From the left sidebar select Documentation Projects and on the **Documentation Projects** page, click the **Create new Project** button at top right of the screen.
   
3. Select the right options in the form:

   - **Model**: `[Quickstart] Customer Churn Model`
   - **Type**: `Initial validation` (selected automatically)
<!---   - **Model Use Case**: `Attrition/Churn Management` (under `Marketing/Sales`). --->
   - **Project name**: Enter your preferred name

4. Click **Create Project**.

   ValidMind will create an empty documentation project associated with the customer churn model. 
   
   You can now access this project from the UI on the **Documentation Projects** page or by navigating to the relevant model - `[Quickstart] Customer Churn Model` - in the **Model Inventory** page.

5. From the left sidebar select **Client Integration**. This will take you to the the newly created documentation project's settings for ValidMind's developer framework, locate the project identifier, API key, and secret:
   
   - `api_host`: The location of the ValidMind API
   - `api_key`: The account API key
   - `api_secret`: The account secret key
   - `project`: The project identifier

   The code snippet can be copied and pasted directly into your developer source code to integrate the ValidMind Developer Framework and to be able to upload to the ValidMind Platform. 
   
   To follow best practices, you can also store the credentials in a `.env` file and pass them in via environment variables.

### Missing the API_SECRET?
Try this: Use the  {{< fa copy >}} **icon** to copy the `API_SECRET` to your clipboard.

## Modify the Quickstart notebook to upload to your own project

After you have completed these steps, you are ready to use your documentation project with your copy of the Quickstart notebook. 

### Steps

1. Reopen your copy of the Quickstart notebook in Google Colaboratory.

2. In the Quickstart notebook, replace the `vm.init()` lines that look like the following with your own client integration information from the earlier step when you created your new project:

   [![](google-colab-secrets.png){width=95% fig-align="left" fig-alt="The Quickstart notebook in Colab with the section showing that you need to replace"}]({{< var vm_ui >}})

3. From the **Runtime** drop-down menu at the top, select **Run all**.
   
   The notebook will install the ValidMind library and then connect to your own documentation project in the ValidMind Platform.

You can now switch back to the Platform UI and view the documentation that has been uploaded by the Developer Framework.
