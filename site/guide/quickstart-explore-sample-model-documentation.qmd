First, let's take a look at how the ValidMind handles model documentation. The best place to start is with the ValidMind Platform UI.

The ValidMind Platform UI is the central place to: 

- Work with model documentation and test results uploaded with the ValidMind Developer Framework.
- Prepare validation reports, work with model findings, and link evidence to findings.
- Collaborate with others, including model developers, model validators, and reviewers.

## Steps

1. [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_ui >}}).

2. Click **Model Inventory**.

3. Locate or search for the `[QuickStart] Customer Churn Model - Initial Validation` and select it.

   On the model details page that open, you can find important information about the model, such as:

    - The use case
    - The owners, validators, developers, and business unit associated with the model
    - The risk tier, model status, and current version
    - Model findings, recent activity, and much more

   In the left sidebar, you can find helpful links to the model documentation, model findings, validation report, audit trail, and getting started information for integrating with the developer framework.

   Note that the model status is **In Documentation**. This is the status that a model starts in as part of the default workflow. You can click **{{< fa arrow-right-arrow-left >}} See workflow** to visualize the entire workflow that this model will go through.

5. In the left sidebar, select **Documentation** > **2. Data preparation** > **2.1. Data description**.

   This content is _generated_ by the ValidMind Developer Framework and provides information about the dataset used, including histograms, information about dataset quality, and test results.

   Sections that need your attention get flagged with `Requires Attention`. These sections get flagged _automatically_ by the developer framework whenever a test result is above or below a certain threshold.

6. In the left sidebar, select **3. Model Development** and any of the subsection to see information that has been uploaded by the developer framework about:

   - Model training
   - Model evaluation
   - Model explainability and interpretability
   - Model diagnosis

   The **Documentation Guidelines** in the **ValidMind Insights** right sidebar can tell you more about what these sections mean and help you with the task of documenting the model.

7. Finally, take a look at section **4. Monitoring and Governance**. 

   Sections like **4.1 Monitoring Plan** are not generated by the developer framework, but they get added by the model developer in the Platform UI.
