To provide an unbiased starting point that enables more efficient discussions between validators and developers, you assess compliance with guidelines based on analyzing evidence and findings.

## Prerequisites

- You hold the `Validator` role 
- The model you are documenting is registered in the model inventory
- A model developer has marked their model documentation as **Ready for Validation**

## Link evidence to reports

1. [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_url >}}).

2. In the left sidebar, click [**Model Inventory**](https://app.prod.validmind.ai/model-inventory).

3. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.

4. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Validation Report** and then **2. Validation**.

   You can now jump to any subsection of the validation report by expanding the table of contents on the left and selecting the relevant section you would like to work with.

   For example: Select **2.1.1. Assumptions**.

5. In any section of the documentation where the button is available, hover over text content and click **{{< fa plus >}} Link evidence to report**.

6. On the **Link evidence to validation report** page that opens:

   - From the **Tests** or **Metrics** tab, select the evidence that is related to your assessment. 
   - If you are not sure if something is relevant, you can toggle the section to expand it for more details. 

7. Click **Update linked evidence**.

The newly linked-to evidence now gets shown under **Developer Evidence**.

## Link findings to reports

1. [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_url >}}).

2. In the left sidebar, click [**Model Inventory**](https://app.prod.validmind.ai/model-inventory).

3. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.

4. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Validation Report** and then **2. Validation**.

   You can now jump to any subsection of the validation report by expanding the table of contents on the left and selecting the relevant section you would like to work with.

   For example: Select **2.1.1. Assumptions**.

5. In any section of the documentation where the button is available, hover over text content and click **{{< fa plus >}} Link finding to report**. 

   ![](link-finding.png){width=60% fig-alt="A screenshot of the validation report section 2.1.1. that shows a compliance assessment with the option to link to finding."}

6. On the **Link finding to report** page that opens, select from the list of available findings, or [create a new finding](work-with-model-findings.qmd#add-project-findings). 

7. Click **Update linked findings**.

The newly linked-to finding now gets shown under **Findings**.

## Provide your compliance assessments

1. [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_url >}}).

2. In the left sidebar, click [**Model Inventory**](https://app.prod.validmind.ai/model-inventory).

3. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.

4. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Validation Report** and then **2. Validation**.

   You can now jump to any subsection of the validation report by expanding the table of contents on the left and selecting the relevant section you would like to work with.

   For example: Select **2.1.1. Assumptions**.

5. In any section of the documentation where the **Assessment** dropdown menu is available, select one of the available options:

   - No compliance — No tests have been run and no other evidence has been provided
   - Some compliance — Evidence provided but not properly documented or verifiable
   - Strong compliance — Evidence provided and documented, but not validated
   - Full compliance — Evidence provided, documented, and validated

   For example: To indicate that there is some compliance based on the evidence or findings you linked to:

   ![](assess-compliance.png){width=60% fig-alt="A screenshot of the validation report section 2.1.1. that shows a compliance assessment with the option to link to finding."}

6. On the **Link finding to report** page that opens, select from the list of available findings, or [create a new finding](work-with-model-findings.qmd#add-project-findings). 

7. Under **Risk Assessment Notes**, add any relevant notes that explain your assessment further. 

A compliance summary gets shown for each subsection under **2. Validation** and provides a quick overview for current qualitative and quantitative risk assessments:
