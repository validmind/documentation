## Release highlights

This release includes a number of major enhancements to the ValidMind Developer Framework, a new NLP notebook, and a new template editing feature in the Platform UI. 

### ValidMind Developer Framework (v1.15.4)

- **Integrate external test providers**. You can now use your own external test providers to use custom tests with the Validmind Developer Framework. We provide a couple of demo scenarios with such test providers and show how you can register them with  Validmind so that they can run a template utilizing your tests. [Learn more ...](../notebooks/external_test_providers_demo.ipynb)

- **Implement your own custom tests.** With support for custom tests, you can now extend the default set of metrics provided by ValidMind which provides the flexibility to use our Developer Framework to document any type of model or use case. [Learn more ...](../notebooks/how_to/implementing_custom_tests.ipynb)

<!--- NR if the following text is inaccurate, https://github.com/validmind/documentation/pull/102 will also need to be updated --->
- **Simplified testing using templates**. Templates now function as a test suite and lay out the structure of model documentation, segmented into various sections and sub-sections. ValidMind templates come with pre-defined sections, similar to test placeholders, including boilerplates and spaces designated for documentation and test results. Our platform now scans these templates, identifies all tests and systematically organizes them into a well-structured test suite. [Learn more ...](developer-framework-introduction.qmd)

- **New natural language processing (NLP) data analysis and binary classification notebook**. Learn how to perform NLP data analysis and binary classification on COVID-19 tweets using the PyTorch library. The emphasis of this notebooks is on the in-depth analysis and preprocessing of the text data, in this case, tweets. [Learn more ...](../notebooks/nlp/nlp_sentiment_analysis_demo.ipynb)

### ValidMind Platform UI

- **You can now edit the documentation templates that get used for model documentation or for validation reports**. This feature is relevant for administrators who need to configure templates for specific use cases or where the existing templates supplied by ValidMind need to be customized. [Learn more ...](edit-templates.qmd)

- We improved the search feature in the Platform UI to make search results more compact.

## Enhancements

We revised our Quickstart guide to be more modular and to highlight that our suggested starting point with the ValidMind Developer Framework is now Jupyter Hub. [Learn more ...](quickstart.qmd)
