Let's take a look at how the Developer Framework works hand-in-hand with the ValidMind Platform and how documentation and test results get uploaded. 

The ValidMind Platform is the central place to: 

  - View results and documentation uploaded via the Developer Framework
  - Collaborate with other model developers, model reviewers and validators, and other users involved in the documentation and validation workflow

## Steps

1. [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_ui >}}).

2. Click **Model Inventory**.

3. Locate or search for the `[Quickstart] Customer Churn Model - Initial Validation` and select it.

   On the model details page that open, you can find important information about the model, such as:

    - The ID of the model and its specific use case
    - The owners, developers, validators, and business unit associated with the model
    - The risk tier and current version
    - And more

4. Scroll down to **Documentation Project History** and select the model.

   On the project overview page that opens, you can see what is included, such as model, project findings, recent activity, and project stakeholders, and more. In the left sidebar, you can find links to the documentation, project findings, validation report, audit trail, and client integration.

   For this Quickstart, we will focus on the **Documentation** section to show you how content from the Developer Framework gets uploaded. 

   Note that the model status is **In Documentation**. This is the status that a model starts in as part of a documentation project. You can click **See workflow** to look at what the full workflow is, from documentation, to validation, to review, and finally approval. 

5. In the left sidebar, select **Documentation** > **2. Data preparation** > **2.1. Data description**.

   This content is _generated_ by the ValidMind Developer Framework and provides information about the dataset used, including histograms, information about dataset quality, and test results.

   Sections that need your attention get flagged with `Requires Attention`. These sections get flagged _automatically_ by the Developer Framework whenever a test result is above or below a certain threshold.

6. In the left sidebar, select **3. Model Development** and any of the subsection to see information that has been uploaded by the Developer Framework about:

   - Model training
   - Model evaluation
   - Model explainability and interpretability
   - Model diagnosis

   The **Documentation Guidelines** in the **ValidMind Insights** right sidebar can tell you more about what these sections mean and help you with the task of documenting the model.

7. Finally, take a look at section **4. Monitoring and Governance**. 

   Sections like **4.1 Monitoring Plan** are not generated by the Developer Framework, but they get added by the model developer in the Platform UI.
