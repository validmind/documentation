## About our Jupyter notebooks
**Notebooks from ValidMind are safe to run** — If you get a warning that this notebook was not authored by Google, we welcome you to inspect the notebook source.

**Runtime errors** — We recommend that you not use the *Run all* option. Run each cell individually to see what is happening in the notebook. If you do see errors, re-run the notebook cells.
