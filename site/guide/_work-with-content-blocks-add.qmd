3. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.

4. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Documentation** or **Validation Report**.

   You can now jump to any section of the model documentation or validation report by expanding the table of contents on the left and selecting the relevant section you would like to add content to, such as **1.1 Model Overview**. 

5. Hover your mouse over the space where you want your new block to go until a horizontal dashed line with a {{< fa square-plus >}} sign appears that indicates you can insert a new block:

    ![](../guide/add-content-block.gif){width=90%}

6. Click {{< fa square-plus >}} and then select one of the available options: 
    
    - **Simple text block**: Adds a new section with a blank content block. After the new content block has been added, click {{< fa pencil >}} to edit the contents of the section like any other.
    - **Test-driven block**: Select one of the options:
        - **Metric**: Select one of the available metrics, such as **Confusion Matrix**.
        - **Threshold test**: Select one of the available threshold tests, such as **Data Quality: Skewness** or **Model Diagnosis: Overfit Regions**.
    
7. For test-driven blocks, a preview of the available metrics or threshold test gets shown. Click **Insert module** when you are ready.

After you have completed these steps, the new content block becomes a part of your model documentation.
