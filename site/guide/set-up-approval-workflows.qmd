### The default documentation workflow

Out of the box, the model documentation workflow is configured like this:

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[In documentation] --> B[In validation]
    B --> C[In review /<br>under approval]
    C --> D[Approved]
```

In documentation
: Your model developers use the ValidMind Developer Framework to runÂ validation tests and generate automated model documentation. They then use the ValidMind UI to populate qualitative documentation sections. This phase is the most critical and involved for model developers. 

To learn more about documenting models, see [Get started with the developer framework](get-started-developer-framework.qmd).

In validation
: Your model validators review the model documentation and challenge the model:
   
   - Collaborate in the ValidMind UI to facilitate question and answer threads to collect more information from model developers.
   - Challenge the model with the ValidMind Developer Framework to replicate test results and conduct your own testing.
   
   Validators then use the ValidMind UI to generate a validation report and manage the findings discovered during the model review process.

In review / under approval
: Senior risk managers and executives use the ValidMind UI to review validation report and findings to make a final decision. 
   
   The generated validation report contains detailed information about the models being evaluated, including their underlying assumptions, methodologies, and performance metrics. It also highlights any potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities that may be present in the models. 

Approved
: Approval signifies the final endorsement and authorization for a model to be used in production. Approval occurs after careful examination and validation of the model, ensuring that it meets institutional standards and guidelines, and regulatory requirements.
