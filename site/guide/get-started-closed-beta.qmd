_Thank you for joining ValidMind's closed beta! We hope that you will find our beta program an engaging experience. Let us know what we can do to help you make the most of your time with us._

## What’s in the closed beta?

Most of our large language model (LLM) testing and documentation generation features will be available for you to test during the closed beta. This includes both the ValidMind Model Documentation Automation and AI Risk Management platform. 

Practically, this means you will interact with our Developer Framework through Jupyter notebooks to run sample code. You will also log into our cloud-based Platform UI to look at the output the Developer Framework generated as part of running the sample code. The Jupyter notebooks we provide are meant to be self-documenting, meaning they include most everything you need to know to run them. 

If you have never tried our products, you can also spend a few minutes reading [What do I use the ValidMind platform for?](get-started.qmd#what-do-i-use-the-validmind-platform-for). And for the beta specifically, these blog posts provide a bit more context:

## Timeline 

Our closed beta program is running in two major phases:

October 3 - October 20: Friends & family
: _Sign-up is CLOSED_ 

A small group of select closed beta participants who get to try out our LLM functionality hot off the press. Expect regular closed beta updates, individual kick-off sessions, and some rough edges as we continue to refine our LLM functionality. 

October 23 - November 10: Wider audience
: _Sign-up is OPEN_ 

A larger group of closed beta participants who will benefit from the improvements made during the first phase of testing. If you know of anyone who might be interested in joining our closed beta, please refer them to our signup page: [Join our Closed Beta for LLM Testing](join-closed-beta.qmd).

## Getting started

Step-by-step instructions for testing: 

<!--- TO DO Do we need the OW folks to follow this step? --->
1. Get your credentials for the Platform UI by signing up with ValidMind: <https://app.prod.validmind.ai/>
   
   This is the login URL for our Platform UI where you can look at the model inventory and documentation projects for the different models. 

2. When you receive your access credentials, make sure you can log into the Platform UI.

3. Book a kick-off session with ValidMind by emailing <info@validmind.ai>.

4. Try the closed beta Jupyter notebooks for LLM functionality:

   - [Where to test](#where-to-test)

5. Provide feedback (or get help) by:
   
   - [Joining our community Slack](#join-our-community-slack)
   - [Opening a support ticket](#support)

### What to test

We provide Jupyter notebooks that include the code you can run: 

| Available | Notebook | Model Inventory |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Oct 3 | [quickstart_customer_churn_full_suite.ipynb](../notebooks/quickstart_customer_churn_full_suite.ipynb)<br>Useful if you have never tried ValidMind before. Walks you through the basics of our Developer Framework and the Platform UI. | [Demo] Customer Churn Model Documentation — Full Suite
| Oct 3 | [prompt_validation_demo.ipynb](../notebooks/llm/)<br>Guides you through using ValidMind for running and documenting prompt validation tests for a large language model (LLM) specialized in sentiment analysis for financial news. | [Demo] Foundation Model - Text Sentiment Analysis or [Demo] Foundation Model - Text Summarization
| COMING SOON | foundation_models_integration_demo.ipynb | [Demo] Foundation Model - Text Sentiment Analysis
| COMING SOON | hugging_face_integration_demo.ipynb | [Demo] Hugging Face - Text Sentiment Analysis
| COMING SOON | foundation_models_summarization_demo.ipynb | [Demo] Foundation Model - Text Summarization
| COMING SOON | hugging_face_summarization_demo.ipynb | [Demo] Hugging Face - Text Summarization
| COMING SOON | tutorial_time_series_forecasting.ipynb | [Demo] Interest Rate Time Series Forecasting Model
| COMING SOON | N/A | Credit Risk Model


### Where to test

### Developer Framework

Jupyter notebooks (code samples) are available in: [Jupyter Hub](https://jupyterhub.validmind.ai) 

Alternatively, you can download the notebooks locally and try them out in your own developer environment.

### Platform UI

Jupyter notebooks will often tell you where to look specifically after you run the sample code, but the login for the Platform UI is always the same: <https://app.prod.validmind.ai/>

## Provide feedback
 
### Join our community Slack

Have feedback or questions? We sponsor a Slack community and have set up a dedicated channel for the closed beta: [#community-beta](https://validmind.slack.com/archives/C05TVKK1L30). We welcome your input.

Our Slack community is not just for our products but also aims to foster discussions between AI risk practitioners and those involved in model risk management (MRM). Feel free to take a look around the other channels that are available and stay a while. 

### Open a support ticket

To get help from a human during the closed beta, send an email to <support@validmind.ai>.
