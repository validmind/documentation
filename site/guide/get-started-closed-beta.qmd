_Thank you for joining ValidMind's closed beta! We hope that you will find our beta program an engaging experience. Let us know what we can do to help you make the most of your time with us._

## What’s in the closed beta?

Most of our large language model (LLM) testing and documentation generation features will be available for you to test during the closed beta. This includes both the ValidMind Model Documentation Automation and AI Risk Management platform. 

Practically, this means you will interact with our developer framework through Jupyter notebooks to run sample code. You will also log into our cloud-based Platform UI to look at the output the developer framework generated as part of running the sample code. The Jupyter notebooks we provide are meant to be self-documenting, meaning they include most everything you need to know to run them. 

If you have never tried our products, you can also spend a few minutes reading [What do I use the ValidMind platform for?](get-started.qmd#what-do-i-use-the-validmind-platform-for). And for the beta specifically, these blog posts provide a bit more context:

- [Closed Beta Preview: Prompt Validation for LLMs](https://validmind.com/closed-beta-preview-prompt-validation-for-llms/)

## Timeline 

Our closed beta program is running in two major phases:

::: {.grid}
::: {.g-col-6}
Early Access: Friends & family
: _Sign-up is CLOSED_ 

Starting in early October, we are inviting a small group of select closed beta participants to try out our LLM functionality hot off the press. 

Expect regular closed beta updates, individual kick-off sessions, and some rough edges as we continue to refine our LLM functionality. 
:::

::: {.g-col-6}
Wider audience: All closed beta participants
: _Sign-up is OPEN_ 

A larger group of closed beta participants that will benefit from the improvements made during the first phase of testing. If you know of anyone who might be interested in joining our closed beta, please refer them to our signup page:

## Getting started

Step-by-step instructions for testing: 

<!--- TO DO Do we need the OW folks to follow this step? --->
1. Get your credentials for the Platform UI by signing up with ValidMind: <https://app.prod.validmind.ai/>
   
   This is the login URL for our Platform UI where you can look at the model inventory for the different models. 

2. When you receive your access credentials, make sure you can log into the Platform UI.

3. Book a kick-off session with ValidMind by emailing <info@validmind.ai>.

4. Try the closed beta Jupyter notebooks for LLM functionality:

   - [Where to test](#where-to-test)

5. Provide feedback or get help:
   
   - [Join our community Slack](#join-our-community-slack)
   - [Open a support ticket](#support)

### What to test

We provide Jupyter notebooks that include sample code you can run directly with the ValidMind Developer Framework: 

::: {.callout-important}
## What is "Yes"?
Throughout the early access for friends and family, we will update this table, so check back on a weekly basis.<br><br>Can't wait? Much of the sample code in the notebooks is already on Jupyter Hub, though it may not be as easily consumable.

### Where to test

#### Developer framework

Jupyter notebooks (code samples) are available in: [Jupyter Hub](https://jupyterhub.validmind.ai) 

Alternatively, you can download the notebooks locally and try them out in your own developer environment.

#### Platform UI

Jupyter notebooks will often tell you where to look specifically after you run the sample code, but the login for the Platform UI is always the same: <https://app.prod.validmind.ai/> 

## Provide feedback
 
### Join our community Slack

Have feedback or questions? We sponsor a Slack community and have set up a dedicated channel for the closed beta: [#community-beta](https://validmind.slack.com/archives/C05TVKK1L30). We welcome your input.

Our Slack community is not just for our products but also aims to foster discussions between AI risk practitioners and those involved in model risk management (MRM). Feel free to take a look around the other channels that are available and stay a while. 

### Open a support ticket

To get help from a human during the closed beta, send an email to <support@validmind.ai>.
