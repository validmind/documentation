To try out ValidMind, you need to be a registered user on the ValidMind Platform. If you don't already have access, check out our [Release access](release-access.qmd) page.

## Prerequisites

To upload from the Developer Framework and to collaborate with others in the ValidMind Platform UI, you must have network access to the `validmind.ai` domain. If necessary, ask a network administrator to add our domain to your firewall allowlist (whitelist). 

If you also require VPC access from your company network to ValidMind, you can [configure AWS PrivateLink](configure-aws-privatelink.qmd).

### Developer Framework

To follow the Quickstart, you must be able to access [Google Colaboratory (Colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/) where you can run our sample notebooks for free. 

To try our [sample Jupyter notebooks](jupyter-notebooks.qmd) locally after you download them from Colab requires Python 3.8+. 

### Validmind Platform UI

You need to be able to access our ValidMind Platform UI in a modern browser such as Google Chrome, Apple Safari, or Mozilla Firefox.
