Manage lifecycle processes within your {{< var vm_platform >}} setup using workflows and transitions.

## Prerequisites

- The model is already [registered in the model inventory](register-models-in-model-inventory.qmd)
- You've already [customized your resource statuses](customize-resource-statuses.qmd) for use in workflows
- [Workflows have already been set up for use](set-up-workflows.qmd) with your models

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
Depending on the configuration of your workflows, you may or may not be able to move a model into another workflow state as actions can be gated to only users of certain roles. 
:::

## Review model workflow

1. [Log in to the {{< var vm_platform >}}]({{< var vm_url >}}).

2. In the left sidebar, click [**Model Inventory**]({{< var vm_url >}}/model-inventory).

3. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.

4. On the landing page that appears for your model, locate Model Status.

    - Click **{{< fa arrow-right >}} See workflow** to open the detailed workflow associated with that model.
    - The current workflow state will be highlighted on this detail view.

## Transition workflow status

1. [Log in to the {{< var vm_platform >}}]({{< var vm_url >}}).

2. In the left sidebar, click [**Model Inventory**]({{< var vm_url >}}/model-inventory).

3. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.

4. If an action is available to your role, you'll see it listed in the Actions section on this landing page. Click **{{< fa arrow-right >}}** to open up the Transition panel for your selected action:

    - This arrow will be followed by the action name. 
    - On the Transition panel, enter a Note then click **Submit**. 
    - A toast will indicate that your status has been successfully transitioned.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
When all the actions that can be performed by your role are completed for that model at that stage of the workflow, the Actions section will disappear from view.
