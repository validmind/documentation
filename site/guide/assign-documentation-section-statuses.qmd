Assign a completion status to individual sections of your model documentation that will be reflected in your Document Overview.

## Prerequisites
- You hold the `Developer` role 
- The model is already [registered in the model inventory](register-models-in-model-inventory.qmd)

## Steps

1. [Log in to the {{< var vm_platform >}}]({{< var vm_url >}}).

2. In the left sidebar, click [**Model Inventory**]({{< var vm_url >}}/model-inventory).

3. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.

4. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Documentation**.

   Jump to any section of the model documentation by selecting the relevant section you would like to view.

5. Next to the heading of each section, you can assign a status from the drop-down:
    - In Progress
    - Done

The documentation completion status summary will then be updated on your Document Overview page.
