QMD: General getting started w/ initializing developer framework and runnning a simple test via intro notebook ()
Then next steps will be getting started with their own model, for FR it will be time series notebook.
Notebooks are tutorials or how-tos, they are NOT reference! So the notebooks need to move around in the docs
    Could split the getting started up into sections for Developers, Validators, and Admins (and likely get rid of the Guide section)

The model developer is responsible for developing, implementing, and maintaining the model. They are typically subject matter experts in the domain of the model and are responsible for ensuring the model is fit-for-purpose, accurate, and aligned with the business requirements.

## Prerequisites

The Developer Framework requires access to the data sources where datasets (training, test, and other applicable datasets) and trained model files are stored to run model documentation and validation tests, and to ValidMindâ€™s SaaS platform to populate the model documentation and validation report.

Make sure Python and support for Jupyter notebooks is installed on your machine.
