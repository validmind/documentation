You are now ready to modify the Quickstart notebook to upload to your own project that you created earlier.

## Steps

1. Reopen the Quickstart notebook you accessed earlier.

2. In the Quickstart notebook, replace the `vm.init()` lines that look like the following with your own client integration information from the earlier step when you created your new documentation project:

3. Run each cell in the notebook:

   - Hover over each cell and click the {{< fa circle-play >}} **icon**; OR
   - Press `Shift + Enter` on Windows or `Cmd + Enter` if you are on a Mac
   
   The notebook will install the ValidMind library and then connect to your own documentation project in the ValidMind Platform.

You can now switch back to the Platform UI and view the documentation that has been created by the data and artifacts provided by the Developer Framework.
