Let's learn how to create your own documentation project. You can use this project to upload tests and documentation and then add that to the Quickstart notebook you looked at earlier.

## Steps

1. Navigate to the landing page by clicking on the ValidMind logo or [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_ui >}}).
   
2. From the left sidebar, select **Documentation Projects** and on the page that opens, click the **Create new Project** button at top right of the screen.
   
3. Select the right options in the form:

   ![](create-project.png)

   - **Model**: `[Quickstart] Customer Churn Model`
   - **Type**: `Initial Validation` (selected automatically)
<!---   - **Model Use Case**: `Attrition/Churn Management` (under `Marketing/Sales`). --->
   - **Project name**: Enter your preferred name

4. Click **Create Project**.

   ValidMind will create an empty documentation project associated with the customer churn model. 
   
   You can now access this project from the UI on the **Documentation Projects** page or by navigating to the relevant model - `[Quickstart] Customer Churn Model` - in the **Model Inventory** page.

5. From the left sidebar, select **Client Integration**. 

   The page that opens provides you with the credentials for the newly created project to use with the ValidMind Developer Framework. 

6. Locate the project identifier, API key, and secret:

   - `api_host`: The location of the ValidMind API
   - `api_key`: The account API key
   - `api_secret`: The account secret key
   - `project`: The project identifier

   The code snippet can be copied and pasted directly into your developer source code to integrate the ValidMind Developer Framework and to be able to upload to the ValidMind Platform. 
   
   To follow best practices, you can also store the credentials in a `.env` file and pass them in via environment variables.
