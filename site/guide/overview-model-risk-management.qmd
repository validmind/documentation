## Benefits

ValidMind offers a comprehensive platform designed to meet the regulatory compliance and model risk management (MRM) needs of financial institutions. 

Each regulation emphasizes governance, model validation, and controls to ensure robust model risk management and effective ongoing monitoring.

### Regulatory compliance 

The design of our platform aligns with guidelines such as SR 11-7, CP6/22, and Guideline E-23, ensuring models are developed, implemented, and maintained with minimal risk. 

How our platform helps you with regulatory compliance:

SR 11-7: Guidance on Model Risk Management (U.S.): 
:This U.S. regulation focuses on robust model risk management for banks and financial institutions. It outlines three core components: 
   
   1. Model development, implementation, and use: Ensures that models are developed and implemented correctly.
   2. Model validation: Requires rigorous testing and validation of models.
   3. Governance and controls: Stresses the importance of governance structures and control mechanisms.
   
   The regulation also mandates ongoing monitoring and periodic reviews to ensure models remain valid and effective.

CP6/22 – Model risk management principles for banks (UK)
: This UK regulation adopts a principles-based approach and applies to banks and building societies. It covers four main areas:
   
   1. Model risk governance: Establishes the governance structures needed for effective model risk management.
   2. Model inventory: Requires institutions to maintain an inventory of all models.
   3. Model validation: Mandates independent validation of models.
   4. Internal audit: Requires an internal audit to assess model risk management.
   
   The regulation encourages a proportionate application of these principles based on the size and complexity of the institution.

Guideline-E23: Enterprise-Wide Model Risk Management for Deposit-Taking Institutions (Canada)
: This Canadian regulation applies to a range of deposit-taking institutions and emphasizes an enterprise-wide approach to model risk management. It covers:
   
   1. Model development, validation, approval, review, modification, and decommission: Provides a comprehensive framework for the entire lifecycle of a model.
   2. Differentiation between institutions: Makes a distinction between institutions that have internal models approved for regulatory capital purposes (IMAIs) and other standardized institutions (SIs), with different compliance expectations for each.
   
   Each of these regulations aims to ensure that financial models are developed, implemented, and maintained in a manner that minimizes risk and complies with governance standards.

### Governance
ValidMind provides robust features that are in alignment with the strong emphasis that regulations place on governance and controls. The platform includes workflows for various stages of approval, thereby fulfilling the formal approval processes that are often mandated by regulatory guidelines. This ensures that models are developed, validated, and deployed within a controlled and well-governed environment.

Model validation and approval
: ValidMind offers automated features that ensure models meet the effective validation criteria as mandated by regulations. The platform is also equipped with comprehensive risk assessment tools, allowing institutions to conduct thorough evaluations of model-related risks. Additionally, ValidMind includes an inventory feature that allows for the cataloging of all models used within an organization, which is a requirement often stipulated in regulatory guidelines.

Documentation
: ValidMind has built-in features that facilitate the generation of comprehensive and thorough documentation. This includes the recording of all relevant information, such as assumptions, methodologies, data inputs, performance evaluations, and limitations. This level of detail in documentation not only meets but often exceeds the requirements set forth by regulatory bodies.

Monitoring
: For monitoring (and materiality assessment), ValidMind offers real-time analytics and performance tracking features. These capabilities are in line with the ongoing monitoring requirements often found in regulatory guidelines. The platform also allows for the classification of models based on their risk levels, thereby meeting the need for materiality assessments as emphasized by regulations.

### Best Practices
ValidMind also serves as a tool for implementing best practices in Model Risk Management. For model developers, who serve as the first line of defense against model risk, the platform offers a range of tools that facilitate the documentation and testing of models, especially those that are subject to regulations. For model validators, who serve as the second line of defense, ValidMind provides the capabilities to independently validate models and ensure that the organization's MRM principles are implemented throughout the model lifecycle.

Model Documentation Automation
: One of the standout benefits of using ValidMind is the automation of model documentation. The platform enables this through configurable documentation templates and model test plans. This level of automation ensures that all necessary information is captured and recorded in a consistent and accurate manner. It also significantly reduces the risk of errors or omissions in the documentation. Furthermore, this automation streamlines the entire model lifecycle and minimizes the amount of time and resources required to produce reliable and accurate documentation.

Communication and Tracking
: ValidMind comes with built-in functionality that facilitates communication and tracking between various stakeholders. This feature offers an effective way of ensuring that all parties involved have a clear and comprehensive understanding of the models being used, their limitations, and the associated risks. The built-in communication tools also facilitate collaboration among stakeholders. By working together, they can develop effective strategies for managing model risk and ensuring that models are used in an appropriate and responsible manner.

Management of Model Lifecycle and Custom Workflows
: Another benefit of using ValidMind is its ability to manage the model lifecycle effectively. The platform provides a configurable workflow that simplifies the management and control over the entire model risk management process. Organizations have the flexibility to customize this workflow to fit their specific needs and requirements. This provides a structured approach to identify and manage the risks associated with various models, thereby enhancing stakeholder confidence in the organization's ability to manage risk effectively.
