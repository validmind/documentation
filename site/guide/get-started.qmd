The easiest way to get started with ValidMind is to try out our developer framework and explore the SaaS platform UI. 

## Try out the developer framework

For model developers, we recommend that you try our introductory notebooks to learn how you initialize the developer framework, use a demo dataset, run test plans, train a model, and send information to the ValidMind SaaS platform.

See the notebooks in action:

- [ValidMind Python Library Introduction](../notebooks/intro.ipynb)
- [ValidMind Python Library Introduction (for R users)](../notebooks/intro-r.ipynb)

<!-- TO DO we need to add a download link here --->
Try it yourself:

```{=html}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Download notebook</title>
    <style>
        button {
            display: inline-block;
            background-color: #DE257E;
            color: white;
            border: none;
            padding: 12px 24px;
            font-size: 16px;
            font-weight: bold;
            border-radius: 4px;
            cursor: pointer;
            box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
            transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;
            margin-bottom: 20px;
        }

        button:hover {
            background-color: #c71e6b;
            box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <a href="https://github.com/validmind/documentation/tree/main/site/notebooks" download>
        <button>Download notebook source</button>
    </a>

```

After you download the source for the introductory notebooks, you can make changes locally in your own developer environment and run the notebooks.

## Explore the SaaS platform

For model developers and owners 

For model validators and , the SaaS UI provides 

: Review and evaluate models and model documentation to ensure they comply with organizational and regulatory requirements.

<!---
Track your model inventory — Manage the model lifecycle, track the workflow status for models, plan for upcoming validation dates, and more.
Work on validation projects — Collaborate with developers and validators to review documentation, add findings, keep track of review statuses, and generate validation reports.
Configure workflows — Set up ValidMind to follow your existing model risk management processes, manage statuses for different parts of the workflow, and get an end-to-end view of workflows and who is involved.
Work with templates — Configure required validation tests and standardize the documentation table of contents for specific model use cases.
Integrate with your stack — Import and export model documentation and validation reports.
