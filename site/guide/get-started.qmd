## How do I get access to ValidMind? 

If you are new to our products, you will need access. Check our [**Releases**](release-pilot.qmd) page.

## How do I get started?

The fastest way to explore what ValidMind can offer is with our [**Quickstart**](quickstart.qmd).

The quickstart takes about 15 minutes to complete and walks you through the Developer Framework with some sample Jupyter notebooks for models and introduces you to the ValidMind UI.

If you have already tried the quickstart, how-to instructions for different users are in our [**Guides**](guide.qmd):

- [**For platform administrators**](guide.qmd) — Learn how to configure the platform, from setting up connectivity via AWS PrivateLink, to customizing the ValidMind Platform to suit your exisiting workflows, and more. 

- [**For model developers**](developers.qmd) — Learn how to learn how you initialize the Developer Framework in your own environment, add documentation, and run test plans.    Also check the [**Guides**](guide.qmd) for how you collaborate with model validators.

- [**For model validators**](guide.qmd) — Learn how to step through the approval process after review and generate validation reports as you collaborate with model developers.
