## Welcome to ValidMind!

ValidMind is a platform designed to simplify key aspects of managing the risk for AI and machine learning models for model developers and model validators alike. 

## How do I get access to ValidMind? 

If you want to try out our products, [request a trial](https://validmind.com/demo).

## What is the ValidMind platform?

<!--- TO DO Need to create a variant that shows "review documentation", "generate validation reports" from the basic workflow ---> 

![](get-started-validmind.png){width=70% fig-align="center" fig-alt="An image showing the two main components of ValidMind. The Developer Framework that integrates with your existing developer environment, and the ValidMind MRM platform."}

ValidMind provides two main products components: 

1. The **Developer Framework** is a library of tools and methods designed to automate model documentation and testing. It is platform agnostic, and integrates with your existing model development environment. 

   For Python developers, a simple install gets you all of the functions:
    
   ```bash
   pip install validmind
   ```

2. The **ValidMind Platform** is an easy-to-use web-based UI that enables users to review and edit the documentation and test metrics generated by the Developer Framework online. It also enables collaboration and feedback capture between model developers and model validators, and offers workflow capabilities to manage the model documentation and validation process throughout the model lifecycle.

For more information about the benefits that ValidMind can offer, check out the [ValidMind overview](overview.qmd).

## Key ValidMind concepts

{{< include key-validmind-concepts.qmd >}}

## How do I get started?

On the ValidMind platform, everything starts with the model inventory: you register a new model and manage the model's lifecycle through the different activities that are part of your existing model risk management process.

Model information and associated objects are handled through the model and documentation lifecycle workflows which you can configure to follow your internal risk and compliance policies. 

Out of the box, the high-level workflow looks like this:

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[1. New model<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;registration] --> B[2. Initial<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;validation]
    B --> C[3. Validation<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;approval]
    C --> D[4. In production]
    D --> E[5. Periodic review<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and revalidation]
```
<br>

1. **New model registration**: 

   - Model owners and validators can use the model inventory feature to *manage all metadata* associated with a model, including compliance and regulatory attributes.
   - Users select a *documentation template* when registering a new inventory model.

2. **Initial validation**:  is represented by node B.

3. **Validation approval**: is represented by node C.

4. **In production**: is represented by node D.

5. **Periodic review and revalidation**: is represented by node E.
