The easiest way to get started with ValidMind is to try out our developer framework and explore the SaaS platform UI. 

## Try out the developer framework

For model developers, we recommend that you try our introductory notebooks to learn how you initialize the developer framework, use a demo dataset, run test plans, train a model, and send information to the ValidMind SaaS platform.

See the notebooks in action:

- [ValidMind Python Library Introduction](../notebooks/intro.ipynb)
- [ValidMind Python Library Introduction (for R users)](../notebooks/intro-r.ipynb)

<!-- TO DO we need to add the correct download link here --->

Try it yourself:

```

With the notebook source, you can try out changes locally in your own developer environment and run the notebooks. Requires Python 3.8+.

## Explore the SaaS platform

You use the SaaS UI to collaborate with model developers, owners, validators, and others involved in the on the model lifecycle.

Here's how to get started: 

1. [Log in](login.qmd).

2. For model developers:
    a. [Verify uploads](verify-developer-framework-uploads.qmd) 
    
       Check the documentation, metrics, and test results uploaded by the developer framework.

    b. [Create a new project](create-project.qmd).
    
       Learn what the initial workflow looks like.

3. For model validators:

    a. [Review model documentation](review-model-documentation.qmd).

       Collaborate with model developers on model documentation and add findings.

<!---
    b. [Generate a model validation report](generate-validation-reports.qmd).

       Step through the approval process after review.
