## How do I get access to ValidMind? 

If you are new to our products, you will need access. Check our [**Releases**](release-access.qmd) page.

## How do I get started?

The fastest way to explore what ValidMind can offer is with our [**Quickstart**](quickstart.qmd).

The Quickstart takes about 15 minutes to complete and walks you through the Developer Framework with a sample Jupyter notebook and introduces you to the ValidMind Platform.

If you have already tried the Quickstart, how-to instructions for different users are in our [**Guides**](guide.qmd):

- [**For platform administrators**](guide.qmd) — Learn how to configure the platform, from setting up connectivity via AWS PrivateLink, to customizing the ValidMind Platform to suit your exisiting workflows, and more. 

- [**For model developers**](developer-framework.qmd) — Find information for ValidMind test plans and tests, additional Jupyter notebooks, and the ValidMind Developer Framework reference.

   Also check the [**Guides**](guide.qmd) for how you integrate the Developer Framework in your own environment, add documentation, and collaborate with model validators.

- [**For model validators**](guide.qmd) — Learn how to step through the approval process after review and generate validation reports as you collaborate with model developers.
