## Welcome to ValidMind!

ValidMind is a platform designed to streamline the management of risk for AI models, including those used in machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and large language models (LLMs). The platform offers tools that cater to both model developers and validators, simplifying key aspects of model risk management.

## What do I use the ValidMind platform for?

Model developers and validators play important roles in managing model risk, including risk that stems from generative AI and machine learning models. From complying with regulations to ensuring that institutional standards are followed, your team members are tasked with the careful documentation, testing, and independent validation of models.

The purpose of these efforts is to ensure that good risk management principles are followed throughout the model lifecycle. To assist you with these processes of documenting and validating models, ValidMind provides a number of tools that you can employ regardless of the technology used to build your models.

The ValidMind AI risk platform provides two main products components: 

1. The **developer framework** is a library of tools and methods designed to automate generating model documentation and running validation tests. The framework is designed to be platform agnostic and integrates with your existing development environment. 

   For Python developers, a single installation command provides access to all the functions:
    
   ```bash
   pip install validmind
   ```

2. The **ValidMind Platform UI** is an easy-to-use web-based UI that enables you to track the model lifecycle:

- Customize workflows to manage the model documentation and validation process.
- Review and edit the documentation and test metrics generated by the developer framework.
- Collaborate with and capture feedback from model developers and model validators.
- Generate validation reports and approvals

## How do I get started?

On the ValidMind platform, everything starts with the model inventory: you first register a new model and then manage the model lifecycle through the different activities that are part of your existing model risk management processes.

### Approval workflow

A typical high-level model approval workflow looks like this:

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[Model<br>registration] --> B[Initial<br>validation]
    B --> C[Validation<br>approval]
    C --> D[In production]
    D --> E[Periodic review<br>and revalidation]
    E --> B
```
<br>

New model registration
: Select a documentation template when registering a new inventory model to start your model documentation. You then use the model inventory to manage the metadata associated with the model, including all compliance and regulatory attributes. 

**Initial validation**
: Triggers a new [documentation workflow](#documentation-workflow) to yield a model that will be ready for production deployment after its documentation and validation reports have been approved. 

**Validation approval**
: Perform validation of the model to ensure that it meets the needs for which it was designed. You can also connect to third-party systems to send events when a model has been approved for production.

**In production**
: Use the model in production while ensuring its ongoing reliability, accuracy, and compliance with regulations by monitoring the model's performance.

**Periodic review and revalidation**
: As part of regular performance monitoring or change management, you follow a process similar to that seen in the **Initial validation** step.

### Documentation workflow

Out of the box, the model documentation workflow is configured like this:

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[In documentation] --> B[In validation]
    B --> C[In review /<br>under approval]
    C --> D[Approved]
```
<br>

In documentation
: Your model developers use the ValidMind Developer Framework to run validation tests and generate automated model documentation. They then use the ValidMind UI to populate qualitative documentation sections. This phase is the most critical and involved for model developers. 

To learn more about documenting models, see [Get started with the developer framework](get-started-developer-framework.qmd).

In validation
: Your model validators review the model documentation and challenge the model:
   
   - Collaborate in the ValidMind UI to facilitate question and answer threads to collect more information from model developers.
   - Challenge the model with the ValidMind Developer Framework to replicate test results and conduct your own testing.
   
   Validators then use the ValidMind UI to generate a validation report and manage the findings discovered during the model review process.

In review / under approval
: Senior risk managers and executives use the ValidMind UI to review validation report and findings to make a final decision. 
   
   The generated validation report contains detailed information about the models being evaluated, including their underlying assumptions, methodologies, and performance metrics. It also highlights any potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities that may be present in the models. 

Approved
: Approval signifies the final endorsement and authorization for a model to be used in production. Approval occurs after careful examination and validation of the model, ensuring that it meets institutional standards and guidelines, and regulatory requirements.
