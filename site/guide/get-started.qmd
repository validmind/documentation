## Welcome to ValidMind!

{{< fa thumbs-up >}}

ValidMind is a solution designed to help simplify and automate key aspects of model risk management (MRM) activities for model developers and model validators alike. The platform helps automate model documentation, validation, and testing. In addition, the platform offers with built-in communication and tracking features that enable all stakeholders to collaborate and communicate effectively throughout the model risk management process, ensuring that everyone is informed and up-to-date. 

## How does it work?

![](get-started-validmind.png){width=70% fig-align="center" fig-alt="An image showing the two main components of ValidMind. The Developer Framework that integrates with your existing developer environment, and the ValidMind MRM platform."}

ValidMind consists of two main products components: 

1. The **Developer Framework** is a library of tools and methods designed to automate model documentation and validation. It is platform agnostic, and integrates with the model development environment. 

2. The **ValidMind Platform** is an easy-to-use web-based UI that enables users to review and edit the documentation generated by the Developer Framework. It also enables collaboration and feedback capture between model developers and model validators, and offers workflow capabilities to manage the model documentation and validation process.
