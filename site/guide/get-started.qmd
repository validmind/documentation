## Welcome to ValidMind!

ValidMind is a platform designed to simplify key aspects of managing the risk for AI and machine learning models for model developers and model validators alike. 

## How do I get access to ValidMind? 

If you want to try out our products, [request a trial](https://validmind.com/demo).

## What is the ValidMind platform?

Model developers and validators play vital roles in managing model risk, especially when subject to regulations. They are tasked with the careful documentation, testing, and independent validation of the models they build, ensuring the firm's model risk management principles are implemented throughout the entire model lifecycle. 

ValidMind provides various tools to assist you in the process of documenting and validating models, regardless of the technology platform used to build them.

<!--- TO DO Need to create a variant that shows "review documentation", "generate validation reports" from the basic workflow --->

ValidMind provides two main products components: 

1. The **Developer Framework** is a library of tools and methods designed to automate generating model documentation and runnng validation tests. It is platform agnostic, and integrates with your existing model development environment. 

   For Python developers, a simple install gets you all of the functions:
    
   ```bash
   pip install validmind
   ```

2. The **ValidMind AI Risk Platform** is an easy-to-use web-based UI that enables you to track the model lifecycle:

- Customize workflows to manage the model documentation and validation process.
- Review and edit the documentation and test metrics generated by the Developer Framework.
- Collaborate and capture feedback between model developers and model validators.
- Generate validation reports and approvals

For more information about the benefits that ValidMind can offer, check out the [ValidMind overview](overview.qmd).

On the ValidMind platform, everything starts with the model inventory: you first [register a new model](register-models.qmd) and then manage the model lifecycle through the different activities that are part of your existing model risk management process.

Out of the box, the documentation project workflow for models looks like this:

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[In documentation] --> B[In validation]
    B --> C[In review /<br>under approval]
    C --> D[Approved]
```
<br>

In documentation
: Model developers use the ValidMind Developer Framework to runÂ validation tests and automate model documentation. They then use the ValidMind UI to populate qualitative documentation sections. This phase is the most critical and involved for model developers. 

To learn more about documenting models, see [Get started with the Developer Framework](get-started-developer-framework.qmd).

In validation
: Model validators review the model documentation and challenge the model:
   
   - By using ValidMind UI to drive Q & A comments and to collect more information from developers.
   - By using the ValidMind Developer Framework to replicate the test results and conduct their own testing.
   
   Validators then use the ValidMind UI to prepare a validation report and manage any findings discovered during the model review process.

In review / under approval
: Senior risk managers and executives use ValidMind UI to review validation report and findings to make a final decision. The validation report contains detailed information about the models being evaluated, including their underlying assumptions, methodologies, and performance metrics. It also highlights any potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities that may be present in the models. 

Approved
: Approval signifies the final endorsement and authorization for a model to be used in production. This phase occurs after careful examination and validation of the model, ensuring that it meets the predefined standards, guidelines, and regulatory requirements.
