The easiest way to get started with ValidMind is to try out our developer framework and explore the SaaS platform UI. 

## Try out the developer framework

For model developers, we recommend that you try our introductory notebooks to learn how you initialize the developer framework, use a demo dataset, run test plans, train a model, and send information to the ValidMind SaaS platform.

See the notebooks in action:

- [ValidMind Python Library Introduction](../notebooks/intro.ipynb)
- [ValidMind Python Library Introduction (for R users)](../notebooks/intro-r.ipynb)

<!-- TO DO we need to add a download link here --->
Try it yourself:

After you download the source for the introductory notebooks, you can make changes locally in your own developer environment and the notebooks.

## Explore the SaaS platform

For model developers and validators: Review and evaluate models and model documentation to ensure they comply with organizational and regulatory requirements.
