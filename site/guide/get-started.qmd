## Welcome to ValidMind!

ValidMind is a platform designed to help simplify key aspects of managing the risk for AI and machine learning models for model developers and model validators alike. 

## How do I get access to ValidMind? 

If you are new to our products, you will need access: [Request a trial](https://validmind.com/demo).

## What is the ValidMind platform?

<!--- TO DO replace with basic documentation workflow; the current graphic talks about things, but not about the tasks (moved graphic to dev framework section ) ---> 

The platform provides different tools for developers to document and validate models regardless of the technology platform used to build them. 

In addition, the platform offers built-in collaboration and tracking features that enable all stakeholders, including model validators and executives, to collaborate and communicate effectively throughout the model risk management lifecycle. 

<!--- TO DO Need to clean up this illustration --->

ValidMind provides two main products components: 

1. The **Developer Framework** is a library of tools and methods designed to automate model documentation and testing. It is platform agnostic, and integrates with the model development environment. 

   For Python developers, a simple install gets you all of the functions:
    
   ```bash
   pip install validmind
   ```

2. The **ValidMind Platform** is an easy-to-use web-based UI that enables users to review and edit the documentation and test metrics generated by the Developer Framework online. It also enables collaboration and feedback capture between model developers and model validators, and offers workflow capabilities to manage the model documentation and validation process.

For more information about the benefit ValidMind offers, check out our [ValidMind overview](overview.qmd).

## What are the key concepts?

## How do I get started?

On the ValidMind platform, everything starts with the model inventory: you register a new model and manage the model's lifecycle through the different activities that are part of your existing model risk management process.

Model information and associated objects are handled through the model and documentation lifecycle workflows which you can configure to follow your internal risk and compliance policies. 

Out of the box, the high-level workflow looks like this:

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[1. New model<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;registration] --> B[2. Initial validation]
    B --> C[3. Validation approval]
    C --> D[4. In production]
    D --> E[5. Periodic review<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and revalidation]
```
<br>

1. **New model registration**: is represented by node A.
2. **Initial validation**:  is represented by node B.
3. **Validation approval**: is represented by node C.
4. **In production**: is represented by node D.
5. **Periodic review and revalidation**: is represented by node E.
