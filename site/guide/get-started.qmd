## A wam welcome to ValidMind!

ValidMind is a platform designed to help simplify and automate key aspects of model risk management (MRM) activities for model developers and model validators alike. The platform lets you automate model documentation and testing, validation, and testing. In addition, the platform offers built-in collaboration and tracking features that enable all stakeholders to collaborate and communicate effectively throughout the model risk management lifecycle, ensuring that everyone is informed and up-to-date. 

<!---- 
ValidMind provides different tools for developers to document and validate models regardless of the technology platform used to build them. 

On the ValidMind platform, everything starts with the model inventory: users register new models and manage a model's lifecycle through the different activities of the firm's MRM (Model Risk Management) process.

The model's information and associated objects are managed through the model and documentation lifecycle workflows. Customers should define these workflows to follow internal risk and compliance policies strictly. In general, the model and documentation workflows look like this (only displaying the happy path for illustration purposes):

## How does it work?

<!--- TO DO replace with basic documentation workflow; the current graphic talks about things, but not about the tasks (moved graphic to dev framework section ) ---> 

ValidMind consists of two main products components: 

1. The **Developer Framework** is a library of tools and methods designed to automate model documentation and testing. It is platform agnostic, and integrates with the model development environment. For Python developers, a simple install gets you all of the functions:
    
    ```bash
    pip install validmind
   ```

2. The **ValidMind Platform** is an easy-to-use web-based UI that enables users to review and edit the documentation and test metrics generated by the Developer Framework online. It also enables collaboration and feedback capture between model developers and model validators, and offers workflow capabilities to manage the model documentation and validation process.
