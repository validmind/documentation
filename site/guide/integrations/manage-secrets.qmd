Secrets centralize the credentials your integrations need so you can reference encrypted secrets without pasting them into every connection configuration. You store each secret once and then reuse it across supported integrations.

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] You are assigned a role that can edit integrations settings, such as [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble}.[^1]
- [x] You collected the scoped credentials required by the external platform, for example a Jira personal access token, an MLflow username and password, or AWS access keys.

## Add secrets

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Go to **Integrations** > **Secrets**.

3. Click **{{< fa plus >}} Add Secret**.

4. Fill in the details:

   - **Secret name** — Enter an easily identifiable label that indicates which system the secret belongs to.
   - **Description** (optional) — Summarize when to use the secret or who owns it so other admins know whether it is safe to re-use.
   - **Secret value** — Paste the credential exactly as issued by the external system. The value is encrypted and never displays it in plaintext again.
   - **Expiration date** (optional) — Set a rotation reminder if the external system enforces key expiry.

5. Click **Create Secret**. 

The secret can now be selected when configuring connections.[^2]

## View details

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Go to **Integrations** > **Secrets**.

3. Click the secret you want to view.

## Edit secrets

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Go to **Integrations** > **Secrets**.

3. Click the secret you want to change.

4. In the modal that appears, click **Edit Secret**.

5. Make your changes. For example:

   - **Secret value** — Paste a new value if the external platform issued a replacement token.
   - **Expiration date** — Extend the expiry window if you want to keep the secret active for longer.

6. Click **Update Secret** to save your changes. 

## Revoke secrets

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Go to **Integrations** > **Secrets**.

3. Hover over the secret you want to change.

4. When **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** appears, click on it and select **{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Revoke**.

5. On the confirmation dialogue that appears, select **OK** to confirm revocation.

Revocation immediately disables the secret so it can no longer be used, but does not remove it.

## Delete secrets

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Go to **Integrations** > **Secrets**.

3. Hover over the secret you want to remove.

4. When **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** appears, click it, then select **{{< fa trash >}} Delete**.

5. In the confirmation dialog, select **OK** to confirm deletion.

Deletion removes the secret permanently so that it no longer appears on the platform.
