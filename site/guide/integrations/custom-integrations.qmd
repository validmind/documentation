Connect {{< var vm.product >}} to third-party systems that aren't supported out of the box by building custom integrations using the reference API.

Custom integrations let you link models or artifacts from internal registries, proprietary platforms, or any service you control to the {{< var vm.product >}} model inventory.

## How custom integrations work

A custom integration acts as a bridge between {{< var vm.product >}} and your external system:

1. You deploy a service that implements the {{< var vm.product >}} reference API endpoints.
2. You configure a custom integration in {{< var vm.product >}} that points to your service.
3. Users can then link models or artifacts from your service to records in the model inventory.

```

## Reference API

The reference API defines the HTTP endpoints your integration service must implement. {{< var vm.product >}} calls these endpoints to discover and synchronize resources from your external system.

::: {.callout title="API specification"}
The reference API specification is available in the ValidMind integrations repository. Contact your ValidMind representative for access.

### Required endpoints

Your integration service must expose these endpoints:

**List resources**
: Returns a paginated list of models or artifacts available in your external system.

**Get resource details**
: Returns metadata for a specific model or artifact by ID.

**Health check**
: Returns the connection status so users can test the integration.

### Authentication

{{< var vm.product >}} authenticates requests to your service using an API key passed in the request header. Your service should validate this key before returning data.

## Set up custom integrations

::: {.attn}

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] You can manage workspace settings.[^1]
- [x] Your integration service is deployed and accessible from {{< var vm.product >}}.
- [x] You have the URL and API key for your integration service.

:::

### Add a custom integration

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Integrations, select **Connections**.

3. Click **{{< fa plus >}} Add Connection**.

4. In the modal that opens, select **Custom Integration**.

5. Enter the:

   - **[integration name]{.smallcaps}** — A display name that identifies this connection.
   - **[description]{.smallcaps}** (optional) — The intended usage or additional details.
   - **[url]{.smallcaps}** — The base URL of your integration service.
   - **[api key]{.smallcaps}** — The secret that authenticates requests to your service.
   - **[type]{.smallcaps}** — Select `Model` or `Artifact` based on the resource type your integration provides.
   - **[initial status]{.smallcaps}** — Set to `Operational` to enable immediately or `Disabled` if you plan to finish setup later.

6. Click **Save Integration**.

7. Test the connection to verify your service is reachable:

   a. Hover over the custom integration you created.
   
   b. When the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** menu appears, click it and select **{{< fa circle-check >}} Test Connection**.
   
   If the test succeeds, the message **{{< fa check-circle >}} Connection successful** displays.

### Link resources

After configuring your custom integration, link resources to models in the inventory:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Select a model by clicking on it.

3. In the right sidebar, locate your custom integration connection.

4. Hover over the connection.

5. When the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** menu appears, click it and select **{{< fa link >}} Link Model**.

6. In the modal that opens, select the resource from your external system.

7. Click **Link Model**.

## Best practices

**Secure your service**
: Deploy your integration service behind HTTPS. Validate the API key on every request.

**Handle errors gracefully**
: Return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages so users can troubleshoot connection issues.

**Paginate large responses**
: If your external system contains many models or artifacts, implement pagination to keep responses fast.

**Monitor availability**
: Track the health of your integration service. {{< var vm.product >}} displays connection status in the UI, so users notice outages quickly.

**Version your API**
: Include version information in your API to support future changes without breaking existing integrations.
