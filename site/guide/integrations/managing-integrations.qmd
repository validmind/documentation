Integrations connect the {{< var validmind.platform >}} with external systems or services, enabling bidirectional data synchronization, workflow automation, and API access.

## What can I do with integrations?

<!-- The {{< var validmind.platform >}} supports various ways to integrate with external systems and services to make changes in one system visible in the other, keeping information synchronized: -->

### Analytics and reporting

Access built-in analytics and dashboards. Or, import analytics data into external reporting tools to build unified reports that combine {{< var vm.product >}} insights with other sources.[^1]

::: {.w-33-ns}
<!-- - Looker -->

::: {.w-33-ns}
<!-- - Snowflake -->
:::

### Model inventory

Link to models in external registries and development platforms and keep inventories synced with versions, inventory fields, and other metadata.[^2]

**Supported**

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-33-ns}
- AWS SageMaker
<!-- - Databricks -->

### Workflows

::: {.column-margin}
![Workflow integration example](simple-integrations-workflow.png){width=80% fig-alt="A workflow showing an automation sequence. A green start node runs an HTTP request that sends a POST to https://some.example.com/request. The workflow then moves to a webhook step that pauses until a webhook call is received. Once the webhook arrives, the flow continues to a red end node." .screenshot}
:::

Manage model lifecycles by configuring workflows to transition models through your organization’s custom model stages.[^3]

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-50 .pr5}
**From {{< var vm.product >}}**  
Send HTTP requests to external services when a model reaches a specific state or to trigger updates in other systems.
:::

::: {.w-50 .pl3 .pr3}
**From external systems**  
Send webhooks (POST requests) into {{< var vm.product >}} to start workflows or to resume workflows that are paused and waiting for input.
:::

::::

### Public REST API

Gain programmatic access to platform resources. The API supports integration with custom scripts, automation tools, and external platforms that need direct access to {{< var vm.product >}}.[^4]

**CRUD examples**

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-33-ns}
- Create models
:::

::: {.w-33-ns}
- Get artifacts (findings)
:::

::: {.w-33-ns}
- Manage model inventory
:::

::::

### Testing & documentation

Integrate the {{< var validmind.developer >}} with other development platforms to run tests and test suites, generate documentation, and support ongoing monitoring. See the results locally or upload them to the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.[^5]

**Supported**

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-33-ns}
- MLflow
:::

::: {.w-33-ns}
- AWS SageMaker
:::

::: {.w-33-ns}
&nbsp;

### Service integrations

Link to tickets in external systems and keep them synchronized. Attach tickets to {{< var vm.product >}} artifacts, such as validation issues, to support coordinated tracking across your validation workflow and external project or issue management tools.

**Supported**

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-33-ns}
