Integrations connect ValidMind with the external tools your teams rely on so data, workflows, and reporting stay aligned without manual handoffs.

- Streamline data exchange between ValidMind and cloud platforms to keep datasets current.
- Trigger downstream actions in project tracking or service desk tools when model events occur.
- Sync risk and compliance evidence across systems to maintain a single source of truth.
- Embed ValidMind insights inside partner applications so stakeholders can act where they already work.
- Standardize authentication and permissions to manage access consistently across environments.

### Key concepts

- **Integration** — The part of ValidMind designed to exchange data or actions with another system, such as REST APIs or webhooks.
- **Connector** — A packaged adapter that knows how to authenticate, map data, and orchestrate workflows with a specific third-party platform.
- **Authentication flow** — The sequence of credentials, tokens, or approvals required for two systems to trust and communicate with each other.
- **Event subscription** — A configuration that tells ValidMind or a partner platform which events to publish so the other side can react in real time.
- **Data mapping** — The translation layer that aligns fields, taxonomies, and governance requirements between ValidMind and the integrated tool.
