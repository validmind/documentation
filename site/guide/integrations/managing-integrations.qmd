Integrations connect the {{< var validmind.platform >}} with external systems or services, enabling bidirectional data synchronization, workflow automation, and API access.

## What can I do with integrations?

### Analytics and reporting

Access built-in analytics and dashboards. Or, import analytics data into external reporting tools to build unified reports that combine {{< var vm.product >}} insights with other sources.

Supports: 

- Microsoft Power BI
- Looker ([coming soon]{.smallcaps})
- Snowflake ([coming soon]{.smallcaps})
:::

::: {.column width="50%" .pl2}
### Model inventory

Link to models in external registries and development platforms and keep inventories synced with versions, inventory fields, and other metadata.

Supports:

- AWS SageMaker
- GitLab
- MLflow
- AWS Bedrock ([coming soon]{.smallcaps})
- Databricks ([coming soon]{.smallcaps})

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%" .pr2}
### Workflows

Bidirectional flow of events: 

- {{< var vm.product >}} workflows can notify an external system through HTTP requests that a model has reached a given state or request an update.

- External systems can trigger actions inside {{< var vm.product >}} through webhooks by sending a POST request to start a workflow or resume one that is paused and waiting.
:::

::: {.column width="50%" .pl2}
### Public REST API

Gain programmatic access to platform resources. The API supports integration with custom scripts, automation tools, and external platforms that need direct access to {{< var vm.product >}}.

Perform full CRUD operations, such as:

- Creating models
- Updating validation status
- Retrieving documentation
- Managing inventory
:::

::::

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%" .pl2}
### Testing & documentation

Integrate the {{< var validmind.developer >}} with other development platforms to to run tests and test suites, generate documentation, and support ongoing monitoring. 

See the results locally or upload them to the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.

Supports:

- MLflow
- AWS SageMaker
:::

::: {.column width="50%" .pl2}
### Service integration

Link to tickets in external systems and keep them synchronized. 

Attach tickets to {{< var vm.product >}} artifacts, such as model artifacts, to support coordinated tracking across your validation workflow and external project or issue management tools.

Supports:

- ServiceNow
- Atlassian Jira
