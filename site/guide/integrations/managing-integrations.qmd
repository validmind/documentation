Integrations connect ValidMind with the external tools your teams rely on so data, workflows, and reporting stay aligned without manual handoffs.

## Use cases

With integrations, you can:

- Exchange data between ValidMind and other platforms.
- Sync data across systems to maintain a single source of truth.
- Trigger downstream actions in workflows on the {{< var vm.platform >}} when events in another system occur.
- Perform actions in another system when events occur on the {{< var vm.platform >}}.
- Standardize authentication and permissions to manage access consistently.

### Analytics

- ValidMind has built in analytics and dashboarding
- Analytics can be imported into other reporting tools
- Supported: Microsoft Power BI, Looker (coming soon), Snowflake (coming soon)

### Model inventory

- ValidMind can link to models in external systems
- Continuous data synchronization
- Supported: AWS SageMaker, GitLab, MLFlow, AWS Bedrock (coming soon), Databricks (coming soon)

### Workflow tools

- ValidMind can link to tickets in external systems
- Continuous data synchronization
- Tickets link to ValidMind Findings
- Supported: ServiceNow and Atlassian Jira

### Webhooks

- Webhooks integrate with ValidMind workflows
- Start workflows from webhooks
<!-- - Send webhooks from workflows -->
- Pause workflows and wait for webhooks to continue

### Public API

- ValidMind provides a public HTTP REST API
- CRUD operations on all ValidMind resources
- Examples: create model, set model to “in validation”

### Testing, findings, and documentation

- Python library exposes Python API
- Running tests generates documentation
- Uploading results to ValidMind
- Supports ongoing monitoring
- Supports integration with other platforms
- Supported: MLflow, SageMaker

## Key concepts

**Integration**
: The part of ValidMind designed to exchange data or actions with another system, such as REST APIs or webhooks.

**Secret**
: A credential that stores the API key, password, or token required by the external service.

**Connection**
: A packaged adapter that knows how to authenticate, map data, and orchestrate workflows with a specific third-party platform.

**HTTP request**
: A workflow step that sends data from ValidMind to another service.

**Webhook**
: A workflow step that does the opposite to an HTTP request. Another system sends a POST request to a secure ValidMind URL to start the workflow.
