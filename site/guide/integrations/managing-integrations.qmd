Integrations connect ValidMind with the external tools your teams rely on so data, workflows, and reporting stay aligned without manual handoffs.

- Streamline data exchange between ValidMind and cloud platforms to keep datasets current.
- Standardize authentication and permissions to manage access consistently across environments.
- Trigger downstream actions in project tracking or service desk tools when model events occur.
- Sync risk and compliance evidence across systems to maintain a single source of truth.
- Embed ValidMind insights inside partner applications so stakeholders can act where they already work.

### Key concepts

- **Integration** — The part of ValidMind designed to exchange data or actions with another system, such as REST APIs or webhooks.
- **Secret** — A credential that stores the API key, password, or token required by the external service.
- **Connection** — A packaged adapter that knows how to authenticate, map data, and orchestrate workflows with a specific third-party platform.
- **HTTP request** — A workflow step that sends data from ValidMind to another service.
- **Webhook** — A workflow step that does the opposite. Another system sends a POST request to a secure ValidMind URL to start the workflow.

### How workflows support integrations

With workflows, you can let ValidMind exchange information with any supported external system or service that can send or receive standard HTTP calls.

An *HTTP request* step sends data from ValidMind to another service. A workflow can notify a partner tool when a model reaches a certain state or request an update in an external system. This pattern is useful when ValidMind owns the event and needs to push it outward.

A *webhook* step does the opposite. Another system sends a POST request to a secure ValidMind URL to start the workflow. This lets external tools trigger actions inside ValidMind when an event occurs on their side.

Together these steps support event driven exchange, keep integrations flexible, and allow teams to coordinate lifecycle, compliance, and reporting activity with systems that do not yet have dedicated connectors.
