Integrations connect the {{< var validmind.platform >}} with external systems or services and keep information synchronized. 

Integrations can react to external events and trigger actions inside the {{< var vm.platform >}}. They can also send updates back to other systems when activities occur in the {{< var vm.platform >}}. This bidirectional flow reduces manual updates and helps maintain a single, reliable source of information. Standardized authentication and permissions to support predictable access control.

## Key concepts

**Integration**
: The part of ValidMind designed to exchange data or actions with another system, such as REST APIs or webhooks.

**Secret**
: A credential that stores the API key, password, or token required by the external service.

**Connection**
: A packaged adapter that knows how to authenticate, map data, and orchestrate workflows with a specific third-party platform.

**HTTP request**
: A workflow step that sends data from ValidMind to another service.

**Webhook**
: A workflow step that does the opposite to an HTTP request. Another system sends a POST request to a secure ValidMind URL to start the workflow.
