## Workflow examples

Use HTTP request steps to send data from {{< var vm.product >}} to another service, configure workflows to start when external systems send webhook POST requests, or add webhook step triggers that pause workflow execution until an external system sends a POST request.

### Add HTTP request steps

HTTP request steps send data from {{< var vm.product >}} to an external service. Use them to notify partner tools when a model reaches a certain state or request updates in external systems.

1. Open the workflow you want to modify.

2. From the **Workflow Steps** modal, drag and drop an **HTTP Request** step onto the canvas.

3. Double-click the step to open the **Configure HTTP Request** modal.

4. Configure the request:

   - **URL** — Enter the endpoint URL where the external service expects to receive data, such as `https://example.com/webhook`.
   - **Method** — Select the HTTP method from the dropdown (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
   - **Timeout (seconds)** — Set how long to wait for a response before timing out. Maximum is 300 seconds, or set to 0 to disable timeout.
   - **Headers** — Click **+ Add header** to include custom HTTP headers required by the external service, such as `Content-Type` or `Authorization`.
   - **Fail on non-2xx** — When enabled, the request is considered failed if the response status code is not in the 2xx range (e.g., 404, 500).
   - **Allow invalid certificates** — When enabled, the request can proceed even if SSL certificates are invalid.
   - **Follow redirects** — When enabled, the request automatically follows HTTP redirects.
   - **Require HTTPS** — When enabled, only HTTPS URLs are allowed.

5. Click **Update Step** to save your configuration.

The HTTP request step executes when the workflow reaches this step, sending the configured request to the external service.

### Start workflows via webhook

Configure workflows to start automatically when an external system sends a POST request to a {{< var vm.product >}} webhook URL. This lets external tools trigger actions inside {{< var vm.product >}} when events occur on their side.

1. Open the workflow you want to configure, or [create a new workflow](/guide/workflows/configure-workflows.qmd#add-new-workflows).

2. In the workflow configuration, locate the **[workflow start]{.smallcaps}** section.

3. Select **Via Webhook**.

   The workflow description updates to indicate that the workflow starts when a webhook event is received.

4. Save your workflow configuration.

After saving, {{< var vm.product >}} generates a unique webhook URL for this workflow. External systems can send POST requests to this URL to trigger the workflow.

The example could be curls, like this for running a workflow from the start:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.dev.vm.validmind.ai/vm/api/v1/webhooks/cmi6nu5mi000d0f67u3mif3xd/naUM -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'x-api-key: 9d412fc2863c35bc51fa2b4e869930e6' -H 'x-api-secret: 7799d7d8f9b0cb646c7d37a57b6612ecf509f3c0b020f8bda83273e9c920fa5e' --data '{
  "action": "run_workflow",
  "target": "cmglcb4v100e70np28h3s6ph1",
  "entity_name": "InventoryModel"
}'

## Add webhook step triggers

Webhook step triggers pause workflow execution and wait for an external system to send a POST request to a {{< var vm.product >}} webhook URL. Use them when you need to pause a workflow until an external system performs an action or provides data.

1. Open the workflow you want to modify.

2. From the **Workflow Steps** modal, drag and drop a **Webhook** step onto the canvas.

3. Double-click the step to open the **Webhook Step Trigger** modal.

4. Review the webhook configuration:

   - **URL** — {{< var vm.product >}} generates a unique webhook URL for this step. Copy this URL to configure your external system to send POST requests here.
   - **Select target model for payload** — Choose the model that should be associated with the webhook payload, or leave as "No model selected" if not applicable.
   - **Payload** — The JSON structure that external systems must send in their POST request:
     ```json
     {
       "action": "run_step",
       "target": "<target_cuid>",
       "entity_name": "InventoryModel"
     }
     ```
   - **Authentication headers** — External systems must include these headers in their POST request:
     - `x-api-key` — Your API key
     - `x-api-secret` — Your API secret
   - **Wait for webhook trigger when reached** — When enabled, the workflow pauses execution when it reaches this step and waits for the external system to send the POST request.

5. Click **Update Step** to save your configuration.

When the workflow reaches this step, it pauses and waits for the external system to send a POST request to the webhook URL. Once the request is received and validated, the workflow continues to the next step.

And this one to continue a workflow from the paused workflow step, which "pause workflow and wait for webhook to continue" refers to:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.dev.vm.validmind.ai/vm/api/v1/webhooks/cmi6nu5mi000d0f67u3mif3xd/HcPW -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'x-api-key: 9d412fc2863c35bc51fa2b4e869930e6' -H 'x-api-secret: 7799d7d8f9b0cb646c7d37a57b6612ecf509f3c0b020f8bda83273e9c920fa5e' --data '{
  "action": "run_step",
  "target": "cmglcb4v100e70np28h3s6ph1",
  "entity_name": "InventoryModel"
}'
```
