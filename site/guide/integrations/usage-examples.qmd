## Workflow examples

### Create a Jira ticket

To create a Jira ticket when model validation requires attention:

::: {.column-margin}
![Create a Jira issue](usage-examples-http-request-open-jira-ticket.png){width=80% fig-alt="Screenshot of the HTTP request step configured to create a Jira ticket, showing the required fields described in step 4." .screenshot}
:::

1. Under **Settings** > **Workflows**, open the workflow you want to modify.

2. From the **Workflow Steps** modal, drag and drop an **HTTP Request** step onto the canvas, then connect it your workflow.

3. Double-click the step to open the **Configure HTTP Request** modal.

4. Configure the required fields, replacing the placeholder values with your own:

   - **URL** — `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue`
   - **Method** — POST
   - **Headers** — Add:
     - `Content-Type: application/json`
     - `Authorization: Bearer {{Jira Personal Access Token}}`
   - **Body Type** — JSON
   - **Body** — Use the following JSON payload:
   
   ```json
   {
     "fields": {
       "project": {
         "key": "MODEL"
       },
       "summary": "Model validation failed: {{Model Name}}",
       "description": "The model [{{Model Name}}|{{Model URL}}] failed validation. Review findings in ValidMind.",
       "issuetype": {
         "name": "Bug"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. Click **Update Step** to save your configuration.

The HTTP request to create the Jira ticket gets sent when the workflow executes the step.

### Create a ServiceNow incident

To create a ServiceNow incident when a data drift issue is detected during ongoing monitoring:

1. Under **Settings** > **Workflows**, open the workflow you want to modify.

2. From the **Workflow Steps** modal, drag and drop an **HTTP Request** step onto the canvas, then connect it your workflow.

3. Double-click the step to open the **Configure HTTP Request** modal.

4. Configure the required fields, replacing the placeholder values with your own:

::: {.column-margin}
![Create a ServiceNow incident](usage-examples-http-request-open-servicenow-incident.png){width=80% fig-alt="Screenshot of the HTTP request step configured to create a ServiceNow incident, showing the required fields described in step 4." .screenshot}
:::

   - **URL** — `https://yourinstance.service-now.com/api/now/table/incident`
   - **Method** — POST
   - **Headers** — Add:
     - `Content-Type: application/json`
     - `Authorization: Basic {{ServiceNow Credentials}}`
   - **Body Type** — JSON
   - **Body** — Use the following JSON payload:

   ```json
   {
     "short_description": "Data drift issue detected: {{Model Name}}",
     "description": "A potential issue has been identified for model {{Model Name}} (link: [{{Model URL}}]({{Model URL}})). Please review the ongoing monitoring documentation in ValidMind.",
     "urgency": "2",
     "category": "Model Risk"
   }
   ```

The HTTP request to create the ServiceNow incident gets sent when the workflow executes the step.

### Start workflows via webhook

To start a {{< var vm.product >}} workflow from an external system:

#### On the {{< var validmind.platform >}}

1. Add a new workflow, selecting the **Via Webhook** workflow start option.[^5]

2. From the **Workflow Steps** modal, drag and drop a **Webhook** step onto the canvas, then connect it your workflow.

3. Double-click the step to open the **Webhook Step Trigger** modal.

4. Configure the webhook details:

   - **URL** — The unique webhook URL to use when configuring your external system to send POST requests.
   - **Select target model for payload** — The model that should be associated with the webhook payload, or leave as `No model selected` if not applicable.
   - **Payload** — The JSON payload that external systems must send in their POST request, where `target_cuid` is the CUID of the target model:
   
     ```json
     {
       "action": "run_workflow",
       "target": "<target_cuid>",
       "entity_name": "InventoryModel"
     }
     ```

   - **Authentication headers** — External systems must include these headers in their POST request:
     - `x-api-key` — Your API key
     - `x-api-secret` — Your API secret
   - **Wait for webhook trigger when reached** — When enabled, the workflow pauses execution when it reaches this step and waits for the external system to send the POST request.

5. Click **Save Workflow**.

#### From the external system

Send a POST request to the webhook URL with a JSON payload that includes the `run_workflow` action:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.dev.vm.validmind.ai/vm/api/v1/webhooks/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/xxxx -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'x-api-key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' -H 'x-api-secret: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' --data '{
  "action": "run_workflow",
  "target": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "entity_name": "InventoryModel"
}'
```

### Add webhook step triggers

To trigger a waiting {{< var vm.product >}} workflow step to continue from an external system:

#### On the {{< var validmind.platform >}}

1. Open the workflow you want to configure, or add a new workflow.[^5]

2. From the **Workflow Steps** modal, drag and drop a **Webhook** step onto the canvas, then connect it your workflow.

3. Double-click the step to open the **Webhook Step Trigger** modal.

4. Review and update the webhook details:

   - **URL** — The unique webhook URL to use when configuring your external system to send POST requests.
   - **Select target model for payload** — The model that should be associated with the webhook payload, or leave as `No model selected` if not applicable.
   - **Payload** — The JSON payload that external systems must send in their POST request, where `target_cuid` is the CUID of the target model:

     ```json
     {
       "action": "run_step",
       "target": "<target_cuid>",
       "entity_name": "InventoryModel"
     }
     ```

   - **Authentication headers** — External systems must include these headers in their POST request:
     - `x-api-key` — Your API key
     - `x-api-secret` — Your API secret
   - **Wait for webhook trigger when reached** — When enabled, the workflow pauses execution when it reaches this step and waits for the external system to send the POST request.

5. Click **Update Step** to save your configuration.

When the workflow reaches this step, it pauses and waits for the external system.

#### From the external system

To continue the workflow, send a POST request to the webhook URL with a JSON payload containing the `run_step` action and the `target_cuid`:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.dev.vm.validmind.ai/vm/api/v1/webhooks/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/xxxx  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'x-api-key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' -H 'x-api-secret: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' --data '{
  "action": "run_step",
  "target": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "entity_name": "InventoryModel"
}'
```
