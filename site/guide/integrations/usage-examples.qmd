## Workflow examples

### Create a Jira issue

Use a HTTP request step to to create a Jira ticket when a model validation fails or requires attention:

![Create a Jira issue](usage-examples-http-request-open-jira-ticket.png){width=80% fig-alt="Screenshot of the HTTP request step configured to create a Jira ticket, showing the required fields described in step 4." .screenshot}
:::

1. Under **Settings** > **Workflows**, open the workflow you want to modify.

2. From the **Workflow Steps** modal, drag and drop a **HTTP Request** step onto the canvas.

3. Double-click the step to open the **Configure HTTP Request** modal.

4. Configure the required fields, replacing `{{Jira Personal Access Token}}` with your own token:

   - **URL** — `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue`
   - **Method** — POST
   - **Headers** — Add the following headers:
     - `Content-Type: application/json`
     - `Authorization: Bearer {{Jira Personal Access Token}}`
   - **Body Type** — JSON
   - **Body** — Use the following JSON structure:
   
   ```json
   {
     "fields": {
       "project": {
         "key": "MODEL"
       },
       "summary": "Model validation failed: {{Model Name}}",
       "description": "The model [{{Model Name}}|{{Model URL}}] failed validation. Review findings in ValidMind.",
       "issuetype": {
         "name": "Bug"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. Click **Update Step** to save your configuration.

This HTTP request step executes when the workflow reaches this step, sending the request to create a Jira ticket to the request endpoint.

### Create a ServiceNow incident

Use a HTTP request step to create a ServiceNow incident when a data drift issue is detected over time:

1. Under **Settings** > **Workflows**, open the workflow you want to modify.

2. From the **Workflow Steps** modal, drag and drop a **HTTP Request** step onto the canvas.

3. Double-click the step to open the **Configure HTTP Request** modal.

4. Configure the required fields,, replacing `{{ServiceNow Credentials}}` with your own credentials:

::: {.column-margin}
![Create a ServiceNow incident](usage-examples-http-request-open-servicenow-incident.png){width=80% fig-alt="Screenshot of the HTTP request step configured to create a ServiceNow incident, showing the required fields described in step 4." .screenshot}
:::

   - **URL** — `https://yourinstance.service-now.com/api/now/table/incident`
   - **Method** — POST
   - **Headers** — Add the following headers:
     - `Content-Type: application/json`
     - `Authorization: Basic {{ServiceNow Credentials}}`
   - **Body Type** — JSON
   - **Body** — Use the following JSON structure:

   ```json
   {
     "short_description": "Data drift issue detected: {{Model Name}}",
     "description": "A potential issue has been identified for model {{Model Name}} (link: [{{Model URL}}]({{Model URL}})). Please review the ongoing monitoring documentation in ValidMind.",
     "urgency": "2",
     "category": "Model Risk"
   }
   ```

This HTTP request step executes when the workflow reaches this step, sending the request to create a ServiceNow incident to the request endpoint.

### Start workflows via webhook

Start a {{< var vm.product >}} workflow with `run_workflow` when an external system sends a POST request to a webhook URL. This example lets external tools trigger an action inside {{< var vm.product >}} when an event occurs on their side.

1. Add a new workflow, selecting the **Via Webhook** workflow start option.[^5]

2. From the **Workflow Steps** modal, drag and drop a **Webhook** step onto the canvas.

3. Double-click the step to open the **Webhook Step Trigger** modal.

4. Review the webhook configuration:

   - **URL** — {{< var vm.product >}} generates a unique webhook URL for this step. Copy this URL to configure your external system to send POST requests here.
   - **Select target model for payload** — Choose the model that should be associated with the webhook payload, or leave as "No model selected" if not applicable.
   - **Payload** — The JSON structure that external systems must send in their POST request:
     ```json
     {
       "action": "run_step",
       "target": "<target_cuid>",
       "entity_name": "InventoryModel"
     }
     ```
   - **Authentication headers** — External systems must include these headers in their POST request:
     - `x-api-key` — Your API key
     - `x-api-secret` — Your API secret
   - **Wait for webhook trigger when reached** — When enabled, the workflow pauses execution when it reaches this step and waits for the external system to send the POST request.

5. Click **Save Workflow**.

After saving, external systems can send POST requests to the webhook URL to trigger the workflow run.

To start the workflow, send a POST request to the webhook URL with the following payload:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.dev.vm.validmind.ai/vm/api/v1/webhooks/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/xxxx -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'x-api-key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' -H 'x-api-secret: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' --data '{
  "action": "run_workflow",
  "target": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "entity_name": "InventoryModel"
}'
```

### Add webhook step triggers

Webhook step triggers pause workflow execution and wait for an external system to send a POST request with `run_step` to a {{< var vm.product >}} webhook URL. Use them when you need to pause a workflow until an external system performs an action or provides data.

1. Open the workflow you want to configure, or add a new workflow.[^5]

2. From the **Workflow Steps** modal, drag and drop a **Webhook** step onto the canvas.

3. Double-click the step to open the **Webhook Step Trigger** modal.

4. Review the webhook configuration:

   - **URL** — {{< var vm.product >}} generates a unique webhook URL for this step. Copy this URL to configure your external system to send POST requests here.
   - **Select target model for payload** — Choose the model that should be associated with the webhook payload, or leave as "No model selected" if not applicable.
   - **Payload** — The JSON structure that external systems must send in their POST request:
     ```json
     {
       "action": "run_step",
       "target": "<target_cuid>",
       "entity_name": "InventoryModel"
     }
     ```
   - **Authentication headers** — External systems must include these headers in their POST request:
     - `x-api-key` — Your API key
     - `x-api-secret` — Your API secret
   - **Wait for webhook trigger when reached** — When enabled, the workflow pauses execution when it reaches this step and waits for the external system to send the POST request.

5. Click **Update Step** to save your configuration.

When the workflow reaches this step, it pauses and waits for the external system to send a POST request to the webhook URL. Once the request is received and validated, the workflow continues to the next step.

And this one to continue a workflow from the paused workflow step, which "pause workflow and wait for webhook to continue" refers to:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.dev.vm.validmind.ai/vm/api/v1/webhooks/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/xxxx  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'x-api-key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' -H 'x-api-secret: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' --data '{
  "action": "run_step",
  "target": "cmglcb4v100e70np28h3s6ph1",
  "entity_name": "InventoryModel"
}'
```
