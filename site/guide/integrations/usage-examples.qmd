## Workflow examples

### Create a Jira issue

Use a HTTP request step to to create a Jira ticket when a model validation fails or requires attention:

:::

1. Open the workflow you want to modify.

2. From the **Workflow Steps** modal, drag and drop an **HTTP Request** step onto the canvas.

3. Double-click the step to open the **Configure HTTP Request** modal.

4. Configure the required fields, replacing `{{Jira Personal Access Token}}` with your own token:

   - **URL** — `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue`
   - **Method** — POST
   - **Headers** — Add the following headers:
     - `Content-Type: application/json`
     - `Authorization: Bearer {{Jira Personal Access Token}}`
   - **Body Type** — JSON
   - **Body** — Use the following JSON structure:
   
   ```json
   {
     "fields": {
       "project": {
         "key": "MODEL"
       },
       "summary": "Model validation failed: {{Model Name}}",
       "description": "The model [{{Model Name}}|{{Model URL}}] failed validation. Review findings in ValidMind.",
       "issuetype": {
         "name": "Bug"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. Click **Update Step** to save your configuration.

This HTTP request step executes when the workflow reaches this step, sending the request to create a Jira ticket to the request endpoint.

### Create a ServiceNow incident

Create a ServiceNow incident when a data drift issue is detected over time, replacing `{{ServiceNow Credentials}}` with your own credentials:

:::


**Configuration:**

- **URL** — `https://yourinstance.service-now.com/api/now/table/incident`
- **Method** — POST
- **Headers** — Add the following headers:
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  - `Authorization: Basic {{ServiceNow Credentials}}`
- **Body Type** — JSON
- **Body** — Use the following JSON structure:

  ```json
  {
    "short_description": "Data drift issue detected: {{Model Name}}",
    "description": "A potential issue has been identified for model {{Model Name}} (link: [{{Model URL}}]({{Model URL}})). Please review the ongoing monitoring documentation in ValidMind.",
    "urgency": "2",
    "category": "Model Risk"
  }
  ```

This HTTP request step executes when the workflow reaches this step, sending the request to create a ServiceNow incident to the request endpoint.

### Start workflows via webhook

Configure workflows to start automatically when an external system sends a POST request to a {{< var vm.product >}} webhook URL. This lets external tools trigger actions inside {{< var vm.product >}} when events occur on their side.

1. Open the workflow you want to configure, or [create a new workflow](/guide/workflows/configure-workflows.qmd#add-new-workflows).

2. In the workflow configuration, locate the **[workflow start]{.smallcaps}** section.

3. Select **Via Webhook**.

   The workflow description updates to indicate that the workflow starts when a webhook event is received.

4. Save your workflow configuration.

After saving, {{< var vm.product >}} generates a unique webhook URL for this workflow. External systems can send POST requests to this URL to trigger the workflow.

The example could be curls, like this for running a workflow from the start:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.dev.vm.validmind.ai/vm/api/v1/webhooks/cmi6nu5mi000d0f67u3mif3xd/naUM -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'x-api-key: 9d412fc2863c35bc51fa2b4e869930e6' -H 'x-api-secret: 7799d7d8f9b0cb646c7d37a57b6612ecf509f3c0b020f8bda83273e9c920fa5e' --data '{
  "action": "run_workflow",
  "target": "cmglcb4v100e70np28h3s6ph1",
  "entity_name": "InventoryModel"
}'

## Add webhook step triggers

Webhook step triggers pause workflow execution and wait for an external system to send a POST request to a {{< var vm.product >}} webhook URL. Use them when you need to pause a workflow until an external system performs an action or provides data.

1. Open the workflow you want to modify.

2. From the **Workflow Steps** modal, drag and drop a **Webhook** step onto the canvas.

3. Double-click the step to open the **Webhook Step Trigger** modal.

4. Review the webhook configuration:

   - **URL** — {{< var vm.product >}} generates a unique webhook URL for this step. Copy this URL to configure your external system to send POST requests here.
   - **Select target model for payload** — Choose the model that should be associated with the webhook payload, or leave as "No model selected" if not applicable.
   - **Payload** — The JSON structure that external systems must send in their POST request:
     ```json
     {
       "action": "run_step",
       "target": "<target_cuid>",
       "entity_name": "InventoryModel"
     }
     ```
   - **Authentication headers** — External systems must include these headers in their POST request:
     - `x-api-key` — Your API key
     - `x-api-secret` — Your API secret
   - **Wait for webhook trigger when reached** — When enabled, the workflow pauses execution when it reaches this step and waits for the external system to send the POST request.

5. Click **Update Step** to save your configuration.

When the workflow reaches this step, it pauses and waits for the external system to send a POST request to the webhook URL. Once the request is received and validated, the workflow continues to the next step.

And this one to continue a workflow from the paused workflow step, which "pause workflow and wait for webhook to continue" refers to:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.dev.vm.validmind.ai/vm/api/v1/webhooks/cmi6nu5mi000d0f67u3mif3xd/HcPW -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'x-api-key: 9d412fc2863c35bc51fa2b4e869930e6' -H 'x-api-secret: 7799d7d8f9b0cb646c7d37a57b6612ecf509f3c0b020f8bda83273e9c920fa5e' --data '{
  "action": "run_step",
  "target": "cmglcb4v100e70np28h3s6ph1",
  "entity_name": "InventoryModel"
}'
```
