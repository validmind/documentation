Integrations connect ValidMind with the external tools your teams rely on so data, workflows, and reporting stay aligned without manual handoffs.

- Streamline data exchange between ValidMind and cloud platforms to keep datasets current.
- Trigger downstream actions in project tracking or service desk tools when model events occur.
- Sync risk and compliance evidence across systems to maintain a single source of truth.
- Embed ValidMind insights inside partner applications so stakeholders can act where they already work.
- Standardize authentication and permissions to manage access consistently across environments.

### Key concepts

- **Integration surface** — The part of ValidMind designed to exchange data or actions with another system, such as REST APIs or webhooks.
- **Connector** — A packaged adapter that knows how to authenticate, map data, and orchestrate workflows with a specific third-party platform.
- **Authentication flow** — The sequence of credentials, tokens, or approvals required for two systems to trust and communicate with each other.
- **Event subscription** — A configuration that tells ValidMind or a partner platform which events to publish so the other side can react in real time.
- **Data mapping** — The translation layer that aligns fields, taxonomies, and governance requirements between ValidMind and the integrated tool.

## Integration focus areas

ValidMind’s integration roadmap concentrates on the core workflows where model governance teams already collaborate with adjacent platforms:

- **Inventory sync** — Keep model registries aligned with GitLab, MLflow, AWS SageMaker, and Jira so updates in one system reflect across the portfolio.
- **Collaboration** — Surface model tasks inside ServiceNow and Jira to streamline issue tracking, approvals, and operational handoffs.
- **Analytics** — Push curated datasets and metrics into Snowflake or Power BI so stakeholders can analyze performance alongside enterprise BI sources.
- **Library** — Reuse assets from MLflow and SAS libraries inside ValidMind to accelerate documentation, validation, and testing.

## MVP experience requirements

Initial releases of the integrations experience should deliver:

- Integration settings pages with secret management and lifecycle controls.
- ValidMind Marketplace pages that introduce each connector and guide installation.
- Webhook orchestration, including send-webhook nodes, wait-for-webhook pauses, jump behavior, and start-in-the-middle support.
- Workflow triggers that start executions from inbound webhooks and allow calculated fields to reference integration-sourced values.
- Model and finding overviews that display linked external systems, with bidirectional updates when key fields change.
- Actions that create and bind external records (for example, opening Jira issues when findings are logged).
- RBAC policies governing who can configure, run, or view integrations across teams.
- Test results that reference the appropriate integration context and appear alongside findings.
- Integration field exposure inside the enterprise model inventory lists for filtering and reporting.
