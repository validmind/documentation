Connections link {{< var vm.product >}} with the external systems your teams already use for collaboration, automation, and model lifecycle tracking. Each connection knows how to authenticate, map data, and keep events flowing between platforms such as Jira, ServiceNow, AWS SageMaker, MLflow, and GitLab.

::: {.attn}

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] You can manage workspace settings.[^1]
- [x] The integration’s required secrets already exist in [Integration Secrets](manage-integration-secrets.qmd).
- [x] You coordinated with the external system owner to confirm scopes, board IDs, project IDs, or URIs needed for the connector.

:::

## Add a connection

1. In the {{< var validmind.platform >}}, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**, then go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Connections**.
2. Click **Add Connection** to open the catalog of supported services.
3. Select a service to open its configuration modal. Each modal shares common fields:
   - **Integration name** and **Description** — Label and describe the connection so other admins can identify its purpose.
   - **Status** — Leave set to `Operational` to activate immediately or switch to `Maintenance` if you plan to finish setup later.
   - **Credentials** — Choose the secret that stores the API key, password, or token required by the external service. If the selector says “No active secrets found,” create the secret first.
4. Complete the provider-specific fields described below.
5. Click **Save Integration**. The connection moves to the **Connected Services** list and becomes available to workflows, inventory sync, or issue automations depending on the provider.

::: {.callout title="Edit or pause existing connections"}
Select a connection from the list to update its credentials, change the synchronization scope, or set the status to `Paused` / `Maintenance` during troubleshooting.

## Connection field reference

:::: {.panel-tabset}

### Jira

- **Jira instance URL** — Enter the base URL for your Cloud or Server deployment, such as `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net`.
- **Personal access token** — Choose the secret that stores a Jira PAT with `read:jira-work` and `write:jira-work` scopes.
- **JQL query** (*optional*) — Limit synced issues by project, status, or labels. Leave blank to sync all tickets.

### ServiceNow

- **Instance URL** — Provide the base URL for your ServiceNow environment.
- **Authentication method** — Select `Username & Password` or another supported mechanism, then map the appropriate secrets.
- **Username / Password** — Choose secrets that store the ServiceNow credentials. Use dedicated, service-type accounts so you can rotate passwords without disrupting personal accounts.
- **ServiceNow board** — Pick the board or table that should receive linked tickets.

### Amazon SageMaker

- **AWS region** — Enter the primary region where your SageMaker model registry lives (for example `us-west-2`).
- **Access key ID** and **Secret access key** — Select secrets generated by AWS IAM with permissions to read the model registry.

### MLflow

- **Tracking URI** — Provide the tracking server endpoint, e.g. `https://mlflow.example.com`.
- **Username / Password** — Select secrets with MLflow credentials if authentication is enabled. Leave blank for anonymous access.

### GitLab

- **Project ID** — Supply the GitLab project or group path that contains the ML repository to sync.
- **GitLab instance URL** (*optional*) — Leave blank for gitlab.com or enter the self-hosted URL.
- **Personal access token** — Select a PAT secret that includes the `api` or `read_api` scope so ValidMind can read metadata and findings.

::::

## Troubleshooting

- **Integration fails to save.** Check that every required field is filled and that referenced secrets still exist. Secrets deleted from the Integration Secrets page must be recreated before resaving the connector.
- **No data appears after connecting.** Confirm the integration status is `Operational` and that filters such as JQL or board selections include the right records.
- **Authentication errors.** Rotate the secret in both systems. For OAuth-style PATs, ensure scopes include the APIs ValidMind calls.
