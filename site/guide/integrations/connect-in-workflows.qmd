Use HTTP request steps to send data from ValidMind to another service, configure workflows to start when external systems send webhook POST requests, or add webhook step triggers that pause workflow execution until an external system sends a POST request.

## How workflows support integrations

With workflows, you can let ValidMind exchange information with any supported external system or service that can send or receive standard HTTP calls.

An *HTTP request* step sends data from ValidMind to another service. A workflow can notify a partner tool when a model reaches a certain state or request an update in an external system. This pattern is useful when ValidMind owns the event and needs to push it outward.

A *webhook* step does the opposite. Another system sends a POST request to  start a ValidMind workflow or to continue a workflow that is paused while waiting for a webhook to continue. This lets external tools trigger actions inside ValidMind when an event occurs on their side.

Together these steps support event driven exchange, keep integrations flexible, and allow teams to coordinate lifecycle, compliance, and reporting activity with systems that do not yet have dedicated connectors.

## Add HTTP request steps

HTTP request steps send data from ValidMind to an external service. Use them to notify partner tools when a model reaches a certain state or request updates in external systems.

1. Open the workflow you want to modify.

2. From the **Workflow Steps** modal, drag and drop an **HTTP Request** step onto the canvas.

3. Double-click the step to open the **Configure HTTP Request** modal.

4. Configure the request:

   - **URL** — Enter the endpoint URL where the external service expects to receive data, such as `https://example.com/webhook`.
   - **Method** — Select the HTTP method from the dropdown (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
   - **Timeout (seconds)** — Set how long to wait for a response before timing out. Maximum is 300 seconds, or set to 0 to disable timeout.
   - **Headers** — Click **+ Add header** to include custom HTTP headers required by the external service, such as `Content-Type` or `Authorization`.
   - **Fail on non-2xx** — When enabled, the request is considered failed if the response status code is not in the 2xx range (e.g., 404, 500).
   - **Allow invalid certificates** — When enabled, the request can proceed even if SSL certificates are invalid.
   - **Follow redirects** — When enabled, the request automatically follows HTTP redirects.
   - **Require HTTPS** — When enabled, only HTTPS URLs are allowed.

5. Click **Update Step** to save your configuration.

The HTTP request step executes when the workflow reaches this step, sending the configured request to the external service.

## Start workflows via webhook

Configure workflows to start automatically when an external system sends a POST request to a ValidMind webhook URL. This lets external tools trigger actions inside ValidMind when events occur on their side.

1. Open the workflow you want to configure, or [create a new workflow](/guide/workflows/configure-workflows.qmd#add-new-workflows).

2. In the workflow configuration, locate the **[workflow start]{.smallcaps}** section.

3. Select **Via Webhook**.

   The workflow description updates to indicate that the workflow starts when a webhook event is received.

4. Save your workflow configuration.

After saving, ValidMind generates a unique webhook URL for this workflow. External systems can send POST requests to this URL to trigger the workflow.

## Add webhook step triggers

Webhook step triggers pause workflow execution and wait for an external system to send a POST request to a ValidMind webhook URL. Use them when you need to pause a workflow until an external system performs an action or provides data.

1. Open the workflow you want to modify.

2. From the **Workflow Steps** modal, drag and drop a **Webhook** step onto the canvas.

3. Double-click the step to open the **Webhook Step Trigger** modal.

4. Review the webhook configuration:

   - **URL** — ValidMind generates a unique webhook URL for this step. Copy this URL to configure your external system to send POST requests here.
   - **Select target model for payload** — Choose the model that should be associated with the webhook payload, or leave as "No model selected" if not applicable.
   - **Payload** — The JSON structure that external systems must send in their POST request:
     ```json
     {
       "action": "run_step",
       "target": "<target_cuid>",
       "entity_name": "InventoryModel"
     }
     ```
   - **Authentication headers** — External systems must include these headers in their POST request:
     - `x-api-key` — Your API key
     - `x-api-secret` — Your API secret
   - **Wait for webhook trigger when reached** — When enabled, the workflow pauses execution when it reaches this step and waits for the external system to send the POST request.

5. Click **Update Step** to save your configuration.

When the workflow reaches this step, it pauses and waits for the external system to send a POST request to the webhook URL. Once the request is received and validated, the workflow continues to the next step.
