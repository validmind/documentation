Integration secrets centralize the credentials your connectors need so teams can reference encrypted tokens without pasting them into every configuration. Store each API key once, then re-use it across Jira, ServiceNow, AWS SageMaker, and other supported integrations.

::: {.attn}

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] You are assigned a role that can edit workspace settings, such as [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble}.[^1]
- [x] You collected the scoped credentials required by the external platform, for example a Jira personal access token or AWS access keys.

## Add an integration secret

1. In the {{< var validmind.platform >}}, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Integration Secrets**.
3. Click **Add Secret**.
4. Complete the form:
   - **Secret name** — Enter a human-readable label that indicates which system the secret belongs to. This label appears later in the **Personal access token** and similar fields inside connector forms.
   - **Description** (*optional*) — Summarize when to use the secret or who owns it so other admins know whether it is safe to re-use.
   - **Secret value** — Paste the credential exactly as issued by the external system. {{< var vm.product >}} encrypts the value immediately and never displays it in plaintext again.
   - **Expiration date** (*optional*) — Set a rotation reminder if the external system enforces key expiry.
5. Click **Create Secret**. The secret now appears under **Organization Secrets** and becomes selectable when configuring integrations.

::: {.callout title="Rotate shared credentials"}
Create a new secret before an old token expires. Update each integration to reference the new secret, then delete the retired one to prevent accidental reuse.
:::

## Edit an existing secret

1. Return to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Integration Secrets** to see the list of existing credentials.
2. Click the secret you want to change—such as **My Secret** to open its details drawer and confirm its current status, creation date, and expiration date.
3. Select **Edit Secret** to reopen the form.
4. Update any metadata:
   - **Secret name** and **Description** — Adjust the label or context text so other admins know when to reuse it.
   - **Secret value** — Leave blank to keep the current encrypted credential, or paste a replacement if the external platform issued a new token.
   - **Expiration date** — Extend or shorten the rotation window.
5. Click **Update Secret** to save your changes. The secret remains active and continues to power any integrations that reference it.

## Troubleshooting

- **The connector form says “No active secrets found.”** Confirm that at least one secret exists on the **Integration Secrets** page and that it has not been deleted. Refresh the connector modal after adding the new secret.
- **The secret value fails validation.** Many platforms require minimum lengths, specific scopes, or multi-factor confirmation before issuing tokens. Regenerate the credential in the source system and paste it again.
- **A rotation breaks an integration.** Update every connection that referenced the old secret before deleting it. You can temporarily set the connection’s **Initial status** to `Maintenance` to pause automated workflows while rotating credentials.[^2]
