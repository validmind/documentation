## Release highlights

This release includes a number of major enhancements to the ValidMind Developer Framework to support additional use cases and improve the developer experience when you encounter error conditions. In addition, this release includes an updated notebook to illustrate support for NLP models with CatBoost for improved performance, along with a Word-like text editor experience when collaborating on documentation projects online.

### ValidMind Developer Framework (v1.16.0)

- **Support for Credit Risk Scorecard and Probability of Default use cases**. We've enhanced our Developer Framework to be more versatile than ever, so you can now document and validate more model use cases. To learn more about how you can use ValidMind for these specific new use case, we've provided two new interactive Jupyter notebooks for a hands-on experience. Try them:
    
    - [Credit Risk Scorecard Demo](../notebooks/probability_of_default/credit_risk_scorecard_demo.ipynb)
    - [Probability of Default Model](../notebooks/probability_of_default/probability_of_default_validmind.ipynb)

- **Updated notebook to illustrate support for NLP models using CatBoost**. Now with enhanced performance compared to the original notebook that utilized PyTorch, this notebook showcases natural language processing (NLP) data analysis and text classification using the Developer Framework with emphasis on the in-depth analysis and preprocessing of COVID-19 tweets.

- **Improved developer experience when you encounter error conditions**. Unhandled errors now return an error code with a more descriptive message that can help you with looking them up in the troubleshooting section of our documentation. We also improved error handling when tests fail to run and the test results summary widget now display error information for each test that fails to run. 
 . . . . 
### ValidMind Platform UI (v1.4.1)

- **Improved, Word-like text editor**. When collaborating on documentation projects in the Platform UI with others, you now have an improved text editor at your disposal. The look and feel should be familiar if you previously used Microsoft Word to manage model documentation and validation reports. In addition to the new editing features, you can user the editor to participate in comment threads, track changes, see the revision history, enter math formulas, and more.

<!--- TO DO screen shot --->

- Added new "add content block" feature.
    - "Add text block" feature allows adding new text boxes anywhere on model documentation pages
    - "Add test driven block" feature allows adding new content blocks to display metrics and test results collected by the developer framework
    
    Content blocks can be added in existing documentation projects simply by hovering over the line between sections. [Try it ...](add-content-blocks.qmd) 

<!--- TO DO Need Swap template docs --->

- **Swap templates for documentation projects**. This feature is designed to enhance the flexibility of documenting models. With it, you can seamlessly update an existing documentation project by either switching to an entirely different template or by simply upgrading to a more recent version of the template currently in use. This new feature ensures that your documentation projects can remain up-to-date and align with the latest preferred template without the need to start from scratch. [Try it ...](swap-documentation-project-templates.qmd)

- **UI enhancements**:
    - **Activity Widget**: We enhanced the user interface with new tabs, enabling you to filter events based on activity type.
    - **Findings page**: We made comprehensive UI upgrades for both findings and detailed findings sections.
    - **Models and Projects list** : We refined the user interface, featuring more intuitive default sorting and more user-friendly filtering.

<!-- This requires a docs update, included in this PR -->
- **Renamed Client Integration page to Getting Started. To better reflect when you use the credentials for a newly created documentation project with the ValidMind Developer Framework, we have renamed the **Client Integration** page to **Getting Started** in the Platform UI. 

## How to upgrade

To access the latest version of the [ValidMind Platform UI](http://app.prod.validmind.ai/), reload your browser tab.

To upgrade the ValidMind Developer Framework:

- [Using Jupyter Hub](try-developer-framework-with-jupyterhub.qmd): reload your browser tab and re-run the `!pip install --upgrade validmind` cell.

- [Using Docker](try-developer-framework-with-docker.qmd): pull the latest Docker image:
    
    ```jsx
    docker pull validmind/validmind-jupyter-demo:latest
    
    ```
    
- [In your own developer environment](install-and-initialize-developer-framework.qmd): restart your notebook and re-run:
    
    ```python
    !pip install validmind
    ```
