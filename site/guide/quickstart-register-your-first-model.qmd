To be able to document models with the ValidMind Platform, you need to register them in the model inventory first. Let's show you how. 

## Steps

1. [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_ui >}}).

2. In the left sidebar, navigate to **Model Inventory** and click **+ Register new model**.

   To register a model for use with the QuickStart notebook, select:
   
   - Documentation template: `Binary classification`
   - Use case: `Attrition/Churn Management`

   You can fill in other options according to your own preference. 

3. Click **Continue**.

   After the model is registered, you get initial model documentation and a validation report based on the documentation template.

Continue with [Generate documentation for your model](quickstart-generate-documentation-for-your-model.qmd) to learn how to use the QuickStart notebook you looked at earlier with your first model.
