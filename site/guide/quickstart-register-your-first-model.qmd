To be able to document models, you need to register them in the model inventory first, so let's show you how. 

## Steps

1. [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_ui >}}).

2. In the left sidebar, navigate to **Model Inventory** and click **+ Register new model**.

   To register a model for use with the QuickStart notebook, select:
   
   - Documentation template: `Binary classification`
   - Use case: `Attrition/Churn Management`

   ![](quickstart-model-registration.png){width=60% fig-alt="The Get Started page for a model that shows the code snippet you need to copy with the Copy snippet to clipboard button"}

   You can fill in other options according to your own preference. 

3. Click **Continue**.

   After the model is registered, you get the initial model documentation and validation report based on the documentation template.

## What's next

Next, you will generate model documentation and test results with the QuickStart notebook you looked at earlier. Continue with [Generate documentation for your model](quickstart-generate-documentation-for-your-model.qmd).
