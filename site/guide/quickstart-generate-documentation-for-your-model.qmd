You are now ready to modify the QuickStart notebook to upload to your own project that you created earlier.

## Steps

4. In the left sidebar, go to **Getting Started**.

   The page that opens provides you with a _code snippet_ to use with the ValidMind Developer Framework. 

   - `api_host`: The location of the ValidMind API
   - `api_key`: The account API key
   - `api_secret`: The account secret key
   - `project`: The project identifier

   The code snippet can be copied and pasted directly into your developer source code to integrate the ValidMind Developer Framework and to be able to upload to the ValidMind Platform. 
   
   To follow best practices, you can also [store the credentials in a `.env` file](store-credentials-in-env-file.qmd) and pass them in via environment variables.

### Missing the API_SECRET?
Use the  {{< fa copy >}} **icon** to copy the `API_SECRET` to your clipboard.

1. Reopen the QuickStart notebook you accessed earlier.

2. In the QuickStart notebook, replace the `vm.init()` lines that look like the following with your own client integration information from the earlier step when you registered your new model:

3. Run each cell in the notebook:

   - Hover over each cell and click the {{< fa circle-play >}} **icon**; OR
   - Press `Shift + Enter` on Windows or `Cmd + Enter` if you are on a Mac
   
   The notebook will install the ValidMind library and then connect to the ValidMind Platform.

You can now switch back to the Platform UI and view the documentation that has been created by the data and artifacts provided by the developer framework.
