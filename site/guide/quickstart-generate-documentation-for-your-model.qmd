You are now ready to modify the QuickStart notebook you used earlier and run it to generate model documentation and test result with the ValidMind Developer Framework. The resulting artifacts are then uploaded to your model documentation in the ValidMind Platform UI. 

## Steps

1. In the left sidebar, go to the **Getting Started** section of the model [you registered previously](quickstart-register-your-first-model.qmd):

   ![](quickstart-getting-started.png){width=90% fig-align="left" fig-alt="The QuickStart notebook in Colab with the section showing that you need to replace"}

   The page that opens provides you with a _code snippet_ to use with the ValidMind Developer Framework, including: 

   - `api_host`: The location of the ValidMind API
   - `api_key`: The account API key
   - `api_secret`: The account secret key
   - `project`: The project identifier

   This code snippet can be copied and pasted directly into your developer source code to integrate the ValidMind Developer Framework and to be able to upload to the ValidMind Platform. 
   
   To follow best practices, you can also [store the credentials in a `.env` file](store-credentials-in-env-file.qmd) and pass them in via environment variables.

2. Locate the code snippet and click **{{< fa regular copy >}} Copy snippet to clipboard**.

   ### Missing the API_SECRET?
   Use the **{{< fa regular copy >}} Copy snippet to clipboard** button to copy the `API_SECRET` to your clipboard.

3. Reopen the QuickStart notebook you accessed earlier ([in Jupyter Hub](quickstart-try-developer-framework-with-jupyterhub.qmd), for example).

4. In the QuickStart notebook, replace the `vm.init()` lines that look like the following with your own client integration information from the earlier step when you registered your new model:

   ![](jupyterhub-secrets.png){width=60% fig-align="left" fig-alt="The QuickStart notebook in Colab with the section showing that you need to replace"}

3. Run each cell in the notebook:

   - Hover over each cell and click the {{< fa circle-play >}} **icon**; OR
   - Press `Shift + Enter` on Windows or `Cmd + Enter` if you are on a Mac
   
   The notebook will install the ValidMind library and then connect to the ValidMind Platform.


## What's next

You can now [switch back to the Platform UI]({{< var vm_ui >}}) to view the documentation that has been generated by the developer framework.
