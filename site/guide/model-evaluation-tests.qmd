This article provides an examples of how to run model evaluation test plans, and provides a reference to other model evaluation tests and test plans available in the Developer Framework. 

## Prerequisites:

* The model is already [registered in the model inventory](register-models.qmd)
* There is an active documentation project for the model
* You have already located the project identifier, API key and secret
* You have already installed the ValidMind client library in your developer environment
* You are logged into the ValidMind Platform
