| **Introduction - Customer Churn Model Documentation (Data and Model)**<br>A more advanced version of the customer churn model, learn how to log information about a dataset, model, and training, and run tests. | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10uImCqleKr72z_FhfPmyvfpD6tF-jEvy?usp=share_link) |
| **Time Series Forecasting Model Tutorial**<br>Dive deeper into ValidMind's features by learning how you can automatically document and test a time series forecasting model. | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QVhVcZUCuk-tD_IQFiNHFPxr47dGKBR4) |
| **Sensitivity Analysis: Natural Language Processing Analysis & Binary Classification using CatBoost**<br>NLP data analysis and binary classification using CatBoost on COVID-19 tweets. The emphasis is on the in-depth analysis and preprocessing of the text data (tweets). | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BVXDKsneTwHTqezt0IXvQMoWv6ps_4cm) |
<!--- | **Credit Risk Scorecard Demo**<br>A credit risk scorecard model is a quantitative instrument designed to evaluate the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on their credit obligations based data from various sources, such as past financial transactions, credit history, and other relevant factors. | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BX1t1xmL-zrIUhVQhvm08iH1G_J8zcrW) |
| **Probability of Default Model**<br>A probability of default (PD) model is a statistical tool to estimate the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan within a specific timeframe. By analyzing a range of factors, such as credit history, income levels, and economic conditions, the model provides a quantitative measure, usually expressed as a percentage, representing the risk of default. | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1B_-WxEgJqwOixM_26c0l7XGdhnu4uset) |--->

Google Colaboratory (Colab) is a free Jupyter notebook environment that runs in the cloud. There, you can work with our Jupyter notebooks by saving your own copy, write and execute code, share your work to collaborate with others in real-time, and download notebooks to try them out locally in your own developer environment.
