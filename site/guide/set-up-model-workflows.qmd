Workflows can be configured to match your organizational needs for overseeing model development, validation, or implementation activities.

Default workflows are provided for you as suggestions. You can customize the following default workflows:

- **Model documentation:** When documentation is created
- **Inventory model:** When the model is created

<!-- 
- Model validation workflow is in missing as of May 2024
- These default workflows will eventually be replaced by a trigger you can define
 -->

 Setting up your workflow involves two major steps:

 1. [Configuring workflow steps](#configure-workflow-steps) 
 2. [Linking the workflow together](#link-workflow-together)


 <!-- The following is no longer true as of May 31, 2024: -->

<!-- ::: {.callout-warning title="Adjustments to workflows are not retroactive."}
When a workflow is edited, the new flow will only apply to new models created after the adjustment. 
::: -->

## Prerequisites

- To customize workflows, you must hold the `Customer Admin` or `Developer` role
- [Resource statuses](customize-resource-statuses.qmd) must be fully configured

## Configure workflow steps

To add or edit workflow steps:

1. [Log in to the {{< var vm_platform >}}]({{< var vm_url >}}).

2. In the left sidebar, click [**{{< fa gear >}} Settings**]({{< var vm_url >}}/settings).

3. Under Workplace Settings, select **{{< fa arrow-right-arrow-left >}} Workflows**.

4. Under available workflows, select the process you'd like to add or edit the steps for:
 
    - To add a step, drag and drop a new step onto the canvas. Hover over the step until the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** menu appears, then click on it and select **{{< fa gear >}} Configure**.
    - To edit a step, hover over the step until the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** menu appears. Then click on it and select **{{< fa gear >}} Configure**.

5. After you're finished with step configuration, click **Save** to apply your changes before closing the configuration panel with **{{< fa x >}}**.

    After you've configured a step, you can then [link your workflow together](#link-workflow-together).

Refer to **[Available step types](#available-step-types)** for information on available step types and details on how to set up conditional requirements.

### Available step types

#### Status Change

- Transitions a status. 
- Requires [available resource statuses](customize-resource-statuses.qmd) associated with the workflow.

| Field | Description |
|---:|---|
| When these conditions are met (optional) | [Add conditional requirements](#add-conditional-requirements) to qualify for this step.  |
| Set status to (required) | Select the status to transition to. |
: Status Change step configuration {.hover tbl-colwidths="[40,60]"}

#### User Action
- Creates a button that performs an action on behalf of the user. 
- Requires [available resource statuses](customize-resource-statuses.qmd) associated with the workflow.

| Field | Description |
|---:|---|
| Display action button when (optional) | [Add conditional requirements](#add-conditional-requirements) for displaying this step.  |
| Action button label (required) | Text that displays on your action button. |
| Request fields (optional) | Include [custom fields](manage-inventory-custom-fields.qmd) alongside your action if desired. Select the field, then click **+ Add Field** to insert.  |

::: {.callout-tip title="Example" appearance="minimal"}
A `Put On Hold` action that requests a value in the Date On Hold field, and transitions the resource status to On Hold.

#### Approval
- When your resource reaches the approval step, users in the selected Approval Group will receive your configured message. 
- Requires a User type [custom field](manage-inventory-custom-fields.qmd) to select from, and must be connected to both an approval and rejection **[Status Change](#status-change)** step.

::: callout 
Please note that users must be assigned to the Approval Group custom field before it is transitioned into the **Approval** workflow step in order for the message to be displayed to them. 
:::

| Field | Description |
|---:|---|
| Approval group (required) | Select the User type custom field that indicates users responsible for approval. |
| Threshold (required) | Percentage of approvers required for the resource to be approved. |
| Approval Message (required) | When your resource reaches this approval step, the users in the selected group will recieve the following message. |
: Approval Group step configuration {.hover tbl-colwidths="[35,65]"}

### Add conditional requirements

Conditional requirements can be configured for all three available step types:

| Step type | Conditional options |
|---:|---|
| Status Change | Under `When these conditions are met`, you are able to set both `AND` and `OR` conditions. |
| User Action | Under `Display action button when`, you are able to set both `AND` and `OR` conditions.  |
| Approval | Under `Threshold`, you are able to set the minimum percentage of approvers required for the resource to be approved. |
: Step type conditional options {.hover tbl-colwidths="[20,80]"}

For [Status Change](#status-change) and [User Action](#user-action) conditions, you're able to add a single independent **Rule** or a linked condition **Group**. These rules and groups can be nested if desired:

- Click **+ Rule** to add an independent rule.
- Click **+ Group** to add a linked group of rules that all must be true to qualify. 


## Link workflow together

To initiate the beginning of your workflow:

1. Locate the **Start** of your workflow.

2. Drag from the period (**.**) at the bottom of **Start** to the top **{{< fa circle >}}** on the first step of your workflow.

### Link steps together

To link subsequent steps together:

1. Click **{{< fa circle >}}** above or below the earlier step and drag it to connect to the top **{{< fa circle >}}** on the subsequent step.

    You're also able to link several different steps together at various points in the workflow, including stages that may circle back to previous steps: 

    ![](linked-workflow.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing an example of multiple steps linked together at various points in the default Inventory Model workflow."}

6. When you are finished, click **Save workflow** to apply your changes.

#### Link Approval steps
[Approval](#approval) steps need to be subsequently linked to both a Rejected and an Approval [Status Change](#status-change) step:

1. First, [configure an **Approval** step](#configure-workflow-steps).

2. Then, drag two **Status Change** steps onto the canvas:

    - Assign a `Rejected` status to one in the Set Document Status field.
    - Assign an `Approved` status to the other in the Set Document Status field.

3. Connect the **Approval** step to the `Rejected` and `Approved` **Status Change** steps with the red and green **{{< fa circle >}}** respectively by dragging from the colored **{{< fa circle >}}** to the top **{{< fa circle >}}** of the subsequent step.

![](approved-rejected.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing linked Rejected and Approved Status Change steps."}

## Delete workflow steps

1. Hover over the step until the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** menu appears, then click on it.

2. Select **{{< fa gear >}} Delete**:

    - A confirmation dialogue will appear. Select **OK** to continue. 
    - The step will now be removed from the workflow.

3. When you are finished, click **Save workflow** to apply your changes.

### Remove links between steps

1. Hover over a connection until the **{{< fa circle-xmark >}}** appears.

2. Click **{{< fa circle-xmark >}}** to delete the connection:

    - A confirmation dialogue will appear. Select **OK** to continue. 
    - The connection will now be removed from the workflow.

3. When you are finished, click **Save workflow** to apply your changes.
