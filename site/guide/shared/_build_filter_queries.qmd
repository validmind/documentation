### How do I create effective filter queries?

On the **Select Your Filters** dialog, you can build complex filter queries with AND/OR logic and nested conditions. The filter system supports both core fields and custom fields, including attachments.

#### Add filter rules

1. Click **+ Rule** to add a filter condition.

2. Select a field from the dropdown. Fields are organized into groups:
   - **Core Fields**: Standard database fields (Name, Status, Business Unit, Tier, etc.)
   - **Stakeholders**: Owners, Developers, Validators, Custom Stakeholders
   - **Custom Fields**: Organization-specific fields (grouped by category)

3. Select an operator from the dropdown. Available operators depend on the field type:
   - **Text fields**: equals, not equals, contains, begins with, ends with, is empty, is not empty
   - **Number fields**: equals, not equals, greater than, less than, between, is empty, is not empty
   - **Date fields**: equals, not equals, before, after, between, is empty, is not empty
   - **Boolean fields**: equals, not equals, is empty, is not empty
   - **Multi-select fields**: in, not in, contains, is empty, is not empty

4. Enter or select a value based on the field type:
   - Text: Enter text or use textarea for longer content
   - Number: Enter numeric value or use range slider
   - Date: Use date picker
   - Boolean: Select checkbox
   - Select/Multi-select: Choose from dropdown with search
   - Entity fields (users, models): Select from dropdown with search

#### Add groups for complex logic

1. Click **Add group** to create a nested group of conditions.

2. Groups enable OR logic between sets of conditions. For example, you can create a query like: "Show items matching (condition A AND condition B) OR (condition C AND condition D)".

3. Groups can be nested multiple levels deep.

#### Combine rules and groups with AND/OR logic

- **Rules**: By default, multiple rules are combined with AND logic (all conditions must match).

- **Combinators**: Click the **AND** or **OR** button between rules or groups to change how conditions are combined.

- **AND logic**: All conditions must match.

- **OR logic**: At least one condition must match.

#### Supported field types

You can filter on:
- **Core fields**: Standard fields such as Name, Status, Business Unit, Tier, Use Case, Performance Rating, Owners, Developers, Validators
- **Custom fields**: All custom field types including text, number, date, boolean, single-select, multi-select, attachments, user fields, custom stakeholder fields, and calculated fields

#### Filter on attachments

For attachment fields, you can filter by:
- **File name**: Use the "contains" operator to search within file names
- **File type(s)**: Select one or more file types
- **File size**: Filter by file size or use size ranges

#### View and manage active filters

After applying filters, active filter conditions appear as individual chips below the page header with the label "Filtered by:". Each chip displays:
- Field name (human-readable)
- Operator (if applicable)
- Value(s) (formatted for display)
- Remove button ({{< fa xmark >}} icon)

Filter chips show the query structure:
- **AND** appears in gray between chips
- **OR** appears in orange between chips (to highlight OR logic)
- **Parentheses** indicate nested groups: `( ... )`

Example: `Filtered by: [status = Active ﾃ余 AND [tier = Production ﾃ余 OR ( [owner = John ﾃ余 AND [developer = Jane ﾃ余 )`

#### Remove individual filters

- Click the {{< fa xmark >}} button on any filter chip to remove that specific filter condition.
- The remaining filters are automatically reapplied.
- If removing a filter leaves no filters, all filters are cleared.

#### Smart query restructuring

When you remove individual filter chips, the system automatically restructures the query to maintain a valid filter state:
- Single-item groups flatten to the parent level
- Empty groups are automatically removed
- The query structure remains valid after each removal
