# NR This page exists only to provide a page we can link to from the filter modal in the product.
# The page is intentionally not included in the sidebar because the docs for the filter modal are already embedded in the correct context:
# - /guide/model-inventory/working-with-model-inventory.qmd
# - /guide/model-validation/view-filter-artifacts.qmd
