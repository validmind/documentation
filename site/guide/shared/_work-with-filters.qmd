Filtering supports simple and complex conditions using AND or OR logic with nested groups. You can filter on both the default fields created by {{< var vm.product >}} and custom fields created by your organization.

## Rules

Rules define individual conditions to filter by, such as the business unit or owner. 

To add a rule:

1. Click click **{{< fa plus >}} Add Rule** to add a filter condition. 
   
    A filter rule contains three components:

    ![](/guide/shared/select-your-filters-rule.png){width="90%" fig-alt="A new filter row with three components" .screenshot}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%" .pl4 .pr2}
Field selector
: Dropdown to choose the field type to filter by.
:::

::: {.column width="30%" .pl4 .pr3}
Operator selector
: Dropdown to select the comparison operator.
:::

::: {.column width="30%" .pl3}
Value editor
: Input area that varies based on the selected field type.
:::

::::

2. From the field selector dropdown, select one of:

:::: {.content-visible when-format="html" when-meta="includes.inventory"}
- **[model information]{.smallcaps}** — One of the model inventory fields always created by {{< var vm.product >}}, such as the Business Unit.
- **[stakeholders]{.smallcaps}** — Owner, Developer, or Validator, or custom stakeholders if applicable.
- **[model inventory fields]{.smallcaps}** — One of the organization-specific model inventory fields you added for your own use.

::::

:::: {.content-visible when-format="html" when-meta="includes.artifacts"}
- **[artifact information]{.smallcaps}** — One of the artifact fields always created by {{< var vm.product >}}, such as the Business Unit.
- **[assignees]{.smallcaps}** — User assigned to the Validation Issue type artifact.
- **[artifact fields]{.smallcaps}** — One of the organization-specific artifact fields you added for your own use.

::::

:::: {.content-visible when-format="html" when-meta="includes.both"}
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%" .pl4 .pr2}
[Model Inventory Filters]{.small-text}

- **[model information]{.smallcaps}** — One of the model inventory fields always created by {{< var vm.product >}}, such as the Business Unit.
- **[stakeholders]{.smallcaps}** — Owner, Developer, or Validator, or custom stakeholders if applicable.
- **[model inventory fields]{.smallcaps}** — One of the organization-specific model inventory fields you added for your own use.
:::

::: {.column width="50%" .pl4 .pr3}

[Artifact Filters]{.small-text}

- **[artifact information]{.smallcaps}** — One of the artifact fields always created by {{< var vm.product >}}, such as the Business Unit.
- **[assignees]{.smallcaps}** — User assigned to the Validation Issue type artifact.

5. (Optional) Add more rules by following the same steps.

6. Click **Apply Filters**.

## Groups

Groups combine multiple rules that are evaluated together and can be nested one level deep. You use groups for more complex filters, such as _Condition A AND (Condition B OR Condition C)_.

To add a group:

1. Click **{{< fa folder-plus >}} Add Group** to create a nested group of conditions.

2. Follow the same steps as in [**Rules**](#rules) to add one or several conditions to the group.

3. Click **Apply Filters**.

::: {.pl4 .pr4 .tc}
![<small>Example: Use case is Attrition/Churn Management AND (Business Unit is Commerical Banking OR Business Unit is Retail Banking)</small>](/guide/shared/select-your-filters-group.png){fig-alt="A rule AND a group of OR rules" .screenshot}
:::

## Combinators

Combinators define how multiple rules or groups are logically combined when matching conditions. By default, multiple rules are combined with **AND** logic, meaning all conditions must match. 

Supported combinators:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%" .pr5}
- **AND** — All conditions must match
- **OR** — At least one condition must match

To change the combinator:

1. Click the **AND** or **OR** button between rules or groups to change how conditions are combined.

2. Click **Apply Filters**.

::: {.column width="30%" .pr5}
![](/guide/shared/select-your-filters-combinators.png){fig-alt="The AND and OR combinators" .screenshot}
:::

::::


::: {.embed-tip}
### Why can't I use both AND and OR top-level combinators?

Combinators must evaluate logically for the filter to be applied: 

&ensp;{{< fa xmark >}} _Show items matching Condition A AND Condition B OR Condition C_<br>
&ensp;{{< fa check >}} _Show items matching Condition A AND (Condition B OR Condition C)_

{{< fa lightbulb >}} **To achive more complex filters, use groups.**
:::

## View active filters

After applying filters, active filter conditions appear as individual chips next to the label **{{< fa filter >}} Filtered by:**. 

- Field names
- Operators
- Values

## Remove active filters

Click the {{< fa xmark >}} icon on any filter chip to remove that specific filter condition. The remaining filters are automatically reapplied.

## Examples
[Available values depend on your organization's custom configuration]{.small-text}

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Simple single rule

Show models where _Model Inventory Field: `Risk Level` is `High`_ (requires that you have a custom select field called `Risk Level`):

1. On the Inventory page, click **{{< fa filter >}} Filter**.

2. Click **{{< fa plus >}} Add Rule**:

    - Field = `Model Inventory Field: Risk Level`
    - Operator = `equals`
    - Value = `High`

3. Click **Apply Filters**.

### Simple AND query

Show models that are _Model Stage: In Production AND in Business Unit: Risk Management_:

1. On the Inventory page, click **{{< fa filter >}} Filter**.

2. On the Select Your Filters dialog that opens, click **{{< fa plus >}} Add Rule**:

    - Field = `Model Stage`
    - Operator = `in`
    - Value = `In Production`

3. Add another rule:

    - Field = `Business Unit`
    - Operator = `in`
    - Value = `Risk Management`

4. Click **Apply Filters**.

### OR query with groups

Show models that are _(Model Stage: In Production AND in Business Unit: Risk Management) OR (Model Stage: In Production AND in Use: Attrition/Churn Management)_:

1. On the Inventory page, click **{{< fa filter >}} Filter**.

2. Click **{{< fa plus >}} Add Rule** to add your rules:

    a. First rule:
        - Field = `Model Stage`
        - Operator = `in`
        - Value = `In Production`
    b. Second rule:
        - Field = `Business Unit`
        - Operator = `in`
        - Value = `Risk Management`

3. Click **{{< fa folder-plus >}} Add Group** to create a new group:

    a. Change combinator to `OR` (between the two groups).
    b. In the new group, click **{{< fa plus >}} Add Rule** to add:

        i. First rule:
            - Field = `Model Stage`
            - Operator = `in`
            - Value = `In Production`
        ii. Second rule:
            - Field = `Use`
            - Operator = `in`
            - Value = `Attrition/Churn Management`

4. Click **Apply Filters**.

### Complex nested query

Show models where _(Model Stage: Active OR In Periodic Review) AND (Risk Level: High OR Medium) AND Owner: John Doe_:

1. On the Inventory page, click **{{< fa filter >}} Filter**.

2. Click **{{< fa folder-plus >}} Add Group** to add your groups:

    a. First group:
        - Field = `Model Stage`
        - Operator = `in`
        - Value = `In Production`, `In Periodic Review`
    b. Second group:
        - Field = `Model Inventory Field: Risk Level`
        - Operator = `equals`
        - Value = `High`, `Medium`

3. **{{< fa plus >}} Add Rule** to add a rule:

    - Field = `Owner`
    - Operator = `in`
    - Value = `John Doe`

5. Ensure all groups and rules use AND combinator.

6. Click **Apply Filters**.
