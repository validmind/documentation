Filtering supports simple and complex conditions using AND or OR logic with nested groups. You can filter on both the default fields created by {{< var vm.product >}} and custom fields created by your organization.

## [Rules]{.f4}

Rules define individual conditions to filter by, such as the business unit or owner. 

To add a rule:

1. Click **{{< fa plus >}} Rule** to add a filter condition. 
   
    A filter rule contains three components:

    ![](/guide/model-inventory/select-your-filters-rule.png){width="90%" fig-alt="A new filter row with three components" .screenshot}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%" .pl4 .pr2}
Field selector
: Dropdown to choose the field type to filter by.
:::

::: {.column width="30%" .pl4 .pr3}
Operator selector
: Dropdown to select the comparison operator.
:::

::: {.column width="30%" .pl3}
Value editor
: Input area that varies based on the selected field type.
:::

::::

2. From the field selector dropdown, select one of:

    - **Default fields**: One of the fields always created by {{< var vm.product >}}, such as the Business Unit.
    - **Stakeholders or assignees**: Owner, Developer, or Validator, if applicable.
    - **Custom fields**: One of the organization-specific fields you added for your own use.

3. From the operator dropdown, select one of:<br>[Available operators update based on the field selector]{.f7 .o-70}

| Text fields      | Date fields          | Number fields          | Boolean fields        | Multi-select fields   |

4. From the value editor, enter or select a value based on the field type:<br>[Value input changes based on field selector]{.f7 .o-70}

5. Optional: Add more rules by following the same steps.

6. Click **Apply Filters**.

## [Groups]{.f4}

Groups combine multiple rules that are evaluated together and can be nested one level deep. You use groups for more complex filters, such as _Condition A AND (Condition B OR Condition C)_.

To add a group:

1. Click **Add group** to create a nested group of conditions.

2. Follow the same steps as in [**Rules**](#rules) to add one or several conditions to the group.

3. Click **Apply Filters**.

::: {.pl4 .pr4 .tc}
![<small>Example: Use case is Attrition/Churn Management AND (Business Unit is Commerical Banking OR Business Unit is Retail Banking)</small>](/guide/model-inventory/select-your-filters-group.png){fig-alt="A rule AND a group of OR rules" .screenshot}
:::

## [Combinators]{.f4}


Combinators define how multiple rules or groups are logically combined when matching conditions. By default, multiple rules are combined with **AND** logic, meaning all conditions must match. 

Supported combinators:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%" .pr5}
- **AND**: All conditions must match
- **OR**: At least one condition must match

To change the combinator:

1. Click the **AND** or **OR** button between rules or groups to change how conditions are combined.

2. Click **Apply Filters**.

:::

::::


::: {.mt2 .pt3 .pb3 .pl4 .pr4 .br3 .bg-black-10 .o-70}
[Why can't I AND and OR top-level combinators?]{.f6 .b}

Combinators must evaluate logically for the filter to be applied: 

&ensp;{{< fa xmark >}} _Show items matching Condition A AND Condition B OR Condition C_<br>
&ensp;{{< fa check >}} _Show items matching Condition A AND (Condition B OR Condition C)_

{{< fa lightbulb >}} **To achive more complex filters, use groups.**

## [Examples]{.f4}

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Simple AND query

Show models that are _Active AND in the Credit Risk business unit_:

1. On the Inventory page, click **{{< fa filter >}} Filter**.

2. On the Select Your Filters dialog that opens, add rule: Field = `Status`, Operator = `equals`, Value = `Active`.

3. Add rule: Field = `Business Unit`, Operator = `equals`, Value = `Credit Risk`.

4. Click **Apply Filters**.

### OR query with groups

Show models that are _(Active AND in Credit Risk) OR (In Review AND in Market Risk)_:

## [View active filters]{.f4}

After applying filters, active filter conditions appear as individual chips next to the label **{{< fa filter >}} Filtered by:**. 

- Field names
- Operators
- Values

## [Remove active filters]{.f4}

Click the {{< fa xmark >}} icon on any filter chip to remove that specific filter condition. The remaining filters are automatically reapplied.
