Gain hands-on experience and explore what ValidMind has to offer with our training environment. 

The training environment mimics a production environment and includes comprehensive resources such as notebooks with sample code you can run, sample models registered in the model inventory, and draft documentation and validation reports.

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6}


Most of our model documentation features are available for you to test in the training environment, including automated model testing & documentation, preparing model validation reports, and large language model (LLM) support. 

These features provide a rich context for testing and evaluation, using models and datasets provided by ValidMind and hosted in our own environment.

## Onboarding

Step-by-step instructions: 

1. Get your access credentials from ValidMind. 

   If you haven't reached out to us yet, email <info@validmind.ai> to enquire about access to the training environment.

<!--- FUTURE step for self-signup
1. Get your access credentials for the {{< var vm_ui >}} by signing up with ValidMind: [{{< var vm_url >}}]({{< var vm_url >}})
   
   This is the login URL for our {{< var vm_ui >}} where you can look at the model inventory for the different models. 
--->

2. When you receive your access credentials, make sure you can log in:

   - ValidMind Jupyter Hub: <https://jupyterhub.validmind.ai/>
   - {{< var vm_platform >}}: [{{< var vm_url >}}]({{< var vm_url >}})

3. Join a kick-off session with ValidMind to get a free instructor-led hands-on demo.

   After we have received your request to try out the training environment, we will contact you to set up a kick-off session.

4. Try the training environment: [Getting started](#getting-started)

### Sample models

Sample models registered in the model inventory include:

- Housing prices prediction model
- Credit risk scorecard model
- Customer churn prediction model
- Interest rate time series forecasting model
- Large language model (LLM) demo application

Please note that we make updates to the models and datasets available in the training environment from time to time to provide you with our latest features. 

### Sample notebooks 

Each interactive notebook includes the sample code needed to automatically document a model: 

Notebook | Inventory model |
