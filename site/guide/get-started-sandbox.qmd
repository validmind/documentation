Gain hands-on experience and explore what ValidMind has to offer with our sandbox. 

The sandbox mimics a production environment and includes comprehensive resources such as notebooks with sample code you can run, sample models registered in the model inventory, and draft documentation and validation reports.

Most of our model documentation features are available for you to test in the sandbox, including automated model testing & documentation, preparing model validation reports, and large language model (LLM) support. 

These features provide a rich context for testing and evaluation, using models and datasets provided by ValidMind and hosted in our own environment.

### Sample models

Sample models registered in the model inventory include:

- Customer churn
- Credit scorecard model
- Large language model (LLM)

### Sample notebooks 

Each interactive notebook includes the sample code needed to automatically document a model: 

Notebook | Inventory model |
----------|-----------------|
| **[Quickstart for model documentation](https://jupyterhub.validmind.ai/hub/user-redirect/lab/tree/quickstart_customer_churn_full_suite.ipynb)**<br>Gets you started with the basic process of documenting models with ValidMind, from the developer framework to the Platform UI. | Customer Churn Model Documentation â€” Full Suite
