Workflows can be configured to match your organizational needs for overseeing model development, validation, or implementation activities.

Default workflows are provided for you as suggestions. You can customize the following default workflows:

- **Model documentation:** When documentation is created
- **Inventory model:** When the model is created

<!-- Model validation workflow is in missing as of May 2024 -->

::: {.callout-warning title="Adjustments to workflows are not retroactive."}
When a workflow is edited, the new flow will only apply to new models created after the adjustment. 
:::

## Prerequisites

- To customize workflows, you must hold the `Customer Admin` or `Developer` role
- [Resource statuses](customize-resource-statuses.qmd) must be fully configured

## Add or edit workflow steps

1. [Log in to the {{< var vm_platform >}}]({{< var vm_url >}}).

2. In the left sidebar, click [**{{< fa gear >}} Settings**]({{< var vm_url >}}/settings).

3. Under Workplace Settings, select **{{< fa arrow-right-arrow-left >}} Workflows**.

4. Under available workflows, select the process you'd like to add or edit the steps for:
 
    - To add a step, drag and drop a new step onto the canvas. Hover over the step until the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** menu appears, then click on it and select **{{< fa gear >}} Configure**.
    - To edit a step, hover over the step until the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** menu appears. Then click on it and select **{{< fa gear >}} Configure**.

5. After you're finished with step configuration, click **Save** to apply your changes before closing the configuration panel with **{{< fa x >}}**.

    When at least two steps have been configured, you can then [link steps together](#link-steps-together).

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
Refer to **[Available step types](#available-step-types)** for information on available step types and details on how to set up conditional requirements.
:::

#### Link steps together

1. Click **{{< fa circle >}}** above or below the earlier step and drag it to connect to the top **{{< fa circle >}}** on the subsequent step.

    You're also able to link several different steps together at various points in the workflow, including stages that may circle back to previous steps: 

    ![](linked-workflow.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing an example of multiple steps linked together at various points in the default Inventory Model workflow."}

6. When you are finished, click **Save workflow** to apply your changes.
