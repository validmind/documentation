Workflows can be configured to match your organizational needs for overseeing model development, validation, or implementation activities.

Default workflows are provided for you as suggestions. You can customize the following default workflows:

- **Model documentation:** When documentation is created
- **Inventory model:** When the model is created

::: {.callout-warning title="Adjustments to workflows are not retroactive."}
When a workflow is edited, the new flow will only apply to new models created after the adjustment.
