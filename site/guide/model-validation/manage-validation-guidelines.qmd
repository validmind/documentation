Edit the guidelines for validation reports to align them with organization's requirements, and add the guidelines to your report templates to ensure that they are ready for use.

To set up validation guidelines, you'll need to complete these two steps in sequence:

1. [Set up validation guidelines](#set-up-validation-guidelines)
2. [Add guidelines to templates](#add-guidelines-to-templates)

::: {.prereq}

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}

2. Under Workplace Settings, select **{{< fa align-left >}} Risk Areas & Validation Guidelines**.

3. Add, edit, or delete risk areas and their associated guidelines as required.

    - Once a risk area is added, you can then manage guidelines[^2] associated with that risk area.
    - Once guidelines are set up, you can then add them to your validation report templates.[^3]
