As you prepare your validation report, review open or past due model findings, close resolved ones, or add a mitigation plan:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

1. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.^[[Working with the model inventory](/guide/model-inventory/working-with-model-inventory.qmd#search-filter-and-sort-models)]

1. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Model Findings**.

    In the view that opens, all findings for the model that you are validating are shown. For example: 

    ![Sample model findings](sample-model-findings.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing several model findings" .screenshot}

1. Go through the open findings one-by-one:

    - **If the finding has been addressed:**

        - Add any final comments to assess how the issue was resolved. 
        - Under **[status]{.smallcaps}**, select `Closed`.

    - **If part or all of the finding remains to be addressed:**

        - Assess if the issue identified by the finding prevents the model from being approved.
        - If a remediation plan is required, enter the details in the **Remediation Plan** section of the finding.

1. Track open issues until all findings are resolved or a remediation plan is in place for post-approval issues.

::: {.callout-tip title="How should I assess open issues?"}
The decision to approve a model will depend on whether unresolved findings pose unacceptable risks and how well the mitigation plan addresses outstanding issues. Criteria include: 

High-severity findings (Level 1)
: These are issues that significantly affect model reliability, conceptual soundness, or compliance with regulations. Examples include incorrect model assumptions, data integrity issues, or failure to meet key risk thresholds. Critical findings must be resolved before a model can be approved, as they pose a substantial risk to the organization.

Medium-severity findings (Level 2)
: These are important but less severe issues, such as incomplete documentation, minor deviations in model performance, or gaps in testing. While they don’t prevent model approval outright, they often require a mitigation plan outlining steps to address the issues within a specified timeframe. The model may be approved with conditions, pending resolution.

Low-severity findings (Level 3)
: These are minor issues, such as small discrepancies that do not materially affect model performance or the risk profile. These findings usually don’t prevent model approval and can often be resolved post-approval as part of ongoing model maintenance.

        Criteria include:

        1. **High-severity findings** —
            Must be resolved before approval.
        
        2. **Medium-severity findings** —
            May allow conditional approval with a mitigation plan.
        
        3. **Low-severity findings** —
            Don’t prevent approval and are typically resolved post-approval with a mitigation plan.
