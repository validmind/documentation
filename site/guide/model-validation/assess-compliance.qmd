Use the {{< var validmind.platform >}} to assess compliance of your models with guidelines based on analyzing evidence and findings.

Compliance assessments provide an unbiased starting point that enables more efficient discussions between validators and developers and involves three steps:

1. [Link evidence to reports](#link-evidence-to-reports)
2. [Link findings to reports](#link-findings-to-reports)
3. [Provide compliance assessments](#provide-compliance-assessments)

::: {.attn}

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] The model you are validating is registered in the model inventory.[^1]
- [x] A model developer has submitted their model documentation for validation.[^2]
- [x] You are a [{{< fa circle-check >}} Validator]{.bubble} or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^3]

## Link evidence to reports

### Link developer evidence

{{< include _link-developer-evidence.qmd >}}

### Link validator evidence

::: {.callout}
To link validator evidence to a report, you must first log tests as a validator with the {{< var validmind.developer >}}.[^4]
:::

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^5]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **{{< fa file >}} Documents** and select a Validation Report type file.[^6]

   You can now expand any subsection of the validation report you would like to work with.

   For example, locate 2. Validation then select **2.1.1. Assumptions**.

4. In any section of the report where the button is available, click **{{< fa link >}} Link Evidence to Report**. 

   ![Validation report section 2.1.1. that shows a compliance assessment with the option to link evidence](/guide/model-validation/link-validator-evidence.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the validation report section 2.1.1. that shows a compliance assessment with the option to link evidence" .screenshot}

5. On the **Link Validator Evidence to Validation Report** page that opens, select the evidence that is related to your assessment. 
   
   If you are not sure if something is relevant, you can expand the section by clicking **{{< fa chevron-down >}}** for more details.

6. Click **Update Linked Evidence**.

   - Confirm that the newly linked-to evidence shown under Developer Evidence is accurate.
   - Evidence that needs your attention gets flagged with [{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Requires Attention]{.bubble .yellow-bg}. These sections get flagged automatically whenever a test result is above or below a certain threshold.

## Link findings to reports

{{< include _link-findings-to-reports.qmd >}}

## Provide compliance assessments

{{< include _provide-compliance-assessments.qmd >}}
