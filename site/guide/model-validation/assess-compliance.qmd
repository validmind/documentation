Use the {{< var vm.platform >}} to assess compliance of your models with guidelines based on analyzing evidence and findings.

Compliance assessments provide an unbiased starting point that enables more efficient discussions between validators and developers and involves three steps:

1. [Link evidence to reports](#link-evidence-to-reports)
2. [Link findings to reports](#link-findings-to-reports)
3. [Provide compliance assessments](#provide-compliance-assessments)
