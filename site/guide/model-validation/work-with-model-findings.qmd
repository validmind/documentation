Model findings are detailed observations identified during the model validation process, highlighting any major or minor issues, deficiencies, model limitations, stability and robustness concerns, or needed adjustments.

These findings are critical for understanding the risk exposure and compliance status of models within an organization. To make them easier to track, findings are typically categorized by risk area, business unit, model status, and individual model, enabling targeted resolution and informed decision-making to mitigate identified risks and ensure model reliability and accuracy.

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] The model is already registered in the model inventory.[^1]
- [x] Model documentation is completed or in progress for your model.[^2]
- [x] You are a `Validator` or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^3] 

:::

## View model findings

You can review findings for all models at once, or only look at findings linked to a specific model.

#### All model findings

To view findings for all models: 

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Model Findings**.

   In the page that opens is a list of all model findings, including information for:

   - Title
   - Severity
   - Status
   - Inventory model
   - Risk area
   - Assignee
   - Due date
   - Creation date

   Filter this list to only findings you want to see.[^4]

2. Click on any model finding for more information, including the proposed remediation plan.

#### Model-specific findings

To view findings linked to a specific model:

1. In the left sidebar, click **Model Inventory**.

2. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^5]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Model Findings**.

   In the page that opens is a list of findings associated with that particular model, including information for:

   - Title
   - Description
   - Severity by color
   - Status
   - Assignee
   - Due date

4. Click on any model finding for more information, including the proposed remediation plan.


## Filter model findings

By default, model findings for all models are displayed and sorted by creation date, with the latest findings displayed first. 

To narrow down the findings to only those you want to see, you can apply some filters:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Model Findings** for the list of all model findings.

2. Click {{< fa filter >}} **Filter**.

3. On the **Select Your Filters** dialog that opens, select your filtering criteria for:

   - Status
   - Model inventory
   - Risk area
   - Business units
   - Severity
   - Assignee

   For example, to filter by open findings for the `Customer Churn Model` assigned to `Jane Doe`:

   ![](filter.png){width=60% fig-alt="A screenshot of the filter dialog with some options selected"}

4. Click **Apply Filters**.

Filters can be removed by clicking on the {{< fa xmark >}} next to them on the main **{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Model Findings** page where the results are displayed. 

## Add model findings

{{< include _work-with-model-findings-add-findings.qmd >}}

#### Add finding via overview

To log a finding from the documentation overview: 

1. On your model's **Documentation** page, click **{{< fa plus >}} Add Finding**.

2. On the **Add Model Finding** page that opens, provide information for: 

   - Title
   - Risk area
   - Owner
   - Severity
   - Due date
   - Documentation section
   - Description

   <!-- At a minimum, you must provide the required information indicated by `*`. -->

3. When you are done, click **Save** to submit the finding. 

#### Add finding via section

While working within a section of your documentation, you can easily log a finding associated with that section without leaving the page:

1. Click on **ValidMind Insights™** to expand the insight panel.

2. For the section you want to add a Finding for, click **{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}}  Add Finding** beneath the Documentation Guidelines.

3. On the **Add Model Finding** page that opens,  provide information for: 

   - Title
   - Risk area
   - Owner
   - Severity
   - Due date
   - Documentation section
   - Description

   <!-- At a minimum, you must provide the required information indicated indicated by <b>*</b>.  -->
   
   The documentation section will be auto-populated with the section you are working from — you are able to select another section if desired.

4. When you are done, click **Save** to submit the finding. 

## Update model findings

As findings get resolved or require other changes during the model validation process, you can update them:

1. Locate the finding you want to update.[^6]

2. Make your updates to the finding. You can make updates to:

   - Title
   - Description
   - Proposed remediation plan
   - Status
   - Severity
   - Risk area
   - Due date
   - Assignee
   - Documentation section
   - Supporting documentation[^7]

Most updates are applied immediately but you must click **Save** to make changes to the finding description and proposed remediation plan effective. 

### Manage supporting documentation

After a finding is created, you're able to add supporting documentation to it.

#### Add attachment to finding

1. On the findings detail page under **Attachments**:

    - Drag and drop a file to upload.
    - Or, click **choose a file** to select your file manually.

2. Click **Upload File** to submit the file.

3. Click **Save** to apply the upload.
   
Attachments are listed with the following information:

   - Filename
   - File size
   - The user who uploaded the file

#### Remove attachment from finding

1. On the findings detail page under **Attachments**, locate the attachment you'd like to delete.
 
2. Click **{{< fa trash-can>}}** to remove the file. 

3. Click **Save** to confirm deletion. 

   After you confirm, the attachment will be removed from the finding.
