Model findings are detailed observations identified during the model validation process, highlighting any major or minor issues, deficiencies, model limitations, stability and robustness concerns, or needed adjustments.

These findings are critical for understanding the risk exposure and compliance status of models within an organization. To make them easier to track, findings are typically categorized by risk area, business unit, model status, and individual model, enabling targeted resolution and informed decision-making to mitigate identified risks and ensure model reliability and accuracy.

## View model findings

To view all project findings: 

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Model Findings**.

   In the page that opens, you can see a list of all model findings, including information for:

   - Title
   - Severity
   - Status
   - Inventory model
   - Risk area
   - Assignee
   - Due date
   - Creation date

2. Click on any model finding for more information, including the proposed remediation plan.

## Filter project findings

By default, all model findings for all models are displayed and sorted by creation date, with the latest findings displayed first. 

To narrow down the findings to only those you want to see, you can apply some filters:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Model Findings** and then click {{< fa filter >}} **Filter**.

2. On the **Select Your Filters** dialog that opens, select your filtering criteria for:

   - Status
   - Model inventory
   - Risk area
   - Business units
   - Severity
   - Assignee

   For example: To filter by open findings for the Customer Churn Model assigned to Jane Doe:

3. Click **Apply Filters**.

Filters can be removed by clicking on the {{< fa xmark >}} next to them on the main **{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Model Findings** page where the results are displayed. 

## Add project findings

1. In the left sidebar, click **Model Inventory**.

{{< include _work-with-model-findings-add-findings.qmd >}}

#### Add finding via overview

To log a finding from the documentation overview: 

1. On your model's **Documentation** page, click **{{< fa plus >}} Add Finding**.

2. On the **Add Model Finding** page that opens, provide information for: 

   - Title
   - Risk area
   - Owner
   - Severity
   - Due date
   - Documentation section
   - Description

   <!-- At a minimum, you must provide the required information indicated by `*`. -->

3. When you are done, click **Save** to submit the finding. 

#### Add finding via section

While working within a section of your documentation, you can easily log a finding associated with that section without leaving the page:

1. Click on **ValidMind Insights™** to expand the insight panel.

2. For the section you want to add a Finding for, click **{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}}  Add Finding** beneath the Documentation Guidelines.

3. On the **Add Model Finding** page that opens,  provide information for: 

   - Title
   - Risk area
   - Owner
   - Severity
   - Due date
   - Documentation section
   - Description

   <!-- At a minimum, you must provide the required information indicated indicated by <b>*</b>.  -->
   
   The documentation section will be auto-populated with the section you are working from — you are able to select another section if desired.

4. When you are done, click **Save** to submit the finding. 

## Update project findings

As project findings get resolved or require other changes during the model validation process, you can update them:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Model Findings**.

2. On the page that opens, click on the finding you want to update or apply a filter to locate the correct finding first.[^4]

3. On the page that opens, make your updates to the finding. You can make updates to:

   - Title
   - Description
   - Proposed remediation plan
   - Status
   - Severity
   - Risk area
   - Due date
   - Assignee
   - Documentation section

Most updates are applied immediately but you must click **Save** to make changes to the finding description and proposed remediation plan effective.
