   - **Some compliance** — Evidence provided but not properly documented or verifiable.
   - **Strong compliance** — Evidence provided and documented, but not validated.
   - **Full compliance** — Evidence provided, documented, and validated.

   For example, to indicate that there is some compliance based on the evidence or findings you linked to:

   ![Validation report section 2.1.1. that shows a compliance assessment with the option to link to finding](/guide/model-validation/assess-compliance.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the validation report section 2.1.1. that shows a compliance assessment with the option to link to finding" .screenshot group="compliance"}
