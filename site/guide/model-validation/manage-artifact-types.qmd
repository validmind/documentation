Prepare to track the progress and resolution of artifacts by customizing artifact types and their associated statuses available to be logged on models in your inventory.

#### Available artifact types

By default, the {{< var validmind.platform >}} provides three artifact types:

Validation Issue
: Problems discovered during model validation that reflect errors, inconsistencies, or gaps in data, methodology, implementation, or documentation that need to be addressed before the model is considered reliable.

Policy Exception
: When a model or part of its development or usage does not comply with internal policies, regulatory requirements, or governance standards, but an explicit approval or waiver is granted to allow it under controlled conditions.

Model Limitation
: Inherent weaknesses or constraints of the model itself that cannot be fully resolved; definitions under which the model's results should be interpreted with caution.

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] You are a [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^1]

:::

## Edit artifact type

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Artifacts, select **Artifact Types**.

3. Click on the artifact type[^2] you want to edit:

    - Validation Issue
    - Policy Exception
    - Model Limitation

4. Make your desired changes to the artifact type's details:

    - **[name]{.smallcaps}**
    - **[description]{.smallcaps}**
    - **[fields]{.smallcaps}** — Select the default artifact fields that should appear on this type of artifact.[^3]
    - **[create permissions]{.smallcaps}** — Model stakeholder types or user roles[^4] that can create this type of artifact.
    - **[update permissions]{.smallcaps}** — Model stakeholder types or user roles that can update existing artifacts of this type.
    - **[artifact statuses]{.smallcaps}** — Configure the statuses available to this artifact type.[^5]

### Manage artifact type statuses

::: {.callout}
`Open` and `Closed` are [Locked]{.bubble} stages, meaning they cannot be modified or removed.

:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Add artifact statuses

a. Click **{{< fa plus >}} Add Status**.

b. Enter in a **[name]{.smallcaps}** and assign a **[color]{.smallcaps}** to your artifact status.

c. When you are done, click **Add Status** to create your new status.

#### Edit or delete artifact statuses

a. Hover over the artifact status you'd like to modify.

b. When the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** appears, click on it and select:

    - **{{< fa pencil >}} Edit Details** to change the **[name]{.smallcaps}** or **[color]{.smallcaps}** of the status.
    - [**{{< fa trash-can >}} Delete Status**]{.red} to remove the status.

::: {.callout-important title="Artifact status deletion is permanent and cannot be undone."}

Artifact statuses cannot be deleted if in use on an artifact. Ensure that the status you're deleting is not associated with any artifacts before proceeding.
