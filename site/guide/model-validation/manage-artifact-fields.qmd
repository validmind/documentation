## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] You are a [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^1]

:::

## View, search, and filter artifacts fields

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Artifacts, select **Artifact Fields**.

    Displayed in groups[^2] as lists are the artifacts fields available to artifacts in your organization with a quick view of:[^3]

    - Number of workflows that field is used in[^4]
    - The field key
    - The field type[^5]
    - Field description
    - Whether or not the field is required when creating artifacts
    - Quick actions you can take on the artifact field

3. Narrow down existing artifacts fields available to your artifacts by searching or filtering for results:

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Search fields

a. Click **{{< fa magnifying-glass >}} Search** to search by keywords within an artifacts field.

b. Select whether to search in the **Title** or **Description**.

c. Click **Search** to narrow down your results by your entered keywords.

    Expand any inventory field group to see more fields.

#### Filter fields

a. Click **{{< fa filter >}} Filter** to filter fields by any of the following criteria:

    - **[artifact types]{.smallcaps}** — The types of artifacts that use this field.
    - **[required on creation]{.smallcaps}** — Whether or not the field was set up as required on artifact creation.
    - **[types]{.smallcaps}** — What type of field it is.
    - **[workflow triggered by field]{.smallcaps}** — What workflows are initiated when this field is edited.[^6]
    - **[write permissions]{.smallcaps}** — Which model stakeholder types have permissions to edit this field.[^7]

b. Click **Apply Filters** to narrow down your results by your configured criteria.

    Expand any inventory field group to see more fields.
:::

::: {.callout title="Note that searching and filtering of fields stack."}
For example, if you first search by keyword for `Regression` under **Title** without clearing that search, any additional filters applied will only apply to the results returned by that initial search.
