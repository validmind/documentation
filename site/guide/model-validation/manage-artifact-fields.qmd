## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] You are a [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^1]

:::

## View, search, and filter findings fields

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Findings, select **Finding Fields**.

    Displayed in groups[^2] as lists are the findings fields available to findings in your organization with a quick view of:[^3]

    - Number of workflows that field is used in[^4]
    - The field key
    - The field type[^5]
    - Field description
    - Whether or not the field is required when creating findings
    - Quick actions you can take on the finding field

3. Narrow down existing findings fields available to your findings by searching or filtering for results:

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Search fields

a. Click **{{< fa magnifying-glass >}} Search** to search by keywords within a findings field.

b. Select whether to search in the **Title** or **Description**.

c. Click **Search** to narrow down your results by your entered keywords.

    Expand any inventory field group to see more fields.

#### Filter fields

a. Click **{{< fa filter >}} Filter** to filter fields by any of the following criteria:

    - **[finding types]{.smallcaps}** — The types of findings that use this field.
    - **[required on creation]{.smallcaps}** — Whether or not the field was set up as required on finding creation.
    - **[types]{.smallcaps}** — What type of field it is.
    - **[workflow triggered by field]{.smallcaps}** — What workflows are initiated when this field is edited.[^6]
    - **[write permissions]{.smallcaps}** — Which model stakeholder types have permissions to edit this field.[^7]

b. Click **Apply Filters** to narrow down your results by your configured criteria.

    Expand any inventory field group to see more fields.
:::

::: {.callout title="Note that searching and filtering of fields stack."}
For example, if you first search by keyword for `Regression` under **Title** without clearing that search, any additional filters applied will only apply to the results returned by that initial search.
:::

## Add or edit finding fields
<span id="add-edit"></span>

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Findings, select **Finding Fields**.

    Here you can edit existing finding fields, or add a new one:

{{< include /guide/model-validation/_add-edit-finding-fields.qmd >}}

#### Finding field types

{{< include /guide/model-inventory/_field-types.qmd >}}

::: {.callout}
## Use finding types[^8] in your formulas to create dynamic calculations.

Use simple dot notation to include finding types:

- `finding_type.tag` — Technical tag: `VALIDATION_ISSUE`
- `finding_type.name` — Human-readable name: `Validation Issue`
:::


Example use cases:

- Calculate different risk scores based on finding type.
- Generate dynamic titles and descriptions.
- Set different due dates or priorities by finding category.
- Create type-specific business logic in formulas.

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Severity calculation

```python
# Calculate different severity scores based on finding type

if finding_type.tag == "VALIDATION_ISSUE":
    return severity_score * 2.5
elif finding_type.tag == "POLICY_EXCEPTION":
    return severity_score * 1.0
else:
    return severity_score * 1.8
```

#### Due date calculation

```python
# Dynamically calculate due dates based on finding type

base_days = 30
if finding_type.tag == "VALIDATION_ISSUE":
    urgency_multiplier = 0.5  # 15 days
elif finding_type.tag == "MODEL_LIMITATION":
    urgency_multiplier = 2.0  # 60 days
else:
    urgency_multiplier = 1.0  # 30 days

return base_days * urgency_multiplier
```

#### Custom fields & parent model data

```python
# Combine finding types with custom fields and parent model data

risk_factor = custom_field_risk_score or 1.0
model_criticality = params.model.get("criticality_level", "medium")

if finding_type.tag == "VALIDATION_ISSUE" and model_criticality == "high":
    return risk_factor * 3.0
else:
    return risk_factor * 1.5
```

:::


## Add finding field groups

To group finding fields, first create a finding field group:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Findings, select **Finding Fields**.

3. Click **{{< fa plus >}} Add Group** and enter in a **[name]{.smallcaps}** and a **[description]{.smallcaps}** for the group.

4. Click **Create Group** to add the new group.

5. Assign the desired fields to the group.[^9]

## Delete finding fields

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Findings, select **Finding Fields**.

3. Hover over the field you would like to delete.

4. When the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** appears under the Actions column, click on it and select [**{{< fa trash-can >}} Delete Field**]{.red}.

5. After you confirm, the field will be removed.
