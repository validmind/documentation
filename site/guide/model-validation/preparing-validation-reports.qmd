## Get started

1. In the left sidebar, click **Model Inventory**.

2. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^4]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Validation Report**.

   You can now jump to any section of the validation report by expanding the table of contents on the left and selecting the relevant section you would like to view.

4. You can now use content blocks to populate or edit information on your validation report.[^5]

     Whenever you make a change, an activity log entry is recorded under **Section activity** on the page, just below the section you are editing. 

5. Save your edits:

   a. Clicking on the {{< fa clock-rotate-left >}} icon in the editor toolbar.
   b. Select **Save current revision** and enter a name.
   c. Click {{< fa check >}} to save the revision.
