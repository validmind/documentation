## Get started

1. In the left sidebar, click **Model Inventory**.

2. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^5]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Validation Report**.

   You can now jump to any section of the validation report by expanding the table of contents on the left and selecting the relevant section you would like to view.

4. You can now add any **Risk Assessment Notes**, as well as assess compliance[^6] for each section of your validation report:

    - Validation guidelines are displayed under the header of each section of your report to help ensure that you are compliant with your organization's requirements.[^7]
    - Whenever you make a change, a log of the action is recorded under **Model Activity**.[^8]

5. For any **Risk Assessment Notes**, save your edits to retain your changes:

   - Clicking on the {{< fa clock-rotate-left >}} icon in the editor toolbar.
   - Select **Save current revision** and enter a name.
   - Click {{< fa check >}} to save the revision.

   You can also suggest changes and leave comments.[^9]

   ::: {.callout}
   Compliance assessments and linking evidence and findings are both saved automatically after selection.
