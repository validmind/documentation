## Validation Report Overview

The **Validation Report Overview** shows a section-by-section outline of your model's validation report, as well as summary of overall compliance.[^5]

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^6]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **{{< fa file >}} Documents** and select the **Latest** or **Saved Versions** tab.

4. Click on a Validation Report type file.[^7]

### Add or edit validation reports

1. From the **Validation Report Overview**, jump to any section of the validation report by clicking on the heading you would like to view.

2. Add **Risk Assessment Notes**, as well as assess compliance for each section of your validation report:

    - Validation guidelines are displayed under the header of each section of your report to help ensure that you are compliant with your organization's requirements.[^8]
    - Whenever you make a change, a log of the action is recorded under **{{< fa wifi >}} Model Activity**.[^9]

3. For any **Risk Assessment Notes**, save your edits to retain your changes:

   - Clicking on the {{< fa clock-rotate-left >}} icon in the editor toolbar.
   - Select **Save current revision** and enter a name.
   - Click {{< fa check >}} to save the revision.

   You can also suggest changes and leave comments.[^10]
