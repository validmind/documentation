4. In any section of the report where the button is available, click **{{< fa link >}} Link Finding to Report**. 

5. On the Link Finding to Report modal that opens, click **{{< fa plus >}} Create New Finding**. 

6. On the Add Model Finding modal that opens, provide information for: 

   - **[title]{.smallcaps}**
   - **[risk area]{.smallcaps}**
   - **[owner]{.smallcaps}**
   - **[severity]{.smallcaps}**
   - **[due date]{.smallcaps}**
   - **[documentation section]{.smallcaps}**
   - **[description]{.smallcaps}**

7. When you are done, click **Save** to submit the finding. 

## Update model findings

As findings get resolved or require other changes during the model validation process, you can update them:

1. Locate the finding you want to update.[^6]

2. Click on a field to make changes. You can make updates to:

   - **[title]{.smallcaps}** and **Description**
   - **Proposed Remediation Plan**
   - **[attachments]{.smallcaps}**[^7]
   - **[status]{.smallcaps}**
   - **[severity]{.smallcaps}**
   - **[risk area]{.smallcaps}**
   - **[due date]{.smallcaps}**
   - **[assigned to]{.smallcaps}**
   - **[documentation section]{.smallcaps}**

   You can also add comments to a finding.

Most updates are applied immediately but you must click **Save** to make changes to the finding title, description, proposed remediation plan, and attachments effective. 

### Track issue resolution

{{< include _track-issue-resolution.qmd >}}

## Delete model findings

::: {.callout-important title="Finding deletion is permanent."}
- While finding deletion will be logged under your {{< fa wifi >}} Model Activity,[^8] deleted findings cannot be retrieved.
- Deleting a finding will also remove it from any validation reports[^9] it was previously attached to.

1. Locate the finding you want to delete.[^10]

2. On the finding's detail page, click **{{< fa trash-can>}} Delete Finding** in the right sidebar.

3. After you confirm, the finding will be permanently deleted.
