#### Add finding via overview

To log a finding from the documentation overview:

   - Title
   - Risk area
   - Owner
   - Severity
   - Due date
   - Documentation section
   - Description

3. When you are done, click **Save** to submit the finding. 

   Once created, you can then add supporting documentation to your finding.[^4]

#### Add finding via section

While working within a section of your documentation, you can easily log a finding associated with that section without leaving the page:

1. Click on **{{< var vm.product >}} Insights™** to expand the insight panel.

2. For the section you want to add a Finding for, click **{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}}  Add Finding** beneath the Documentation Guidelines.

   - Title
   - Risk area
   - Owner

## Add findings on validation reports

When linking findings to validation reports,[^6] you can add findings as you assess a model's compliance:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^7]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **{{< fa shield >}} Validation Report**.

4. In any section of the report where the button is available, click **{{< fa link >}} Link Finding to Report**. 

5. On the **Link Finding to Report** modal that opens, click **{{< fa plus >}} Create New Finding**. 

6. On the **Add Model Finding** modal that opens, provide information for: 

   - Title
   - Risk area
   - Owner
   - Severity
   - Due date
   - Documentation section
   - Description

7. When you are done, click **Save** to submit the finding. 

## Update model findings

As findings get resolved or require other changes during the model validation process, you can update them:

1. Locate the finding you want to update.[^8]

2. Click on a field to make changes. You can make updates to:

   - Title
   - Description
   - Proposed remediation plan
   - Supporting documentation[^9]
   - Status
   - Severity
   - Risk area
   - Due date
   - Assignee
   - Documentation section

   You can also add comments to a finding. 

Most updates are applied immediately but you must click **Save** to make changes to the finding title, description, proposed remediation plan, and attachments effective. 

### Track issue resolution

{{< include _track_issue_resolution.qmd >}}

### Manage supporting documentation

After a finding is created, you're able to add supporting documentation to it. 

#### Add attachments to findings

::: {.callout}
Uploaded files must be less than 50 MB each in size.
:::

1. On the findings detail page, click on the **[attachments]{.smallcaps}** header.

{{< include /guide/model-inventory/_manage-supporting-documentation-add.qmd >}}

#### Remove attachments from findings

1. On the findings detail page, click on the **[attachments]{.smallcaps}** header.

{{< include /guide/model-inventory/_manage-supporting-documentation-remove.qmd >}}

## Delete model findings

::: {.callout-important title="Finding deletion is permanent."}
- While finding deletion will be logged under your {{< fa wifi >}} Model Activity,[^10] deleted findings cannot be retrieved.
- Deleting a finding will also remove it from any validation reports[^11] it was previously attached to.

:::

If you logged a finding in error or otherwise no longer need to track that finding, you can delete it: 

1. Locate the finding you want to delete.[^12]

2. On the finding's detail page, click **{{< fa trash-can>}} Delete Finding** in the right sidebar.

   Once you confirm, the finding will be permanently deleted.
