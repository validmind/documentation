1. Click **{{< fa plus >}} Create New Finding** to add a finding.

1. Enter in the details for your finding, for example:

    - **[title]{.smallcaps}** — Champion Logistic Regression Model Fails Minimum Accuracy Threshold
    - **[risk area]{.smallcaps}** — Model Performance
    - **[documentation section]{.smallcaps}** — 3.2. Model Evaluation
    - **[description]{.smallcaps}** — The logistic regression champion model was subjected to a Minimum Accuracy test to determine whether its predictive accuracy meets the predefined performance threshold of 0.7. The model achieved an accuracy score of 0.6136, which falls below the required minimum. As a result, the test produced a Fail outcome.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Select the finding you just added to link to your validation report.

1. Click **Update Linked Findings** to insert your finding.

1. Confirm that finding you inserted has been correctly inserted into section **2.2.2. Model Performance**  of the report.

1. Click on the finding to expand the finding, where you can adjust details such as severity, owner, due date, status, etc. as well as include proposed remediation plans or supporting documentation as attachments.
