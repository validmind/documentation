Add artifacts at the model or documentation section level, update your artifacts to include proposed remediation plans and supporting documentation, or delete artifacts that no longer need to be tracked.

::: {.attn}

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] The model is registered in the model inventory.[^1]
- [x] Model documentation is completed or in progress for your model.[^2]
- [x] Artifact statuses have been set up for use with artifacts.[^3]
- [x] You are a [{{< fa circle-check >}} Validator]{.bubble} or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^4]

:::

## Add artifacts on documentation

{{< include _add-artifacts-on-documentation.qmd >}}

## Add artifacts on validation reports

When linking artifacts to validation reports,[^5] you can add artifacts as you assess a model's compliance:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^6]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **{{< fa file >}} Documents** and select the **Latest** tab.[^7]

4. Click on a Validation Report type file.[^8]

5. In any section of the report where the button is available, click **{{< fa link >}} Link Artifact to Report** and select the artifact type[^9] you want to add:

   - Validation Issue
   - Policy Exception
   - Model Limitation

6. On the Link Artifact to Report modal that opens, click **{{< fa plus >}} Add {Artifact Type}**.

7. On the modal that opens, provide information for your artifact.

8. When you are done, click **Add {Artifact Type}** to submit the artifact.

## Update artifacts

As artifacts get resolved or require other changes during the model validation process, you can update them:

1. Locate the artifact you want to update.[^10]

2. Click on a field to make changes.

   You can also add comments to an artifact.

::: {.callout-important}
Most updates are applied immediately but you must click **Save** to make changes to the artifact title, description, proposed remediation plan, and attachments effective.
:::

### Track artifact resolution

{{< include _track-artifact-resolution.qmd >}}

### Manage supporting documentation

After an artifact is created, you're able to add supporting documentation to it.

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Add attachments to artifacts

::: {.callout}
Uploaded files must be less than 50 MB each in size.
:::

1. On the artifacts detail page, click on the **[attachments]{.smallcaps}** header.

{{< include /guide/model-inventory/_add-attachments.qmd >}}

#### Remove attachments from artifacts

1. On the artifacts detail page, click on the **[attachments]{.smallcaps}** header.

{{< include /guide/model-inventory/_remove-attachments.qmd >}}

:::

## Delete artifacts

::: {.callout-important title="Artifact deletion is permanent."}
- While artifact deletion will be logged under your {{< fa wifi >}} Model Activity,[^11] deleted artifacts cannot be retrieved.
- Deleting an artifact will also remove it from any validation reports[^12] it was previously attached to.

:::

If you logged an artifact in error or otherwise no longer need to track that artifact, you can delete it:

1. Locate the artifact you want to delete.[^13]

2. On the artifact's detail page, click **{{< fa trash-can>}} Delete {Artifact Type}**[^14] in the right sidebar.

3. After you confirm, the artifact will be permanently deleted.
