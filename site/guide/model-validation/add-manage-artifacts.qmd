## Add artifacts on validation reports

When linking artifacts to validation reports,[^5] you can add artifacts as you assess a model's compliance:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^6]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **{{< fa file >}} Documents** and select a Validation Report type file.[^7]

4. In any section of the report where the button is available, click **{{< fa link >}} Link Artifact to Report** and select the artifact type[^8] you want to add:

   - Validation Issue
   - Policy Exception
   - Model Limitation

5. On the Link Artifact to Report modal that opens, click **{{< fa plus >}} Add {x}** where `{x}` is the type of artifact.

6. On the modal that opens, provide information for your artifact.

7. When you are done, click **Add {x}** where `{x}` is the type of artifact to submit the artifact.

## Update artifacts

As artifacts get resolved or require other changes during the model validation process, you can update them:

1. Locate the finding you want to update.[^9]

2. Click on a field to make changes.

   You can also add comments to a finding.

::: {.callout}
Most updates are applied immediately but you must click **Save** to make changes to the finding title, description, proposed remediation plan, and attachments effective.
:::

### Track issue resolution

{{< include _track-issue-resolution.qmd >}}

### Manage supporting documentation

After a finding is created, you're able to add supporting documentation to it.

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Add attachments to artifacts

::: {.callout}
Uploaded files must be less than 50 MB each in size.
:::

1. On the artifacts detail page, click on the **[attachments]{.smallcaps}** header.

{{< include /guide/model-inventory/_add-attachments.qmd >}}

#### Remove attachments from artifacts

1. On the artifacts detail page, click on the **[attachments]{.smallcaps}** header.

{{< include /guide/model-inventory/_remove-attachments.qmd >}}

:::

## Delete artifacts

::: {.callout-important title="Finding deletion is permanent."}
- While finding deletion will be logged under your {{< fa wifi >}} Model Activity,[^10] deleted artifacts cannot be retrieved.
- Deleting a finding will also remove it from any validation reports[^11] it was previously attached to.

:::

If you logged a finding in error or otherwise no longer need to track that finding, you can delete it:

1. Locate the finding you want to delete.[^12]

2. On the finding's detail page, click **{{< fa trash-can>}} Delete {Finding Type}**[^13] in the right sidebar.

3. After you confirm, the finding will be permanently deleted.
