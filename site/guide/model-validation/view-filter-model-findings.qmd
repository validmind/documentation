To narrow down the findings to only those you want to see, you can apply some filters:

2. Click {{< fa filter >}} **Filter**.

3. On the **Select Your Filters** dialog that opens, select your filtering criteria for:

   - Status
   - Model inventory
   - Risk area
   - Business units
   - Severity
   - Assignee

   For example, to filter by open findings for the `Customer Churn Model` assigned to `Jane Doe`:

4. Click **Apply Filters**.

Filters can be removed by clicking on the {{< fa xmark >}} next to them on the main **{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Model Findings** page where the results are displayed.
