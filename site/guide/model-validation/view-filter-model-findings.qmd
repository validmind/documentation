## Filter and sort model findings

:::{.callout}
Changes are automatically saved to your account and do not affect other users.
:::

- By default, findings for all models are listed by creation date in descending order.
- To sort findings by a column in ascending ({{< fa angle-down >}}) or descending ({{< fa angle-up >}}) order, click on the column header.

To narrow down the findings, you can apply some filters:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Findings** for the list of all model findings.

2. Click **{{< fa filter >}} Filter**.

3. On the **Select Your Filters** dialog that opens, enter your filtering criteria.[^6]

   For example, to filter by open findings for the Customer Churn Model assigned to Jane Doe:

      - **[status]{.smallcaps}** — `Open`
      - **[model inventory]{.smallcaps}** — `Customer Churn Model`
      - **[assigned to]{.smallcaps}** — `Jane Doe`

4. Click **Apply Filters**.

Filters can be removed by clicking on the {{< fa xmark >}} next to them on the main **{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Findings** page where the results are displayed.

## Customize model findings layout
