#### All model findings

To view findings for all models: 

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Model Findings**.

   In the page that opens is a list of all model findings, including information for:

   - Title
   - Severity
   - Status
   - Inventory model
   - Risk area
   - Assignee
   - Due date
   - Creation date

   Filter this list to only findings you want to see.[^4]

2. Click on any model finding for more information, including the proposed remediation plan and any supporting attachments.

#### Model-specific findings

To view findings linked to a specific model:

1. In the left sidebar, click **Model Inventory**.

2. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^5]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Model Findings**.

   In the page that opens is a list of findings associated with that particular model, including information for:

   - Title
   - Description
   - Severity by color
   - Status
   - Assignee
   - Due date

4. Click on any model finding for more information, including the proposed remediation plan and any supporting attachments.


## Filter model findings

By default, model findings for all models are displayed and sorted by creation date, with the latest findings displayed first. 

To narrow down the findings to only those you want to see, you can apply some filters:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Model Findings** for the list of all model findings.

2. Click {{< fa filter >}} **Filter**.

3. On the **Select Your Filters** dialog that opens, select your filtering criteria for:

   - Status
   - Model inventory
   - Risk area
   - Business units
   - Severity
   - Assignee

   For example, to filter by open findings for the `Customer Churn Model` assigned to `Jane Doe`:

   ![](filter.png){width=60% fig-alt="A screenshot of the filter dialog with some options selected"}

4. Click **Apply Filters**.

Filters can be removed by clicking on the {{< fa xmark >}} next to them on the main **{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Model Findings** page where the results are displayed.
