1. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.

1. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Validation Report** and then locate **2. Validation**.

   You can now expand any subsection of the validation report you would like to work with.

   For example: Select **2.1.1. Assumptions**.

1. In any section of the documentation where the **Assessment** dropdown menu is available, select one of the available options:

   - No compliance — No tests have been run and no other evidence has been provided
   - Some compliance — Evidence provided but not properly documented or verifiable
   - Strong compliance — Evidence provided and documented, but not validated
   - Full compliance — Evidence provided, documented, and validated

   For example: To indicate that there is some compliance based on the evidence or findings you linked to:

1. On the **Link finding to report** page that opens, select from the list of available findings, or [create a new finding](/guide/model-validation/work-with-model-findings.qmd#add-project-findings). 

1. Under **Risk Assessment Notes**, add any relevant notes that explain your assessment further. 

A compliance summary gets shown for each subsection under **2. Validation** and provides a quick overview for current qualitative and quantitative risk assessments:
