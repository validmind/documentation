## Prerequisites

* You hold the `Developer` role
* The model you are documenting is registered in the model inventory
* Model documentation has already been created for this project
* A model developer has started generating documentation, either using the {{< var vm_framework >}} or via the online editor in the {{< var vm_platform >}}

Configuring the documentation guidelines for each template requires the `Customer Admin` role.

3. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.

4. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Documentation**.

5. In any section of the documentation for a model, click **ValidMind Insights** in the top right corner to expand the **ValidMind Insights** sidebar:
