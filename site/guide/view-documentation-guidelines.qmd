View the guidelines for model documentation associated with a template to ensure that you are compliant with documentation requirements.

## Prerequisites

* You hold the `Developer` role
* The model you are documenting is registered in the model inventory
* Model documentation has already been created for this project
* A model developer has started generating documentation, either using the ValidMind Developer Framework or via the online editor in the ValidMind Platform UI

Configuring the documentation guidelines for each template requires the `Customer Admin` role.

## Steps

1. [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_ui >}}).

2. In the left sidebar, click [**Model Inventory**](https://app.prod.validmind.ai/model-inventory).

3. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.

4. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Documentation**.

5. In any section of the documentation for a model, click **ValidMind Insights** in the top right corner to expand the **ValidMind Insights** sidebar:
