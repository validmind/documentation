Learn how to view the guidelines for model documentation associated with a template. This topic is relevant for model developers who need to ensure that they are following the guidelines for a template.  

## Prerequisites

* The model you are documenting is registered in the model inventory
* Model documentation has already been created for this project
* A model developer has started generating documentation, either using the ValidMind Developer Framework or via the online editor in the ValidMind Platform UI

Configuring the documentation guidelines for each template requires the `Customer Admin` role.

## Steps

1. [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_ui >}}).

2. In the left sidebar, click [**Model Inventory**](https://app.prod.validmind.ai/model-inventory).

3. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.

4. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Documentation**.

5. In any section of the documentation for a model, click **ValidMind Insights** in the top right corner to expand the **ValidMind Insights** sidebar:

   - The **Documentation Guidelines** tab shows the documentation guidelines associated with this documentation template that have been configured by your model validation team.
   - The **Comments** tab shows the comment threads associated with this section of the model documentation.
