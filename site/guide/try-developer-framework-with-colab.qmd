Learn how to access our introductory Jupyter notebook with Google Colaboratory.

## Prerequisites

You must have access to [Google Colaboratory (Colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/). 

Google Colaboratory (Colab) is a free Jupyter notebook environment that runs in the cloud. You can work with, run, and download our sample Jupyter notebooks from there.

## About our Jupyter notebooks
**Notebooks from ValidMind are safe to run** — If you get a warning that this notebook was not authored by Google, we welcome you to inspect the notebook source.
<br><br>
**Runtime errors** — We recommend that you not use the *Run all* option. Run each cell individually to see what is happening in the notebook. If you do see errors, re-run the notebook cells.
