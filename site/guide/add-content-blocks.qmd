Learn how to add a new content block to your documentation project, to write and update your model's documentation. 

## What are content blocks? 

Content blocks provide you with sections that are part of a template. You can think of these sections as an empty canvas that you fill in with text, metrics, and test results. Multiple sections are joined to create a longer document with a table of contents that has different heading and subheading levels, such as 1., 1.1., and so on. 

Types of content blocks: 

Simple text block
: Can be added anywhere on model documentation pages and edited to include additional documentation in text format.

Test-driven block
: Can be added to display one of the supported metrics or threshold test results collected by the Developer Framework.

## Prerequisites

- You are a registered user on the ValidMind Platform
- The model you are documenting is [registered in the model inventory](register-models.qmd)
- You are logged into the ValidMind Platform as a model developer

## Steps

1. Navigate to the relevant model documentation project:

    a. In the **Documentation Projects** page, select the project you want to edit.
    b. Inside your documentation project, navigate to the **Documentation** page.
    c. Select one of the numbered sections, such as **1.1 Model Overview**. 

2. In your documentation, hover your mouse over the space where you want your new block to go until a horizontal dashed line with a {{< fa square-plus >}} sign appears that indicates you can insert a new block:

    ![](add-content-block.gif){width=50%}

3. Click {{< fa square-plus >}} and then select one of the available options: 
    
    - **Simple text block**: Adds a new section with a blank content block. After the new content block has been added, click {{< fa pencil >}} to edit the contents of the section like any other.
    - **Test-driven block**: Select one of the options:
        - **Metric**: Select one of the available metrics, such as **Confusion Matrix**.
        - **Threshold test**: Select one of the available threshold tests, such as **Data Quality: Skewness** or **Model Diagnosis: Overfit Regions**.
    
4. For test-driven blocks, a preview of the available metrics or threshold test gets shown. Click **Insert module** when you are ready.

After you have completed these steps, the new content block becomes a part of your model documentation.

<!--- TO DO We might need to revisit terminology: we talk about "block", "section", and "module", but they all seem to be names for very similar things.--->
