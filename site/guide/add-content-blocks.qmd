Add to add content block story 
Conceptual info for templates: what a section is (empty canvas, join multiple section to end up at a ToC, like H1, H2, etc.; what goes inside is the content blocks), types of content block is (text, metric results (insert from metric), threshold test (insert from threshold test), how to discover what tests mean (including what configuration is available to you)
The user journey, the configuration, populating the error codes 

The documentation template is automatically applied based on the selected model details and documentation requirements configured by an administrator, such as your model risk management team.

Learn how to edit templates that get used for model documentation or for validation reports. This topic is relevant for administrators who need to configure templates for specific use cases or where the existing templates supplied by ValidMind need to be customized.

Documentation templates are stored as YAML files that you edit directly in the online editor. These templates are versioned and saving a documentation template after making changes or reverting to a previous version state always creates a new version.

Learn how to add a new content block to your documentation project, to write and update your model's documentation. 

## What are content blocks? 

Content blocks for the sections that are part of templates. You can think of these sections as an empty canvas that you fill in with bits of documentation. Multiple sections are joined to create a longer document with a table of contents that has different heading and subheading levels, such as 1., 1.1., and so on. 

Types of content blocks: 

- Simple text blocks, edited to include additional documentation in text format
<!--- NR commented out future block types that aren't available yet -->
<!--- - Metric results, inserted from a metric
- Threshold test, inserted from threshold test ---> 

## Prerequisites

- You are a registered user on the ValidMind Platform
- The model you are documenting is [registered in the model inventory](register-models.qmd)
- You are logged into the ValidMind Platform as a model developer

## Steps

1. Navigate to the relevant model documentation project:

    a. In the **Documentation Projects** page, select the project you want to edit.
    b. Inside your documentation project, navigate to the **Documentation** page.
    c. Select one of the numbered sections, such as **1.1 Model Overview**. 

2. In your documentation, hover your mouse over the space where you want your new block to go until a horizontal line with a {{< fa square-plus >}} sign appears that indicates you can insert a new block:

3. Click {{< fa square-plus >}} and then **Simple text Block** to add a new section with the blank content block.

After the new content block has been added, you can click {{< fa pencil >}} to edit the contents of the section like any other.
