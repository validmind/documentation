These steps show how a model developer can:

- Initialize the developer framework
- Add documentation
- Run tests and generate metrics
- Verify information is being sent to the ValidMind platform

## Prerequisites

 In order to initialize the developer framework and to be able to upload to the ValidMind platform, you must provide the following information:

- `api_host`: The location of the ValidMind API
- `api_key`: The account API key
- `api_secret`: The account secret key
- `project`: The project identifier

For existing projects, this information can be found in the ValidMind UI:

1. Go to the **Documentation Projects** page and select the project.

2. Click **CLIENT INTEGRATION** and scroll down to **Initializing the client library**.

3. Locate the code snippet and click **Copy to clipboard**. 

If you do not have an existing project, you can [create one](create-project.qmd). 

The developer framework also requires access to the data sources where data sets used for training, testing, and trained model files are stored. This access is needed to run model documentation and validation tests, and to upload to the ValidMind platform to populate the model documentation and validation reports.

## Initialize the developer framework

1. Install the client library:

    ```shell
    pip install validmind
    ```

2. Initialize the client library:

    Paste the code snippet with the client integration details directly into your development source code, replacing this example with your own:

    ```python
    import validmind as vm

    vm.init(
      api_host = "{{< var api_host >}}/tracking",
      api_key = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      api_secret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      project = "<project-identifier>"
    )
    ```

::: {.callout-important}
## Don't forget
 
Replace the API key and secret shown in these steps with your own.

After you have pasted the code snippet into your development source code and executed the code, the Python client library should initialize and successfully register with ValidMind. You can now use the developer framework to document and test your models, and to upload to the ValidMind platform.
