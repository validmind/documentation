Manage lifecycle processes within your {{< var validmind_platform >}} setup using workflows and transitions.

## Prerequisites

- The model is registered in the model inventory.[^1]
- You've already customized your resource statuses for use in workflows.[^2]

- You are assigned a role that has access to complete actions set up by workflows.[^4]

## See model statuses

To review the overall workflow status for a model:

2. In the left sidebar, click **Model Inventory**.

3. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^5]

4. On the landing page of your model, locate the Model Status section:

3. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^6]

    - The current workflow state will be highlighted on this detail view. 

## Transition workflow statuses

::: {.callout-important title="Roles and action visbility"}
Depending on the configuration of your workflows, you may or may not be able to move a model into another workflow state as actions can be gated to only users of certain roles. 

When all the actions that can be performed by your role are completed for that model or model documentation at that stage of the workflow, the Actions section will disappear from view. 
:::

To transition the overall workflow status for a model:

1. [Log into the {{< var validmind_platform >}}](/guide/log-into-validmind.qmd).

2. In the left sidebar, click **Model Inventory**.

3. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^7]

4. If an action is available to your role, you'll see it listed in the Actions section on the model's landing page.

    - Click **{{< fa arrow-right >}}** to open up the transition panel for your selected action. This arrow will be followed by the action name.
    - Enter your **Notes** then click **Submit**.
