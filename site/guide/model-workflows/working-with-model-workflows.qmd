## Transition workflow statuses

::: {.callout-important title="Roles and action visbility"}
Depending on the configuration of your workflows, you may or may not be able to move a model into another workflow state as actions can be gated to only users of certain roles. 

When all the actions that can be performed by your role are completed for that model or model documentation at that stage of the workflow, the Actions section will disappear from view.
