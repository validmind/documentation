{{< include _model-workflows-see.qmd >}}

![Detailed workflow under the MODEL STATUS section](see-workflow.gif){fig-alt="A gif showing the detailed workflow under the MODEL STATUS section"}

<!-- Model documentation stauses/workflows have been removed from the UI as of Aug 2024 -->

<!-- #### See model documentation statuses

To review the workflow status of a model's documentation:

1. In the left sidebar, click **Model Inventory**.

2. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^6]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Documentation**. 

    On this **Documentation** page, locate [document status]{.smallcaps}:

    - Click **{{< fa arrow-right-arrow-left >}} See workflow** to open the detailed workflow associated with that model's documentation.
    - The current workflow state will be highlighted on this detail view.  -->

## Transition workflow statuses

::: {.callout-important title="Roles and action visbility"}
Depending on the configuration of your workflows, you may or may not be able to move a model into another workflow state as actions can be gated to only users of certain roles. 

When all the actions that can be performed by your role are completed for that model at that stage of the workflow, the Actions section will disappear from view. 
:::

To transition the overall workflow status for a model:

{{< include _model-workflows-transition.qmd >}}

![Transitioning a workflow status under the ACTIONS section](transition-workflow.gif){fig-alt="A gif showing transitioning a workflow status under the ACTIONS section"}

<!-- #### Transition model documentation statuses

To transition the workflow status of a model's documentation:

1. In the left sidebar, click **Model Inventory**.

2. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^8]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Documentation**.

4.  If an action is available to your role, you'll see it listed under your document status under your **Documentation** or **Validation Report**. 

    - Click **{{< fa arrow-right >}}** to open up the transition panel for your selected action. This arrow will be followed by the action name.
    - Enter your **Notes** then click **Submit**.  -->

### Reset your model workflow
