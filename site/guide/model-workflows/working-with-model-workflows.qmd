## Transition workflow statuses

::: {.callout-important title="Roles and action visbility"}
Depending on the configuration of your workflows, you may or may not be able to move a model into another workflow state as actions can be gated to only users of certain roles. 

When all the actions that can be performed by your role are completed for that model or model documentation at that stage of the workflow, the Actions section will disappear from view. 
:::

To transition the overall workflow status for a model:

1. In the left sidebar, click **Model Inventory**.

2. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^7]

3. If an action is available to your role, you'll see it listed under your model status on the model's landing page.

    - Click **{{< fa arrow-right >}}** to open up the transition panel for your selected action. This arrow will be followed by the action name.
    - Enter your **Notes** then click **Submit**.
