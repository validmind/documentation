1. Continue with linking the rest your steps together.

#### b. Link steps together

To link subsequent steps together:

- Click the **{{< fa circle >}}** below or to the right or left of the earlier step and drag it to connect to the top **{{< fa circle >}}** on the subsequent step.

##### Link approval steps

{{< fa users >}} Approval steps need to be subsequently linked to both a [Rejected]{.bubble .red .red-bg} and an [Approved]{.bubble .green .green-bg} {{< fa cube >}} Model Stage Change step:^[[Setting up model workflows](/guide/model-workflows/setting-up-model-workflows.qmd#workflow-step-types)]

1. First, configure an **{{< fa users >}} Approval** step.

1. Then, drag two **{{< fa cube >}} Model Stage Change** steps onto the canvas:

    - Assign a stage associated with rejection to one in the **[set model stage to]{.smallcaps}** field.
    - Assign a stage associated with approval to the other in the **[set model stage to]{.smallcaps}** field.

1. Then, from the bottom of your **{{< fa users >}} Approval** step:

    a. Connect the left [**{{< fa circle >}}**]{.red} (red) to your rejection step.^[When complete, the workflow arrow will display as [Rejected]{.bubble .red .red-bg}.]
    b. Connect the right [**{{< fa circle >}}**]{.green} (green) to your approval step.^[When complete, the workflow arrow will display as [Approved]{.bubble .green .green-bg}.]

#### c. End the workflow

When all your workflow steps have been linked together:

1. Designate the end of your workflow by dragging an **{{< fa circle-stop >}} End** step onto the canvas.

1. Link relevant previous steps to the **{{< fa circle-stop >}} End** step by clicking on the bottom **{{< fa circle >}}** of those steps, and dragging to the top **{{< fa circle >}}** of the **{{< fa circle-stop >}} End** step.
