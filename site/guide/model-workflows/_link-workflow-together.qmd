a. Continue with linking the rest your steps together.

#### 2. Link steps together

To link subsequent steps together:

- Click the **{{< fa circle >}}** below or to the right or left of the earlier step and drag it to connect to the top **{{< fa circle >}}** on the subsequent step.

##### Link approval steps

{{< fa users >}} Approval steps need to be subsequently linked to both a [Rejected]{.bubble .red .red-bg} and an [Approved]{.bubble .green .green-bg} {{< fa cube >}} Model Stage Change step:^[[Workflow step types](/guide/model-workflows/setting-up-workflows.qmd#workflow-step-types)]

a. Designate the end of your workflow by dragging an **{{< fa circle-stop >}} End** step onto the canvas.

a. Link relevant previous steps to the **{{< fa circle-stop >}} End** step by clicking on the bottom **{{< fa circle >}}** of those steps, and dragging to the top **{{< fa circle >}}** of the **{{< fa circle-stop >}} End** step.
