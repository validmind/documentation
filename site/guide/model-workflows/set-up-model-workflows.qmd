<!-- A variant of this introductory section lives in training-for-administrators.qmd -->
Workflows can be configured to match your organizational needs for overseeing model development, validation, or implementation activities.

Default workflows are provided for you as suggestions. You can customize the following default workflows:

- **Model documentation** 
- **Inventory model**

<!-- 
- Model validation workflow is in missing as of May 2024
- These default workflows will eventually be replaced by a trigger you can define
 -->

To set up a workflow, you'll need to complete these two steps in sequence:

 1. [Configure the workflow steps](#configure-workflow-steps) 
 2. [Link the workflow together](#link-workflow-together)


 <!-- The following is no longer true as of May 31, 2024: -->

<!-- ::: {.callout-important title="Adjustments to workflows are not retroactive."}
When a workflow is edited, the new flow will only apply to new models created after the adjustment. 
::: -->

## Prerequisites

- To customize workflows, you must hold the `Customer Admin` role^1^
- Resource statuses must be fully configured^2^

## Configure workflow steps

To add or edit workflow steps:

1. Log in to the {{< var vm_login >}}.

2. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

3. Under Workplace Settings, select **{{< fa arrow-right-arrow-left >}} Workflows**.

4. Under Available Workflows, select the process you'd like to add or edit the steps for:
 
    - To add a step, drag and drop a new step onto the canvas. Hover over the step until the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** menu appears, then click on it and select **{{< fa gear >}} Configure**.
    - To edit a step, hover over the step until the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** menu appears. Then click on it and select **{{< fa gear >}} Configure**.

5. After you're finished with step configuration, click **Save** to apply your changes before closing the configuration panel with **{{< fa x >}}**.

6. After you've configured a step, you can then [link your workflow together](#link-workflow-together).

### Available step types

#### Status Change

- Transitions a status. 
- Requires available resource statuses associated with the workflow^3^.

| Field | Description |
|---:|---|
| When these conditions are met (optional) | Add conditional requirements to qualify for this step^4^.  |
| Set status to (required) | Select the status to transition to. |

#### User Action
- Creates a button that performs an action on behalf of the user. 
- Requires available resource statuses associated with the workflow^5^.

| Field | Description |
|---:|---|
| Display action button when (optional) | Add conditional requirements for displaying this step^6^.  |
| Action button label (required) | Text that displays on your action button. |

Example
: A `Put On Hold` action that requests a value in the Date On Hold field, and transitions the resource status to On Hold.

#### Approval
- When your resource reaches the approval step, users in the selected **Approval Group** will receive your configured message. 
- Requires a **User Type** custom field^8^ to select from, and must be connected to both an approval and rejection Status Change step^9^.

::: callout 
Please note that users must be assigned to the **Approval Group** custom field before it is transitioned into the **Approval** workflow step in order for the message to be displayed to them. 
:::

| Field | Description |
|---:|---|
| Approval group (required) | Select the **User Type** custom field that indicates users responsible for approval. |
| Threshold (required) | Percentage of approvers required for the resource to be approved^10^. |
| Approval Message (required) | When your resource reaches this approval step, the users in the selected group will recieve the following message. |

### Add conditional requirements

Conditional requirements can be configured for all three available step types:

| Step type | Conditional options |
|---:|---|
| Status Change | Under **When these conditions are met**, you are able to set both `AND` and `OR` conditions. |
| User Action | Under **Display action button when**, you are able to set both `AND` and `OR` conditions.  |
| Approval | Under **Threshold**, you are able to set the minimum percentage of approvers required for the resource to be approved. |
: Step type conditional options {.hover tbl-colwidths="[20,80]"}

For Status Change^11^ and User Action^12^ conditions, you're able to add a single independent **Rule** or a linked condition **Group**. These rules and groups can be nested if desired:

- Click **+ Rule** to add an independent rule.
- Click **+ Group** to add a linked group of rules that all must be true to qualify.

## Link workflow together

To initiate the beginning of your workflow^13^:

1. Locate the **Start** of your workflow.

2. Drag from the period (**.**) at the bottom of **Start** to the top **{{< fa circle >}}** on the first step of your workflow.

::: {.column-margin}
^13^ After youâ€™ve [configured your workflow steps](#configure-workflow-steps), you can then link your workflow together.
:::

### Link steps together

To link subsequent steps together:

1. Click **{{< fa circle >}}** above or below the earlier step and drag it to connect to the top **{{< fa circle >}}** on the subsequent step.

    You're also able to link several different steps together at various points in the workflow, including stages that may circle back to previous steps: 

    ![](linked-workflow.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing an example of multiple steps linked together at various points in the default Inventory Model workflow."}

6. When you are finished, click **Save workflow** to apply your changes.

#### Link approval steps
Approval steps need to be subsequently linked to both a `Rejected` and an `Approved` Status Change step:

1. First, configure an **Approval** step^14^. 

2. Then, drag two **Status Change** steps onto the canvas^15^:

    - Assign a `Rejected` status to one in the **Set Document Status** field.
    - Assign an `Approved` status to the other in the **Set Document Status** field.

3. Connect the **Approval** step to the `Rejected` and `Approved` **Status Change** steps with the red and green **{{< fa circle >}}** respectively by dragging from the colored **{{< fa circle >}}** to the top **{{< fa circle >}}** of the subsequent step.
