<!-- A variant of this introductory section lives in training-for-administrators.qmd -->
Workflows can be configured to match your organizational needs for overseeing model development, validation, or implementation activities.

<!-- Model documentation stauses/workflows have been removed as of Aug 2024 -->

<!-- Default workflows are provided for you as suggestions. You can customize the following default workflows:

- **Model Documentation** 
- **Inventory Model** -->

To set up a workflow, you'll need to complete these two steps in sequence:

 1. [Configure the workflow steps](#configure-workflow-steps) 
 2. [Link the workflow together](#link-workflow-together)


 <!-- The following is no longer true as of May 31, 2024: -->

<!-- ::: {.callout-important title="Adjustments to workflows are not retroactive."}
When a workflow is edited, the new flow will only apply to new models created after the adjustment. 
::: -->

::: {.attn}

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] Model lifecycle statuses must be fully configured.[^1]
- [x] You are a [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^2]

## Configure workflow steps

{{< include _configure-workflow-steps.qmd >}}

### Available step types

#### Status Change

- Transitions a status. 
- Requires available model lifecycle statuses associated with the workflow.[^3]

| Field | Description |
|---:|---|
| [when these conditions are met]{.smallcaps} (optional) | Add conditional requirements to qualify for this step.[^4]  |
| [set status to]{.smallcaps} | Select the status to transition to. |
: **Status Change** step configuration {.hover tbl-colwidths="[40,60]"}


#### User Action
- Creates a button that performs an action on behalf of the user. 
- Requires available model lifecycle statuses associated with the workflow.[^5]

| Field | Description |
|---:|---|
| [display action button when]{.smallcaps}  (optional) | Add conditional requirements for displaying this step.[^6]  |
| [action button label]{.smallcaps} | Text that displays on your action button. |

#### Approval
- When your resource reaches the approval step, roles or users in the selected **Approval Group** will receive your configured message. 
- Requires either a **User Role**[^8] or **User Type** inventory field[^9] to select from, and must be connected to both an approval and rejection Status Change step.[^10]

::: callout 
Please note that roles or users must be assigned to the **Approval Group** field before the workflow is transitioned into the **Approval** step in order for the message to be displayed to those roles or users. 
:::

| Field | Description |
|---:|---|
| [approval group]{.smallcaps}  | Select the **User Role** or **User Type** inventory field that indicates roles or users responsible for approval. |
| [threshold]{.smallcaps} | Percentage of approvers required for the resource to be approved.[^11] |
| [approval message]{.smallcaps} | When your resource reaches this approval step, the users in the selected group will recieve the following message. |
: **Approval Group** step configuration {.hover tbl-colwidths="[35,65]"}

![Setup for the Approval Message shown to the APPROVAL GROUP of User Roles — Validator](approval-group-setup.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing the setup for the Approval Message shown to the APPROVAL GROUP of User Roles — Validator" .screenshot group="approval"}

Example
: A message shown to the User Roles — Validator requesting review of a model for compliance.

:::

::::

#### Condition Branch
- Allows diverging paths based on conditional requirements.
- A `default` branch will be automatically included as a catch-all `else` path to ensure that your conditional logic is complete.

::: {.callout-important}
Workflows cannot be saved until condition branches are connected to other steps.
:::

To configure a condition branch:

1. On the Configure Condition Branch modal, click **{{< fa plus >}} Add Branch**.
2. Enter in the **[path name]{.smallcaps}** and designate the **[conditions]{.smallcaps}**[^12] that apply to this path.
3. Continue with steps 1 and 2 until your conditional branch logic is complete.

    To remove a path, click **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** and select **{{< fa trash-can >}} Remove Path**.
4. When you are finished setting up all your branch paths, click **Update Step** to save your step.

    Proceed with linking the Condition Branch with your subsequent steps.[^13]

For example, if you wanted your models where the field `GenAI Model` is set to `true` to undergo a special legal approval process:

- First, you'd set up a Condition Branch path to look for instances where `GenAI Model` is set to `true`.
- Then, you would add an Approval step[^14] that requests a review of the model from the User Roles — `Legal Team`.
- Finally, configure the `default` path to bypass this special approval. 

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-50-ns}
![CONDITION BRANCH step configuration with condition of GenAI Model = `true`](configure-condition-branch.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing a CONDITION BRANCH step configuration with condition of GenAI Model = `true`" .screenshot group="condition"}

![Example Condition Branch where GenAI models require special approval from the User Roles — Legal Team](example-condition-branch.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing an example Condition Branch where GenAI models require special approval from the User Roles — Legal Team" .screenshot group="condition"}

:::

#### Wait

- Creates a time condition for displaying next available action.
- Used to enforce a time delay or a calendar date milestone. 

::: {.callout title="Time stamp configuration is in the current user's timezone."}
Other users viewing those fields or the workflow will see the value automatically in their timezone. 
:::

To configure a wait step, select when you would like to [resume workflow]{.smallcaps}: 

| Option | Required field | Description | 
|---:|---|---|
| After Time Interval  | [wait duration]{.smallcaps} | Wait for a set amount of time in minutes, hours, or days. Applies to all models under the workflow. |
| At Specified Date | [wait until]{.smallcaps} | Wait until a specific timestamp. Applies to all models under the workflow. If the milestone date inputted is in the past, the next workflow step will display immediately. |
| At Specified Date on Model Field | [model field]{.smallcaps}[^15] | Wait until a specific timestamp as defined by a valid `Date` or `Date Time` type model inventory field on a per model basis. If the selected field is empty[^16] or the milestone date inputted is in the past, the next workflow step will display immediately. |
: **Wait** step configuration {.hover tbl-colwidths="[30,15,45]"}

### Add conditional requirements

Conditional requirements can be configured for all four available step types:

| Step type | Conditional options |
|---:|---|
| Status Change | Under **[when these conditions are met]{.smallcaps}**, you are able to set both `AND` and `OR` conditions. |
| User Action | Under **[display action button when]{.smallcaps}**, you are able to set both `AND` and `OR` conditions.  |
| Approval | Under **[threshold]{.smallcaps}**, you are able to set the minimum percentage of approvers required for the resource to be approved. |
| Condition Branch | Under each branch's **[conditions]{.smallcaps}**, you're able to designate the `AND` and `OR` conditions that apply to that path. |
: Step type conditional options {.hover tbl-colwidths="[20,80]"}

For Status Change[^17], User Action[^18], and Condition Branch[^19] conditions, you're able to add a single independent **Rule** or a linked condition **Group**. These rules and groups can be nested if desired:

- Click **{{< fa plus >}} Rule** to add an independent rule.
- Click **{{< fa plus >}} Group** to add a linked group of rules that all must be true to qualify. 

## Link workflow together

{{< include _link-workflow-steps.qmd >}}

#### Link approval steps
Approval steps need to be subsequently linked to both a [Rejected]{.bubble .red .red-bg} and an [Approved]{.bubble .green .green-bg} Status Change step:

1. First, configure an **Approval** step.[^20]

2. Then, drag two **Status Change** steps onto the canvas:[^21]

    - Assign a `Rejected` status to one in the **Set Document Status** field.
    - Assign an `Approved` status to the other in the **Set Document Status** field.

3. Connect the **Approval** step to the [Rejected]{.bubble .red .red-bg} and [Approved]{.bubble .green .green-bg} **Status Change** steps with the red and green **{{< fa circle >}}** respectively by dragging from the colored **{{< fa circle >}}** to the top **{{< fa circle >}}** of the subsequent step.

:::

## Delete workflow steps

1. Hover over the step until the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** menu appears, then click on it.

2. Select **{{< fa gear >}} Delete**.

    On the confirmation dialogue that appears, select **OK** to confirm deletion.

3. When you are finished, click **Save Workflow** to apply your changes.

### Remove links between steps

1. Hover over a connection until the **{{< fa circle-xmark >}}** appears.

2. Click **{{< fa circle-xmark >}}** to delete the connection.

    On the confirmation dialogue that appears, select **OK** to confirm deletion.

3. When you are finished, click **Save Workflow** to apply your changes.
