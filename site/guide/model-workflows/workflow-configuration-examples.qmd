Learn from example workflow configurations to help you tailor workflows to fit your organization's requirements for managing model risk throughout your entire model lifecycles.

## Example model lifecycle

## Workflow step type examples**

### User Action

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-50-ns .mt2}

:::

::: {.w-40-ns .mt2}

![Action transition panel with the Date on Hold inventory field](user-action-inventory-field.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing the action transition panel with the Date On Hold inventory field" .screenshot group="user-action"}

Example

### Condition Branch

For example, if you wanted your models where the field `GenAI Model` is set to `true` to undergo a special legal approval process:

- First, you'd set up a Condition Branch path to look for instances where `GenAI Model` is set to `true`.
- Then, you would add an Approval step[^14] that requests a review of the model from the User Roles — `Legal Team`.
- Finally, configure the `default` path to bypass this special approval. 

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-50-ns}
![CONDITION BRANCH step configuration with condition of GenAI Model = `true`](configure-condition-branch.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing a CONDITION BRANCH step configuration with condition of GenAI Model = `true`" .screenshot group="condition"}

::: {.w-50-ns}
![Legal Team Approval step configuration](legal-team-approval.png){fig-alt="Screenshot showing the Legal Team Approval step configuration" .screenshot group="condition"}
