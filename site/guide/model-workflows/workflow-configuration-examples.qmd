Learn from example workflow configurations to help you tailor workflows to fit your organization's requirements for managing model risk throughout your entire model lifecycles.

## Example workflows

To cover activities in their model lifecycle up to model deployment, an organization has the following workflows configured:

::: {.panel-tabset}

### On model registration

This workflow initiates upon model registration[^1] — when models are added to the **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**, and covers model development activities, including documentation of the model.

- This particular organization pairs their developers into teams of two, where one develops and initially documents the model, and the other peer reviews and approves the model for official validation, requesting revisions if the documentation is incomplete.
- They meticulously transition the model through the stages[^2] of their development cycle with this workflow, as well as transition the workflow into linked states.[^3]

:::

### On model validation

This workflow is initiated when a field is populated — in this case, when the model development team submits their model for validation and enters in a date in the [submitted for validation]{.smallcaps} field via the **Submit for Validation** action step in the previous *On model registration* workflow.[^4]

- In this workflow, the model stage[^5] remains as [in initial validation]{.smallcaps} throughout, while the state of the workflow[^6] transitions to reflect the status of validation.
- The option to develop potential challenger models is at the discretion of the validator, or they can choose to approve the champion model without submitting additional challengers.
- Depending on whether or not the model is a GenAI model, the validation report is also submitted for additional review to the organization's legal team before approval.

### On model deployment

This workflow is initiated manually, when validation is complete and the model is ready for implementation.

![User Action step configuration with a request field of Date on Hold](configure-user-action.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing a User Action step configuration with a request field of Date On Hold" .screenshot group="user-action"}

:::

::: {.w-40-ns .mt2}

![Action transition panel with the Date on Hold inventory field](user-action-inventory-field.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing the action transition panel with the Date On Hold inventory field" .screenshot group="user-action"}

Example
: A `Put On Hold` action that requests a value in the Date On Hold field, and transitions the model lifecycle status to <br>[On Hold]{.bubble}.

#### {{< fa users >}} Approval

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-50-ns}
![APPROVAL GROUP step configuration with a User Roles selection of Validator](configure-approval-step.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing an APPROVAL GROUP step configuration with a User Roles selection of Validator" .screenshot group="approval"}

:::

::: {.w-40-ns}
![Setup for the Approval Message shown to the APPROVAL GROUP of User Roles — Validator](approval-group-setup.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing the setup for the Approval Message shown to the APPROVAL GROUP of User Roles — Validator" .screenshot group="approval"}

Example
: A message shown to the User Roles — Validator requesting review of a model for compliance.

::::

#### {{< fa maximize >}} Condition Branch

For example, if you wanted your models where the field `GenAI Model` is set to `true` to undergo a special legal approval process:

- First, you'd set up a Condition Branch path to look for instances where `GenAI Model` is set to `true`.
- Then, you would add an Approval step[^14] that requests a review of the model from the User Roles — `Legal Team`.
- Finally, configure the `default` path to bypass this special approval.
