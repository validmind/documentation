Configure workflows to match your organizational needs throughout your model lifecycles. Workflows can be as simple or as complex as required, with multiple and discrete workflows supported for unique triggers and scenarios.

::: {.attn}

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] Model stages must be fully configured.[^1]
- [x] You are a [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^2]

## Create a custom workflow

To set up a new custom workflow, you'll need to complete these three steps in sequence:

 1. [Add a new workflow](#add-workflows)
 2. [Configure the workflow steps](#configure-workflow-steps)
 3. [Link the workflow together](#link-workflow-together)

### Add workflows

To add a new blank workflow:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Workspace, select **Workflows**.

3. Click **{{< fa plus >}} Add Workflow**.

4. On the Add New Workflow modal, enter in a **[title]{.smallcaps}** and a **[description]{.smallcaps}** the workflow.

5. Under **[workflow start]{.smallcaps}**, select when the workflow should be initiated:

    - **Manually** — Start this workflow manually.[^3]
    - **On Model Registration** — Start this workflow when a model is registered in your model inventory.[^4]
    - **On Model Field Change** — Start this workflow on a change to a specific model inventory field.[^5]

6. Under **[workflow expected duration]{.smallcaps}**, define the SLA for the workflow based on the start date in days, weeks, months, or years.

7. Click **Add Workflow** to save your blank workflow, and then [configure your workflow steps](#configure-workflow-steps).

### Configure workflow steps

To add or edit workflow steps:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Workspace, select **Workflows**.

3. Click on the workflow you'd like to modify, then:

    - To add a step, drag and drop a new step onto the canvas.
    - Double-click the new step to open up the configuration modal.

4. After you're finished with step configuration, click **Update Step** to apply your changes.

5. After you've configured a step, you can then [link your workflow together](/guide/model-workflows/configure-custom-workflows.qmd#link-workflow-together).

Refer to [Workflow step types](/guide/model-workflows/setting-up-model-workflows.qmd#workflow-step-types) for information on available step types and details on how to set up conditional requirements.

## Configure workflow steps*

{{< include _configure-workflow-steps.qmd >}}

### Add conditional requirements*

Conditional requirements can be configured for all four available step types:

| Step type | Conditional options |
|---:|---|
| Status Change | Under **[when these conditions are met]{.smallcaps}**, you are able to set both `AND` and `OR` conditions. |
| User Action | Under **[display action button when]{.smallcaps}**, you are able to set both `AND` and `OR` conditions.  |
| Approval | Under **[threshold]{.smallcaps}**, you are able to set the minimum percentage of approvers required for the resource to be approved. |
| Condition Branch | Under each branch's **[conditions]{.smallcaps}**, you're able to designate the `AND` and `OR` conditions that apply to that path. |
: Step type conditional options {.hover tbl-colwidths="[20,80]"}

For Status Change[^3], User Action[^4], and Condition Branch[^5] conditions, you're able to add a single independent **Rule** or a linked condition **Group**. These rules and groups can be nested if desired:

- Click **{{< fa plus >}} Rule** to add an independent rule.
- Click **{{< fa plus >}} Group** to add a linked group of rules that all must be true to qualify. 

## Link workflow together*

{{< include _link-workflow-steps.qmd >}}

#### Link approval steps*
Approval steps need to be subsequently linked to both a [Rejected]{.bubble .red .red-bg} and an [Approved]{.bubble .green .green-bg} Status Change step:

1. First, configure an **Approval** step.[^6]

2. Then, drag two **Status Change** steps onto the canvas:[^7]

    - Assign a `Rejected` status to one in the **Set Document Status** field.
    - Assign an `Approved` status to the other in the **Set Document Status** field.

3. Connect the **Approval** step to the [Rejected]{.bubble .red .red-bg} and [Approved]{.bubble .green .green-bg} **Status Change** steps with the red and green **{{< fa circle >}}** respectively by dragging from the colored **{{< fa circle >}}** to the top **{{< fa circle >}}** of the subsequent step.

## Delete workflow steps*

1. Hover over the step until the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** menu appears, then click on it.

2. Select **{{< fa gear >}} Delete**.

    On the confirmation dialogue that appears, select **OK** to confirm deletion.

3. When you are finished, click **Save Workflow** to apply your changes.

### Remove links between steps*

1. Hover over a connection until the **{{< fa circle-xmark >}}** appears.

2. Click **{{< fa circle-xmark >}}** to delete the connection.

    On the confirmation dialogue that appears, select **OK** to confirm deletion.

3. When you are finished, click **Save Workflow** to apply your changes.
