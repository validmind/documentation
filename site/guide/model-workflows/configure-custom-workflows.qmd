Configure workflows to match your organizational needs throughout your model lifecycles. Workflows can be as simple or as complex as required, with multiple and discrete workflows supported for unique triggers and scenarios.

## Create custom workflows

To set up a new custom workflow, you'll need to complete these three steps in sequence:

 1. Add a new workflow
 2. Configure the workflow steps
 3. Link the workflow together

### Add new workflows

{{< include _add-new-workflows.qmd >}}

### Configure workflow steps

{{< include _configure-workflow-steps.qmd >}}

### Link workflow together

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-40-ns .pr3}
[Start the workflow](#start-the-workflow){.button .button-fill}

:::

::: {.w-30-ns .pr3}
[Link steps together](#link-steps-together){.button .button-fill}

## Edit existing workflows

You can edit a workflow in two ways:

1. Via the **{{< fa gear >}} Settings** page:

    a. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.
    b. Under Workspace, select **Workflows**.
    c. Click on the workflow you'd like to modify to edit the configuration for that workflow.

2. Via a workflow applied to a model:

    a. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.
    b. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^3]
    c. On the landing page of your model, locate the [active workflows]{.smallcaps} section.
    d. Click on the name of the workflow you'd like to abort to open that specific workflow's details.
    e. On the workflow's detail modal, click on the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** in the top-right hand corner and select **{{< fa pencil >}} Edit Workflow**.

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Delete workflow steps

1. Hover over the step until the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** menu appears, then click on it.

2. Select **{{< fa gear >}} Delete**.

    On the confirmation dialogue that appears, select **OK** to confirm deletion.

3. When you are finished, click **Save Workflow** to apply your changes.

#### Remove links between steps
