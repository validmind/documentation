Configure workflows to match your organizational needs throughout your model lifecycles. Workflows can be as simple or as complex as required, with multiple and discrete workflows supported for unique triggers and scenarios.

To set up a workflow, you'll need to complete these two steps in sequence:

 1. [Configure the workflow steps](#configure-workflow-steps)
 2. [Link the workflow together](#link-workflow-together)

::: {.attn}

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] Model stages must be fully configured.[^1]
- [x] You are a [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^2] 

:::

## Configure workflow steps

{{< include _configure-workflow-steps.qmd >}}

### Add conditional requirements

Conditional requirements can be configured for all four available step types:

| Step type | Conditional options |
|---:|---|
| Status Change | Under **[when these conditions are met]{.smallcaps}**, you are able to set both `AND` and `OR` conditions. |
| User Action | Under **[display action button when]{.smallcaps}**, you are able to set both `AND` and `OR` conditions.  |
| Approval | Under **[threshold]{.smallcaps}**, you are able to set the minimum percentage of approvers required for the resource to be approved. |
| Condition Branch | Under each branch's **[conditions]{.smallcaps}**, you're able to designate the `AND` and `OR` conditions that apply to that path. |
: Step type conditional options {.hover tbl-colwidths="[20,80]"}

For Status Change[^3], User Action[^4], and Condition Branch[^5] conditions, you're able to add a single independent **Rule** or a linked condition **Group**. These rules and groups can be nested if desired:

- Click **{{< fa plus >}} Rule** to add an independent rule.
- Click **{{< fa plus >}} Group** to add a linked group of rules that all must be true to qualify. 

## Link workflow together

{{< include _link-workflow-steps.qmd >}}

#### Link approval steps
Approval steps need to be subsequently linked to both a [Rejected]{.bubble .red .red-bg} and an [Approved]{.bubble .green .green-bg} Status Change step:

1. First, configure an **Approval** step.[^6]

2. Then, drag two **Status Change** steps onto the canvas:[^7]

    - Assign a `Rejected` status to one in the **Set Document Status** field.
    - Assign an `Approved` status to the other in the **Set Document Status** field.

3. Connect the **Approval** step to the [Rejected]{.bubble .red .red-bg} and [Approved]{.bubble .green .green-bg} **Status Change** steps with the red and green **{{< fa circle >}}** respectively by dragging from the colored **{{< fa circle >}}** to the top **{{< fa circle >}}** of the subsequent step.

## Delete workflow steps

1. Hover over the step until the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** menu appears, then click on it.

2. Select **{{< fa gear >}} Delete**.

    On the confirmation dialogue that appears, select **OK** to confirm deletion.

3. When you are finished, click **Save Workflow** to apply your changes.

### Remove links between steps

1. Hover over a connection until the **{{< fa circle-xmark >}}** appears.

2. Click **{{< fa circle-xmark >}}** to delete the connection.

    On the confirmation dialogue that appears, select **OK** to confirm deletion.

3. When you are finished, click **Save Workflow** to apply your changes.
