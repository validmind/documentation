Workflows can be configured to match your organizational needs for overseeing model development, validation, or implementation activities.

To set up a workflow, you'll need to complete these two steps in sequence:

 1. [Configure the workflow steps](#configure-workflow-steps) 
 2. [Link the workflow together](#link-workflow-together)

::: {.attn}

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] Model lifecycle statuses must be fully configured.[^1]
- [x] You are a [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^2] 

:::


## Configure workflow steps

{{< include _configure-workflow-steps.qmd >}}

### Add conditional requirements

Conditional requirements can be configured for all four available step types:

| Step type | Conditional options |
|---:|---|
| Status Change | Under **[when these conditions are met]{.smallcaps}**, you are able to set both `AND` and `OR` conditions. |
| User Action | Under **[display action button when]{.smallcaps}**, you are able to set both `AND` and `OR` conditions.  |
| Approval | Under **[threshold]{.smallcaps}**, you are able to set the minimum percentage of approvers required for the resource to be approved. |
| Condition Branch | Under each branch's **[conditions]{.smallcaps}**, you're able to designate the `AND` and `OR` conditions that apply to that path. |
: Step type conditional options {.hover tbl-colwidths="[20,80]"}

For Status Change[^17], User Action[^18], and Condition Branch[^19] conditions, you're able to add a single independent **Rule** or a linked condition **Group**. These rules and groups can be nested if desired:

- Click **{{< fa plus >}} Rule** to add an independent rule.
- Click **{{< fa plus >}} Group** to add a linked group of rules that all must be true to qualify. 

## Link workflow together

{{< include _link-workflow-steps.qmd >}}

#### Link approval steps
Approval steps need to be subsequently linked to both a [Rejected]{.bubble .red .red-bg} and an [Approved]{.bubble .green .green-bg} Status Change step:

1. First, configure an **Approval** step.[^20]

2. Then, drag two **Status Change** steps onto the canvas:[^21]

    - Assign a `Rejected` status to one in the **Set Document Status** field.
    - Assign an `Approved` status to the other in the **Set Document Status** field.

3. Connect the **Approval** step to the [Rejected]{.bubble .red .red-bg} and [Approved]{.bubble .green .green-bg} **Status Change** steps with the red and green **{{< fa circle >}}** respectively by dragging from the colored **{{< fa circle >}}** to the top **{{< fa circle >}}** of the subsequent step.

## Delete workflow steps

1. Hover over the step until the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** menu appears, then click on it.

2. Select **{{< fa gear >}} Delete**.

    On the confirmation dialogue that appears, select **OK** to confirm deletion.

3. When you are finished, click **Save Workflow** to apply your changes.

### Remove links between steps

1. Hover over a connection until the **{{< fa circle-xmark >}}** appears.

2. Click **{{< fa circle-xmark >}}** to delete the connection.

    On the confirmation dialogue that appears, select **OK** to confirm deletion.

3. When you are finished, click **Save Workflow** to apply your changes.
