Configure workflows to match your organizational needs throughout your model lifecycles. Workflows can be as simple or as complex as required, with multiple and discrete workflows supported for unique triggers and scenarios.

::: {.attn}

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] Model stages must be fully configured.[^1]
- [x] You are a [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^2]

## Create a custom workflow

To set up a new custom workflow, you'll need to complete these three steps in sequence:

 1. [Add a new workflow](#add-workflows)
 2. [Configure the workflow steps](#configure-workflow-steps)
 3. [Link the workflow together](#link-workflow-together)

### Add new workflows

{{< include _add-new-workflows.qmd >}}

### Configure workflow steps

{{< include _configure-workflow-steps.qmd >}}

### Link workflow together

{{< include _link-workflow-together.qmd >}}

##### Link approval steps*
{{< fa users >}} Approval steps need to be subsequently linked to both a [Rejected]{.bubble .red .red-bg} and an [Approved]{.bubble .green .green-bg} {{< fa cube >}} Model Stage Change step:[^3]

1. First, configure an **{{< fa users >}} Approval** step.

2. Then, drag two **{{< fa cube >}} Model Stage Change** steps onto the canvas:

    - Assign a `Rejected` status to one in the **Set Document Status** field.
    - Assign an `Approved` status to the other in the **Set Document Status** field.

3. Connect the **{{< fa users >}} Approval** step to the [Rejected]{.bubble .red .red-bg} and [Approved]{.bubble .green .green-bg} **{{< fa cube >}} Model Stage Change** steps with the red and green **{{< fa circle >}}** respectively by dragging from the colored **{{< fa circle >}}** to the top **{{< fa circle >}}** of the subsequent step.

## Edit existing workflows

You can edit a workflow in two ways:

1. Via the **{{< fa gear >}} Settings** page:

    a. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.
    b. Under Workspace, select **Workflows**.
    c. Click on the workflow you'd like to modify to edit the configuration for that workflow.

2. Via a workflow applied to a model:

    a. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.
    b. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^4]
    c. On the landing page of your model, locate the [active workflows]{.smallcaps} section.
    d. Click on the name of the workflow you'd like to abort to open that specific workflow's details.
    e. On the workflow's detail modal, click on the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** in the top-right hand corner and select **{{< fa pencil >}} Edit Workflow**.

### Delete workflow steps

1. Hover over the step until the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** menu appears, then click on it.

2. Select **{{< fa gear >}} Delete**.

    On the confirmation dialogue that appears, select **OK** to confirm deletion.

3. When you are finished, click **Save Workflow** to apply your changes.

### Remove links between steps

1. Hover over a connection until the **{{< fa trash-can >}}** appears.

2. Click **{{< fa trash-can >}}** to delete the connection.

    On the confirmation dialogue that appears, select **OK** to confirm deletion.

3. When you are finished, click **Save Workflow** to apply your changes.
