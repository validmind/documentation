View the status of a model in a workflow, and transition models into the appropriate workflow states.

::: {.attn}

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] The model is registered in the model inventory.[^1]
- [x] Model stages have already been customized for use in workflows.[^2]
- [x] Workflows have already been set up for use with your models.[^3]
- [x] You are a assigned role with sufficient permissions to transition the workflow into its next state.[^4] 

:::

## See workflow states*

To review the overall workflow state for a model: 

{{< include _model-workflows-see.qmd >}}

## Transition workflow states*

::: {.callout-important title="Roles and action visibility"}
Depending on the configuration of your workflows, you may or may not be able to move a model into another workflow state as actions can be gated to only users of certain roles. 

When all the actions that can be performed by your role are completed for that model at that stage of the workflow, the Actions section will disappear from view. 
:::

To transition the overall workflow status for a model:

{{< include _model-workflows-transition.qmd >}}

### Reset your model workflow*

If you need to reset your model's workflow to the beginning: 

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^5]

3. Click on **[model status]{.smallcaps}**.

4. Select **Reset Workflow**.

    After you confirm, that model's workflow will be returned to its initial state.
