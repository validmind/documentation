Manage lifecycle processes within your {{< var validmind.platform >}} setup using workflows. Customize both your workflows and your lifecycle statuses to reflect the procedures within your organization. 

::: {.attn}

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] The model is registered in the model inventory.[^1]
- [x] Model lifecycle statuses have already been customized for use in workflows.[^2]
- [x] Workflows have already been set up for use with your models.[^3]
- [x] You are a [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^4] 

:::

## See workflow statuses

To review the overall workflow status for a model: 

{{< include _model-workflows-see.qmd >}}

## Transition workflow statuses

::: {.callout-important title="Roles and action visibility"}
Depending on the configuration of your workflows, you may or may not be able to move a model into another workflow state as actions can be gated to only users of certain roles. 

When all the actions that can be performed by your role are completed for that model at that stage of the workflow, the Actions section will disappear from view. 
:::

To transition the overall workflow status for a model:

{{< include _model-workflows-transition.qmd >}}

### Reset your model workflow

If you need to reset your model's workflow to the beginning: 

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^5]

3. Click on **[model status]{.smallcaps}**.

4. Select **Reset Workflow**.

    After you confirm, that model's workflow will be returned to its initial state.
