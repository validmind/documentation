Add or delete documents available on individual models in your inventory.

::: {.callout title="A standard model documentation, validation report, and ongoing monitoring report documents are provided by default."} 
These stock documents cannot be deleted, only edited.
:::

::: {.attn}

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] The model is registered in the model inventory.[^1]
- [x] Document types[^2] and document templates[^3] have been set up for use.
- [x] You are assigned a role with sufficient permissions to create or modify documents on models.[^4] 

:::

## Add model documents

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^5]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **{{< fa file >}} Documents** and select the **Latest** tab.[^6]

4. Click **{{< fa plus >}} Create Document**.

5. Enter in the document details:

    - **[document title]{.smallcaps}** — Title of your document.[^7]
    - **[document type]{.smallcaps}**[^8] — The type of your document.
    - **[document source]{.smallcaps}** — Upload a PDF file[^9] or select from an existing document template.[^10]

6. Click **Create Document** to add the document to your model.

#### Upload PDF documents

Convert a Portable Document Format `.pdf` file (PDF) into an editable document in the {{< var validmind.platform >}}, allowing you to seamlessly work with existing PDFs as you would with any other template-based document, such as adding content blocks and attaching test results.

{{< var vm.product >}} automatically extracts the structure and content from your PDF, generates a document template that maps to the extracted sections, and populates each section in the template with the contents from your original document.

::::::: {.panel-tabset}

##### Convert PDF to editable template

To upload a PDF and convert it into an editable model document:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **{{< fa file >}} Documents** and select the **Latest** tab.

4. Click on the document you want to add content to.

5. Under [start your document]{.smallcaps}, select **Upload PDF**.

6. Drag and drop your `.pdf` file into the upload area, or click **choose your file** to browse for it.

::: {.callout title="Only a single PDF file can be uploaded at a time."}
If you need to upload a different PDF, remove the current file first before selecting a new one.
:::

7. Click **Upload & Convert** to begin the conversion.

    A progress banner appears at the top of the document page indicating that conversion is in progress.

8. When the conversion completes, the page automatically refreshes to display your document as an editable template with the content extracted from the PDF.

##### Cancel PDF conversion

If you need to stop an in-progress conversion:

1. While the conversion progress banner is displayed, click **Cancel**.

2. In the confirmation dialog, optionally enable the toggle to also delete the uploaded PDF file.

3. Click **Cancel Conversion** to confirm.

    If you chose to keep the file, the PDF remains attached to the document as a static file. You can view the PDF but it will not be converted into an editable template.

##### Upload PDF as static document

To upload a PDF without converting it to an editable template:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **{{< fa file >}} Documents** and select the **Latest** tab.

4. Click **{{< fa plus >}} Create Document**.

5. Enter the document details and select **Upload PDF** as the document source.

6. Drag and drop your `.pdf` file into the upload area, or click **choose your file** to browse for it.

7. Click **Upload** to attach the PDF to the document.

    The PDF is stored as a static file. You can view it within {{< var validmind.platform >}} but you cannot edit its contents.

:::::

::: {.callout title="PDF conversion runs in the background."}
Depending on the size and complexity of your PDF, conversion can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. You can continue working in the {{< var validmind.platform >}} while the conversion runs.

::: {.callout collapse="true" appearance="minimal"}

### Best practices for PDF imports

For the best conversion results, keep the following in mind when preparing your PDF:

- **Use text-based PDFs.** PDFs that contain selectable text convert most reliably. Scanned image-only PDFs may produce poor or empty results.
- **Use clear heading hierarchy.** Documents with well-defined headings (H1, H2, H3) produce more accurate section mappings in the generated template.
- **Keep formatting simple.** Standard paragraphs, lists, and tables convert well. Complex layouts such as multi-column text, sidebars, or heavily nested tables may not be preserved accurately.
- **Check file size.** Large PDFs with many pages take longer to process. Consider splitting very large documents into smaller sections before uploading if conversion times are a concern.
- **Review after conversion.** Always review the generated template after conversion completes to verify that sections and content were extracted correctly.

## Examples of successful imports

The following types of PDF documents typically produce good conversion results:

- Model documentation reports with clearly labeled sections such as executive summary, methodology, data description, and results.
- Validation reports that follow a standard heading structure.
- Risk assessments and policy documents organized with numbered sections.
- Regulatory submissions with a table of contents and consistent formatting.

## Troubleshooting PDF import failures

If a PDF conversion fails or produces unexpected results, try the following:

| Issue | Possible cause | Resolution |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| Conversion fails immediately | The file may be corrupted or password-protected. | Verify the PDF opens correctly in a local PDF viewer. Remove any password protection before uploading. |
| Conversion completes but sections are empty | The PDF may contain scanned images instead of text. | Use OCR software to convert the scanned PDF to a text-based PDF before uploading. |
| Sections are mapped incorrectly | The PDF may lack consistent heading styles. | Review the PDF structure and ensure headings are formatted distinctly from body text. After conversion, manually adjust section content as needed. |
| Conversion takes too long | The PDF may be very large or contain complex elements. | Try uploading a simplified version of the PDF. Remove large embedded images or unnecessary appendices. |
| Conversion status shows [failed]{.bubble .bubble-red} | An unexpected error occurred during processing. | Re-upload the PDF file and try the conversion again. If the issue persists, contact your {{< var validmind.platform >}} administrator. |

::: {.callout-important title="You can cancel a stuck conversion at any time."}
If a conversion appears to be stuck, use the **Cancel** option on the progress banner to stop processing and try again with a revised PDF.

## Edit model documents

::: {.callout title="Static PDF documents cannot be edited."}
PDFs that were uploaded without conversion are considered static documents. To edit a PDF-sourced document, upload it with the **Upload & Convert** option to generate an editable template. Documents generated by the {{< var validmind.developer >}} or created in the {{< var validmind.platform >}} can also be edited.
:::

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^11]

3.  In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **{{< fa file >}} Documents** and select the **Latest** tab.[^12]

4. Click on the document file you'd like to edit.

5. Jump to any section of the document by clicking on a heading you would like to view.

6. In any section of the document, click to add or edit content.[^13]

    Use the text editor functions to edit the content of the section.

## Delete model documents

::: {.callout-important}
Deletion of documents on models is permanent and cannot be undone.
:::

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^14]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **{{< fa file >}} Documents** and select the **Latest** tab.[^15]

4. Hover over the document you want to delete.

5. When the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** appears, click on it and select [**{{< fa trash-can >}} Delete**]{.red} to remove the document.

6. After you confirm, the document type will be deleted from the model.
