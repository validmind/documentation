Add or delete documents available on individual models in your inventory.

::: {.callout title="A standard model documentation, validation report, and ongoing monitoring report documents are provided by default."}
These stock documents cannot be deleted, only edited.
:::

::: {.attn}

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] The model is registered in the model inventory.[^1]
- [x] Document types[^2] and document templates[^3] have been set up for use.
- [x] You are assigned a role with sufficient permissions to create or modify documents on models.[^4]

:::

## Add model documents

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^5]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **{{< fa file >}} Documents** and select the **Latest** tab.[^6]

4. Click **{{< fa plus >}} Create Document**.

5. Enter in the document details:

    - **[document title]{.smallcaps}** — Title of your document.[^7]
    - **[document type]{.smallcaps}**[^8] — The type of your document.

6. Click **Create Document** to select from an existing document template,[^9] or upload an existing PDF.[^10]

#### Upload PDF documents

Convert a Portable Document Format `.pdf` file (PDF) into an editable document in the {{< var validmind.platform >}}, allowing you to seamlessly work with existing PDFs as you would with any other template-based document, such as adding content blocks and attaching test results.

{{< var vm.product >}} automatically extracts the structure and content from your PDF, generates a document template that maps to the extracted sections, and populates each section in the template with the contents from your original document.[^11]

::::::: {.panel-tabset}

##### Convert PDF to editable document

To upload a PDF and convert it into an editable document:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^12]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **{{< fa file >}} Documents** and select the **Latest** tab.[^13]

4. Click on an empty document you want to upload a PDF to,[^14] or create a new document.[^15]

5. Under [create document]{.smallcaps}, select **From PDF Upload**.

6. Drag and drop a `.pdf` file into the upload area, or click **choose a file** to select from your file explorer.[^16]

7. Click **Upload & Convert to Editable Document**.

    Track conversion progress in the banner that appears at the top of the document page.

When conversion completes, the page automatically refreshes to display your document as an editable template with the content extracted from the PDF.

##### Cancel PDF conversion

If you need to stop an in-progress PDF conversion:

1. In the conversion progress banner that appears at the top of the document page, click **Cancel**.

2. On the Cancel File Conversion modal, optionally toggle **Delete file from this document** on to also remove the uploaded PDF file.[^17]

3. Click **Cancel Conversion** to confirm.

##### Upload PDF as static document

To upload a PDF without converting it to an editable document:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^18]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **{{< fa file >}} Documents** and select the **Latest** tab.[^19]

4. Click on an empty document you want to upload a PDF to,[^20] or create a new document.[^21]

5. Under [create document]{.smallcaps}, select **From PDF Upload**.

6. Drag and drop a `.pdf` file into the upload area, or click **choose a file** to select from your file explorer.[^22]

7. Click **Upload as Static Document**.

The uploaded PDF is stored as a static file. You can view it within {{< var validmind.platform >}} but you cannot modify its structure or contents.

### How do I get the best results when converting PDFs into editable documents?

- **Use text-based PDFs** — PDFs that contain selectable text convert most reliably. Scanned image-only PDFs may produce poor or empty results.
- **Use clear heading hierarchy** — Documents with well-defined headings (H1, H2, H3) produce more accurate section mappings in the generated document template.
- **Keep formatting simple** — Standard paragraphs, lists, and tables convert well. Complex layouts such as multi-column text, sidebars, or heavily nested tables may not be preserved accurately.

::: {.embed-tip}
### How can I trust that the conversion is accurate?

Always review the generated template after conversion completes to verify that sections and content were extracted correctly, and make any necessary adjustments.

## Troubleshooting

If a PDF conversion fails or produces unexpected results, try the following:

Conversion fails immediately
: - The file may be corrupted or password-protected.
- Verify the PDF opens correctly in a local PDF viewer. Remove any password protection before uploading.

Conversion completes but sections are empty
: - The PDF may contain scanned images instead of text.
- Use OCR software to convert the scanned PDF to a text-based PDF before uploading.

Sections are mapped incorrectly
: - The PDF may lack consistent heading styles.
- Review the PDF structure and ensure headings are formatted distinctly from body text. After conversion, manually adjust section content as needed.

Conversion takes too long
: - The PDF may be very large or contain complex elements.
- Try uploading a simplified version of the PDF. Remove large embedded images or unnecessary appendices.

Upload completes but conversion fails
: - An unexpected error occurred during processing.
- Re-upload the PDF file and try the conversion again. If the issue persists, contact your {{< var validmind.platform >}} administrator.

### My PDF conversion is stuck. What can I do?

If a conversion appears to be stuck, click **Cancel** in the conversion progress banner to stop processing and try again with a revised PDF.
