### Add existing text blocks to library

To transform an existing text block into a reusable block:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^2]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **{{< fa file >}} Documents** and select a document file.[^3]

4. Select the relevant section containing the text block you want to make reusable.

4. Hover your mouse over the text block you want to add to your block library, and click **{{< fa plus >}} Add to Library** to enter the details for your block:

    - The **[name]{.smallcaps}** of your text block
    - (Optional) A **[description]{.smallcaps}** for your text block
    - The templated **[content]{.smallcaps}** for your text block
    - Whether the block **[sharing]{.smallcaps}** permissions are **Private** or **Shared**

5. Click **Add Block** to save your text block.

After you've added a reusable text block, you can then insert it into your model documents.[^4]
