Filtering supports simple and complex conditions using AND or OR logic with nested groups. You can filter on both the default fields created by {{< var vm.product >}} and custom fields created by your organization.

**TO DO How to get to the filter modal**

Validation issues:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Validation Issues** to view a list of validation issues across all models.

2. Click **{{< fa filter >}} Filter**.

Model inventory:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Click **{{< fa filter >}} Filter**.

## Step 1: Add a rule

    A filter rule contains three components:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%" .pl4 .pr3}
Field selector
: Dropdown to choose the field to filter by

Operator selector
: Dropdown to select the comparison operator

Value editor
: Input area that varies based on the selected field type
:::

::: {.column width="50%" .pl3}

5. Add more rules

Click **{{< fa plus >}} Rule** again to add additional conditions. By default, multiple rules are combined with **AND** logic (all conditions must match).

## Step 2: Create groups

Groups combine multiple rules that are evaluated together and allow for more complex logic. To add groups:

Groups enable **OR** logic, allowing queries like "Show items matching (condition A AND condition B) OR (condition C)". Groups can be nested multiple levels deep.

1. Click **Add group** to create a nested group of conditions. 

## Step 3: Change combinators

Click the **AND** or **OR** button between rules or groups to change how conditions are combined:

   - **AND**: All conditions must match
   - **OR**: At least one condition must match

## Examples

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Simple AND query

Show models that are Active AND in the Credit Risk business unit:

1. Add rule: Field = "Status", Operator = "equals", Value = "Active".

2. Add rule: Field = "Business Unit", Operator = "equals", Value = "Credit Risk".

3. Click **Apply Filters**.

### OR query with groups

Show models that are (Active AND in Credit Risk) OR (In Review AND in Market Risk):

1. Add rule: Field = "Status", Operator = "equals", Value = "Active".

2. Add rule: Field = "Business Unit", Operator = "equals", Value = "Credit Risk".

3. Click **Add group** to create a new group.

4. Change combinator to "OR" (between the two groups).

5. In the new group, add: Status = "In Review", Business Unit = "Market Risk".

6. Click **Apply Filters**.

### Custom field filter

Show models where Custom Field 'Risk Level' is 'High':

1. Add rule: Field = "Custom Fields > Risk Level", Operator = "equals", Value = "High".

2. Click **Apply Filters**.

### Complex nested query

Show models where (Status is Active OR In Review) AND (Risk Level is High OR Medium) AND Owner is John Doe:

1. Create first group: Status = "Active" OR Status = "In Review".

2. Create second group: Risk Level = "High" OR Risk Level = "Medium".

3. Add rule: Owner = "John Doe".

4. Ensure all groups use AND combinator.

5. Click **Apply Filters**.

### Date range filter

Show findings created between January 1, 2025 and January 31, 2025:

1. Add rule: Field = "Created Date", Operator = "between".

2. Enter start date: January 1, 2025.

3. Enter end date: January 31, 2025.

4. Click **Apply Filters**.

### Filter by owner and PDF attachments

Show models owned by a specific user that have attachments with "pdf" in the file name:

1. Add rule: Field = "Owner", Operator = "in", Value = [Select user from dropdown].

2. Add rule: Field = "Supporting Documents", Operator = "file name contains", Value = "pdf".

3. Ensure the combinator between rules is set to "AND".

4. Click **Apply Filters**.

### View and manage active filters

After applying filters, active filter conditions appear as individual chips below the page header with the label "Filtered by:". Each chip displays:

- Field name (human-readable)
- Operator (if applicable)
- Value(s) (formatted for display)
- Remove button ({{< fa xmark >}} icon)

### Remove individual filters

1. Click the {{< fa xmark >}} button on any filter chip to remove that specific filter condition.

2. 

The remaining filters are automatically reapplied. If removing a filter leaves no filters, all filters are cleared.
