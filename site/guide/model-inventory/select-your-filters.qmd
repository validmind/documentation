Filtering supports simple and complex conditions using AND or OR logic with nested groups. You can filter on both the default fields created by {{< var vm.product >}} and custom fields created by your organization.

## Step 1: Add a rule

1. Click **{{< fa plus >}} Rule** to add a filter condition. 

    A new filter row appears with three components:

    - **Field selector**: Dropdown to choose the field to filter by
    - **Operator selector**: Dropdown to select the comparison operator
    - **Value editor**: Input area that varies based on the selected field type

2. From the field selector dropdown, select one of:

    - **Core fields** — The default fields, such as Business Unit or Model Stage
    - **Stakeholders or assignees** — The owner, developer, or validator, if applicable
    - **Custom fields** — The organization-specific fields you added

3. From the operator selector dropdown, select one of:


    - **Text fields** — equals, not equals, contains, begins with, ends with, is empty, is not empty
    - **Number fields** — equals, not equals, greater than, less than, between, is empty, is not empty
    - **Date fields** — equals, not equals, before, after, between, is empty, is not empty
    - **Boolean fields** — equals, not equals, is empty, is not empty
    - **Multi-select fields** — in, not in, contains, is empty, is not empty

    The available operators automatically update based on the selected field type.

4. From the value editor, enter or select a value based on the field type:

   - **Text** — Text input or text area  longer content
   - **Number** — Number input or range slider
   - **Date** — Date picker
   - **Boolean** — Checkbox
   - **Select/multi-select** — Dropdown with search
   - **Entity fields (users, models)** — Dropdown with search and loading states

5. Add more rules

Click **{{< fa plus >}} Rule** again to add additional conditions. By default, multiple rules are combined with **AND** logic (all conditions must match).

## Step 2: Create groups

Groups enable **OR** logic, allowing queries like "Show items matching (condition A AND condition B) OR (condition C)". Groups can be nested multiple levels deep.

1. Click **Add group** to create a nested group of conditions. 

## Step 3: Change combinators

Click the **AND** or **OR** button between rules or groups to change how conditions are combined:

   - **AND**: All conditions must match
   - **OR**: At least one condition must match

## Examples

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Simple AND query

Show models that are Active AND in the Credit Risk business unit:

1. Add rule: Field = "Status", Operator = "equals", Value = "Active"
2. Add rule: Field = "Business Unit", Operator = "equals", Value = "Credit Risk"
3. Click **Apply Filters**

### OR query with groups

Show models that are (Active AND in Credit Risk) OR (In Review AND in Market Risk):

1. Add rule: Field = "Status", Operator = "equals", Value = "Active"
2. Add rule: Field = "Business Unit", Operator = "equals", Value = "Credit Risk"
3. Click **Add group** to create a new group
4. Change combinator to "OR" (between the two groups)
5. In the new group, add: Status = "In Review", Business Unit = "Market Risk"
6. Click **Apply Filters**

### Custom field filter

Show models where Custom Field 'Risk Level' is 'High':

1. Add rule: Field = "Custom Fields > Risk Level", Operator = "equals", Value = "High"
2. Click **Apply Filters**

### Complex nested query

Show models where (Status is Active OR In Review) AND (Risk Level is High OR Medium) AND Owner is John Doe:

1. Create first group: Status = "Active" OR Status = "In Review"
2. Create second group: Risk Level = "High" OR Risk Level = "Medium"
3. Add rule: Owner = "John Doe"
4. Ensure all groups use AND combinator
5. Click **Apply Filters**

### Date range filter

Show findings created between January 1, 2025 and January 31, 2025:

1. Add rule: Field = "Created Date", Operator = "between"
2. Enter start date: January 1, 2025
3. Enter end date: January 31, 2025
4. Click **Apply Filters**

### Filter by owner and PDF attachments

Show models owned by a specific user that have attachments with "pdf" in the file name:

1. Add rule: Field = "Owner", Operator = "in", Value = [Select user from dropdown]
2. Add rule: Field = "Supporting Documents", Operator = "file name contains", Value = "pdf"
3. Ensure the combinator between rules is set to "AND"
4. Click **Apply Filters**

### View and manage active filters

After applying filters, active filter conditions appear as individual chips below the page header with the label "Filtered by:". Each chip displays:

- Field name (human-readable)
- Operator (if applicable)
- Value(s) (formatted for display)
- Remove button ({{< fa xmark >}} icon)

### Remove individual filters

- Click the {{< fa xmark >}} button on any filter chip to remove that specific filter condition.
- The remaining filters are automatically reapplied.
- If removing a filter leaves no filters, all filters are cleared.
