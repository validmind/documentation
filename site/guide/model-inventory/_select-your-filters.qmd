Filtering supports simple and complex conditions using AND or OR logic with nested groups. You can filter on both the default fields created by {{< var vm.product >}} and custom fields created by your organization.

## Rules

Rules define individual conditions to filter by, such as the business unit or owner. 

To add a rule:

1. Click **{{< fa plus >}} Rule** to add a filter condition. 
   
    A filter rule contains three components:

    ![](/guide/model-inventory/select-your-filters-rule.png){width="90%" fig-alt="A new filter row with three components" .screenshot}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%" .pl4 .pr2}
Field selector
: Dropdown to choose the field type to filter by.
:::

::: {.column width="30%" .pl4 .pr3}
Operator selector
: Dropdown to select the comparison operator.
:::

::: {.column width="30%" .pl3}
Value editor
: Input area that varies based on the selected field type.
:::

::::

2. From the field selector dropdown, select one of:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%" .pl4 .pr2}
**Default fields**  
One of the fields always created by {{< var vm.product >}}.
:::

::: {.column width="30%" .pl4 .pr3}
**Stakeholders or assignees**  
Owner, Developer, or Validator, if applicable.
:::

::: {.column width="30%" .pl3}
**Custom fields**  
One of the organization-specific fields you added for your own use.
:::

::::

3. From the operator dropdown, select one of:<br><small>_Available operators update based on the field selector._</small>

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%" .pl4 .pr2}
Text fields
: - equals
- not equals
- contains
- begins with
- ends with
- is empty
- is not empty
</small>

Date fields
: - equals
- not equals
- before
- after
- between
- is empty
- is not empty
:::

::: {.column width="30%" .pl4 .pr3}
Number fields
: - equals

- greater than
- less than
- between
- is empty
- is not empty

Boolean fields
: - equals
- not equals
- is empty
- is not empty
:::

::: {.column width="30%" .pl3}
Multi-select fields
: - in
- not in
- contains
- is empty
- is not empty
:::

::::

4. From the value editor, enter or select a value based on the field type:<br><small>_Value input changes based on field selector._</small>

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%" .pl4 .pr2}
Text
: Text input or text area for longer content

Date
: Date picker
:::

::: {.column width="30%" .pl4 .pr3}
Number
: Number input or range slider

Boolean
: Checkbox
:::

::: {.column width="30%" .pl3}
Select/multi-select
: Dropdown with search

Entity fields
: Dropdown with search for users or models
:::

5. Optional: Add more rules by following the same steps.

6. Click **Apply Filters**.

## Groups

Groups combine multiple rules that are evaluated together and can be nested one level deep. You use groups for more complex queries, such as: 

::: {.pl4 .pr4 .tc}
_Condition A AND (Condition B OR Condition C)<br><small>Example: Use case is Attrition/Churn Management AND (Business Unit is Commerical Banking OR Business Unit is Retail Banking)</small>_

![](/guide/model-inventory/select-your-filters-group.png){fig-alt="A rule AND a group of OR rules" .screenshot}
:::

To add a group:

1. Click **Add group** to create a nested group of conditions.

2. Follow the same steps as in [**Rules**](#rules) to add one or several conditions to the group.

3. Click **Apply Filters**.

## Combinators

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%" .pr3}

Combinators define how multiple rules or groups are logically combined when matching conditions. By default, multiple rules are combined with **AND** logic, meaning all conditions must match. 

Supported combinators:

- **AND**: All conditions must match

- **OR**: At least one condition must match

To change the combinator:

1. Click the **AND** or **OR** button between rules or groups to change how conditions are combined.

2. Click **Apply Filters**.
:::

::: {.column width="30%" .pl3}
![](/guide/model-inventory/select-your-filters-combinators.png){fig-alt="The AND and OR combinators" .screenshot}
:::

::::


::: {.callout title="Why can't I AND and OR top-level combinators?"}
Combinators must evaluate logically for the filter to be applied. You cannot apply conflicting logic at the top-level, such as: 

_Show items matching condition A AND condition B OR condition C_. 

{{< fa hand-point-right >}} **To achive more complex queries, use groups.**

## Examples

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Simple AND query

Show models that are Active AND in the Credit Risk business unit:

1. Add rule: Field = `Status`, Operator = `equals`, Value = `Active`.

2. Add rule: Field = `Business Unit`, Operator = `equals`, Value = `Credit Risk`.

3. Click **Apply Filters**.

### OR query with groups

Show models that are (Active AND in Credit Risk) OR (In Review AND in Market Risk):

1. Add rule: Field = `Status`, Operator = `equals`, Value = `Active`.

2. Add rule: Field = `Business Unit`, Operator = `equals`, Value = `Credit Risk`.

3. Click **Add group** to create a new group.

4. Change combinator to `OR` (between the two groups).

5. In the new group, add: Status = `In Review`, Business Unit = `Market Risk`.

6. Click **Apply Filters**.

### Custom field filter

Show models where Custom Field `Risk Level` is `High`:

1. Add rule: Field = `Custom Fields > Risk Level`, Operator = `equals`, Value = `High`.

2. Click **Apply Filters**.

### Complex nested query

Show models where (Status is Active OR In Review) AND (Risk Level is High OR Medium) AND Owner is John Doe:

1. Create first group: Status = `Active` OR Status = `In Review`.

2. Create second group: Risk Level = `High` OR Risk Level = `Medium`.

3. Add rule: Owner = `John Doe`.

4. Ensure all groups use AND combinator.

5. Click **Apply Filters**.

### Date range filter

Show findings created between January 1, 2025 and January 31, 2025:

1. Add rule: Field = `Created Date`, Operator = `between`.

2. Enter start date: January 1, 2025.

3. Enter end date: January 31, 2025.

4. Click **Apply Filters**.

### Filter by owner and PDF attachments

Show models owned by a specific user that have attachments with `pdf` in the file name:

1. Add rule: Field = `Owner`, Operator = `in`, Value = [Select user from dropdown].

2. Add rule: Field = `Supporting Documents`, Operator = `file name contains`, Value = `pdf`.

3. Ensure the combinator between rules is set to `AND`.

4. Click **Apply Filters**.

:::

### View and manage active filters

After applying filters, active filter conditions appear as individual chips below the page header with the label "Filtered by:". Each chip displays:

- Field name (human-readable)
- Operator (if applicable)
- Value(s) (formatted for display)
- Remove button ({{< fa xmark >}} icon)

### Remove individual filters

1. Click the {{< fa xmark >}} button on any filter chip to remove that specific filter condition.

2. 

The remaining filters are automatically reapplied. If removing a filter leaves no filters, all filters are cleared.
