Archive models within the model inventory when they are decommissioned or delete models that you no longer require records of, keeping your inventory accurate and up to date with your organization's current resources.

::: {.callout}
## By default, only the Customer Admin role[^1] can access archived models.

- Archived models are read-only, and do not contribute to sub-data, statistics or reports. 
- Findings from archived models will not be displayed, and reports will not include data from archived models.

## Change model stage

The model inventory within the {{< var validmind.platform >}} should reflect the state of models within your organization: 

- If you decomission a model, you can archive it within the model inventory. 
- Conversely, if there is a renewed business need for a model that has been archived, you can activate it again.

To change a model's stage:

1. In the left sidebar, click **Model Inventory**. 

2. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^4]

3. Click on the [model stage]{.smallcaps} section.

4. You can then select the appropriate stage for the model.

#### Archive models

1. Select **Archived** from the [model stage]{.smallcaps} drop-down menu.

2. Click **Save** to proceed with archival.

    - Once you confirm, the model is flagged as archived in the model inventory.
    - You can then also proceed with deleting your model if desired.[^5]

#### Activate models

1. Select **Active** from the [model stage]{.smallcaps} drop-down menu.

2. Click **Save** to proceed with activation.

    Once you confirm, the model is set to active in the model inventory. 

## Delete models

If a model was created in error, or you otherwise no longer require a model to be tracked in the model inventory, you can delete it.

::: {.callout-important title="Models must be inactive and archived before they can be deleted."}
Model deletion is also permanent and cannot be undone.
:::

1. In the left sidebar, click **Model Inventory**. 

2. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^5]

3. First, archive your model.[^6]

4. Then, under the [model stage]{.smallcaps} section, select **Deleted**.

    Once you confirm deletion, the model is removed from the model inventory.
