Use the audit trail functionality in the {{< var validmind.platform >}} to track or audit all the information events associated with a specific model. See a record of comments, workflow status changes, and updates made to the model.

{{< include _view-model-activity-overview.qmd >}}

{{< include _view-model-activity-steps.qmd >}}

### Filter activity

Use the **{{< fa filter >}} Filter** button to narrow down activity by category or specific values.

1. Click **{{< fa filter >}} Filter** to open the filter popover.

2. Click **{{< fa plus >}} Add Rule** to add a filter condition.

3. From the dropdown, select a filter option:

   Event Category
   : Shows _all events_ in a category. For example, selecting **Artifacts: Validation Issue** shows all validation issue events. Options include artifact types (such as Artifacts: Validation Issue, Artifacts: Policy Exception, or Artifacts: Model Limitation), Model Documents, Model Inventory Fields, Model Lifecycle, Model Metrics, Model Stakeholders, and Workflows.

   Filter by Value
   : Shows events for _specific items you select_. Pick a category, then choose one or more specific items from the second dropdown. For example, choose a particular validation issue, workflow, or custom field. 

4. (Optional) Add more rules by repeating the previous steps. Multiple rules combine with AND logic — for example, filter by a category and a specific user to see only that user's activity in that category.

5. Click **Apply Filters**.

### View active filters

After applying filters, active conditions appear as chips below the header. Click {{< fa xmark >}} on any chip to remove that filter, or click **Clear All Filters** to reset.

### Share filtered views

Filters persist in the URL, so you can share or bookmark a filtered view.
