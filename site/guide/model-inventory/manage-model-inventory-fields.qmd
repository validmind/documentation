## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] You are a [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^1]

:::

## View, search, and filter inventory fields

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Models, select **Model Inventory Fields**.

    Displayed in groups[^2] as lists are the inventory fields available to models in your organization with a quick view of:[^3]

    - Number of workflows that field is used in[^4]
    - The field key
    - The field type[^5]
    - Field description
    - Whether or not the field is required when creating models
    - Quick actions you can take on the inventory field

3. Narrow down existing inventory fields available to your models by searching or filtering for results:

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Search fields

a. Click **{{< fa magnifying-glass >}} Search** to search by keywords within an inventory field.

b. Select whether to search in the **Title** or **Description**.

c. Click **Search** to narrow down your results by your entered keywords.

    Expand any inventory field group to see more fields.

#### Filter fields

a. Click **{{< fa filter >}} Filter** to filter fields by any of the following criteria:

    - **[required on creation]{.smallcaps}** — Whether or not the field was set up as required on model registration.
    - **[types]{.smallcaps}** — What type of field it is.
    - **[workflow triggered by field]{.smallcaps}** — What workflows are initiated when this field is edited.[^6]
    - **[write permissions]{.smallcaps}** — Which model stakeholder types have permissions to edit this field.[^7]

b. Click **Apply Filters** to narrow down your results by your configured criteria.

    Expand any inventory field group to see more fields.

:::

::: {.callout title="Note that searching and filtering of fields stack."}
For example, if you first search by keyword for `date` under **Title** without clearing that search, any additional filters applied will only apply to the results returned by that initial search.
:::

## Add or edit inventory fields
<span id="add-edit"></span>

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Models, select **Model Inventory Fields**.

    Here you can edit existing inventory fields, or add a new one:

{{< include /guide/model-inventory/_add-edit-inventory-fields.qmd >}}

#### Inventory field types

{{< include /guide/model-inventory/_field-types.qmd >}}

::: {.callout title="Stick to basic operations."}
Keep your code simple and avoid complex logic and imports.
:::

For example, say you have numeric model inventory fields of `materiality` and `complexity`, where a larger value indicates a lower risk: 

![Adding a calculation type field](calculation-field.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing the screen for adding a calculation type field" width=90% .screenshot}

::: {.column-margin}
```python
    def formula(params):
        # High Risk: If materiality is high risk, return high risk regardless of complexity
        if params.materiality == "High Risk":
                return "High Risk"
        # Medium Risk: If materiality is low risk but complexity is high risk, return medium risk
        if params.materiality == "Low Risk" and params.complexity  == "High Risk":
                return "Medium Risk"
        # Low Risk: Both materiality and complexity are low risk
        return "Low Risk"
```
:::

## Add inventory field groups

To group model inventory fields, first create an inventory field group:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Models, select **Model Inventory Fields**.

3. Click **{{< fa plus >}} Add Group** and enter in a **[name]{.smallcaps}** and a **[description]{.smallcaps}** for the group.

4. Click **Create Group** to add the new group.

5. Assign the desired fields to the group.[^8]

## Delete inventory fields

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Models, select **Model Inventory Fields**.

3. Hover over the field you would like to delete.

4. When the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** appears under the Actions column, click on it and select [**{{< fa trash-can >}} Delete Field**]{.red}.

5. After you confirm, the field will be removed.
