## Add or edit inventory fields

    - To edit an existing field, select **{{< fa pencil >}} Edit** under the Actions column for the desired field.

3. Fields require a [type]{.smallcaps},[^2] a [name]{.smallcaps}, and a [description]{.smallcaps}.

    - You can also choose to indicate that a field is **[required on registration]{.smallcaps}**.
    - You can also assign **[write permissions]{.smallcaps}** to allow granular access to editing this field gated by model stakeholder types.[^3]

4. When you are satisfied with the setup of your field, click **Save**.

Calculation <span id="calculation"></span> 
: Define a `formula(params)` function that automatically calculates and returns a value based on the params dictionary, which includes selected custom field keys retrieved from your other inventory model fields.

    1. Click **{{< fa plus >}}** in front of the inventory field to allow your formula access to the field's values.
    2. Replace the demonstration formula with your own in the code box provided.
    3. Enter in sample values in the testing area then click **{{< fa play >}} Test Formula** to validate your formula.

::: {.callout title="Stick to basic operations."}
Keep your code simple and avoid complex logic and imports.
:::

For example, say you have numeric model inventory fields of `materiality` and `complexity`, where a larger value indicates a lower risk: 

![Adding a calculation type field](calculation-field.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing the screen for adding a calculation type field" width=90% .screenshot}

::: {.column-margin}
```python
    def formula(params):
        # High Risk: If materiality is high risk, return high risk regardless of complexity
        if params.materiality == "High Risk":
                return "High Risk"
        # Medium Risk: If materiality is low risk but complexity is high risk, return medium risk
        if params.materiality == "Low Risk" and params.complexity  == "High Risk":
                return "Medium Risk"
        # Low Risk: Both materiality and complexity are low risk
        return "Low Risk"
```
