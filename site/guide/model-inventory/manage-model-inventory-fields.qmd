## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] You are a [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^1]

## View, search, and filter inventory fields

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Models, select **Model Inventory Fields**.

    Displayed in groups as lists are the fields available to your organization with a quick view of:

    - Number of workflows that field is used in[^2]
    - The field key
    - The field type[^3]
    - Field description
    - Whether or not the field is required when creating models

3. Narrow down existing inventory fields available to your models by searching or filtering for results:

::: {.column-margin}

::: {.callout title="Note that searching and filtering of fields stack."}
For example, if you first search by keyword for `date` under **Title** without clearing that search, any additional filters applied will only apply to the results returned by that initial search.
