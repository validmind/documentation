Use the model inventory within the {{< var vm_platform >}} to easily track comprehensive details for all your models throughout the model lifecycle. The model inventory is customizable and extensible, and can be configured to suit your unique needs.

## Prerequisites
There are models registered in the model inventory[^1].

## Search, filter, and sort models
1. Log in to the {{< var vm_login >}}.

2. Click **Model Inventory** in the left sidebar. 

3. Use the top buttons to organize the model inventory to your preference:
   - Search for models using **{{< fa magnifying-glass >}} Search**. 
   - Use **{{< fa filter >}} Filter** to filter models by business units, developers, model tiering, model status, owners, use, validators, or vendor model.
   - Use **{{< fa arrow-up-wide-short >}} Sort** to sort results by certain criteria.
