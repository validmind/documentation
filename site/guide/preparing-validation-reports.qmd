As part of preparing validation reports, you can view the guidelines, collaborate with model developers, add or edit content to your draft validation report, link to evidence, or work with project findings.

## Prerequisites

- You hold the `Validator` role 
- The model you are documenting is registered in the model inventory
- A model developer has marked their model documentation as **Ready for Validation**

## Get started

1. {{< var vm_login >}}

2. In the left sidebar, click [**Model Inventory**]({{< var vm_url >}}/model-inventory).

3. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.

4. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Validation Report**.

   You can now jump to any section of the validation report by expanding the table of contents on the left and selecting the relevant section you would like to view.

5. In any section of the documentation, hover over text content and click the {{< fa edit >}} edit icon that appears on the right of the textbox. 

     You can now use the text editor functions to edit the content of the section. Whenever you make a change, an activity log entry is recorded under **Section activity** on the page, just below the section you are editing. 

6. Save your edits:

   a. Clicking on the {{< fa clock-rotate-left >}} icon in the editor toolbar.
   b. Select **Save current revision** and enter a name.
   c. Click {{< fa check >}} to save the revision.
