Learn how to access our introductory Jupyter notebook with the ValidMind Docker image.

## Prerequisites

You must have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed on your machine. 

## Steps

1. From the command line, pull the latest ValidMind Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker pull validmind/validmind-jupyter-demo:latest
   ```

2. Run the ValidMind Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker run -it -p 8888:8888 validmind/validmind-jupyter-demo
   ```

   After the command completes, you should see a message that Jupyter Server is running similar to this: 

   ```bash
   [I 2023-05-18 21:53:06.030 ServerApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /app
       1 active kernel
       Jupyter Server 2.5.0 is running at:
       http://032c824982aa:8888/lab?token=89e415261acba66a0f897c0d06ffdacfff9340553e65a626
           http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=89e415261acba66a0f897c0d06ffdacfff9340553e65a626
   ```

3. Copy the browser URL that starts with `http://127.0.0.1:8888` from the message and paste it into a new browser tab.

   After JupyterLab opens in your browser, you should see a link for our `Quickstart_Customer Churn_full_suite.ipynb` notebook.

4. Double click the notebook to open it:
