This section introduces you to the ValidMind Developer Framework and its functionalities. This topic is relevant for model developers who want to learn how to use the framework to document and test their models.

## What is the Developer Framework?

ValidMind's Developer Framework provides a rich suite of documentation tools and test plans, from documenting descriptions of your dataset to validation testing your models for weak spots and overfit areas. The Developer Framework helps you automate the generation of model documentation by uploading documentation artifacts and test results to the ValidMind platform. 

<!--- TO DO update this diagram to include documentation generation and testing --->

![](get-started-validmind.png){width=70% fig-align="left" fig-alt="An image showing the two main components of ValidMind. The Developer Framework that integrates with your existing developer environment, and the ValidMind MRM platform."}

ValidMind offers two primary methods for documenting model risk:

- **By generating model documentation**: Through automation, the framework extracts metadata from associated datasets and models for you and generates model documentation. You can also add more documentation and tests manually using the documentation editing capabilities in the ValidMind UI.
- **By running pre-built validation tests**: The framework provides a suite of validation tests for common financial services use cases. For cases where these tests do not cover everything you need, you can also extend existing test suites with your own proprietary tests or testing providers. 

The Developer Framework is designed to be model agnostic. If your model is built in Python, ValidMind’s Python client library  already provides all the standard functionality you might need without requiring your developers to rewrite any functions. For Python developers, a simple install gets you all of the functions:

```bash
pip install validmind
```

## How do I use the framework?

The workflow for model developers takes you through four major steps:

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[Develop<br>model] --> B[Generate model<br>documentation]
    B --> C[Refine model<br>documentation]
    C --> D[Submit for review]
    C --> B
```
<br>

**Develop model**
: In your existing developer environment, build one or more candidate models that need to be validated. This step includes all the usual activities you already follow as a model developer. 

**Generate model documentation**
: Use the Developer Framework to generate automated model documentation and run validation tests. This step includes making use of the automation and testing functionality provided by the framework and uploading the output to the Platform UI. You can iteratively regenerate the documentation as you work though the next step.

**Refine model documentation**
: In the ValidMind Platform UI, review the generated documentation and test output. Iterate over the documentation and test output to refine your model documentation. Collaborate with other developers and model validators to finalize the model documentation and get it ready for review. 

**Submit for review**
: In the ValidMind Platform UI, you submit the model documentation for review which moves the documentation workflow moves to the next phase where a model validator will review it.

## Adopting the framework for your use case

Let's explore the approach to generating and refining documentation further to understand the process of using the ValidMind Developer Framework in production better.

<!--- NR How do developers verify the current documentation template? --->
Before you, as a model developer, can use the Developer Framework, you should verify that the current documentation template contains all the necessary tests for the model they need. The template might already be sufficient and you only need to run the template within the Developer Framework to populate documentation. Or, more likely, the template might need additional tests that you can add these tests via the Developer Framework. 

We call this process of verifying the suitability of the the current documentation template or adding more tests to the template the ***template building*** and ***template execution*** phases. 

This is an iterative process:

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[1. Build template] --> B[2. Run template]
    B --> A
```
<br>

<!--- TO DO We need to add some links to these steps (to test: can you add content blocks to templates via the same method as adding them to documentation projects?) ---> 
1. **Build the template:** When the documentation template requires more tests to be added, or if the documentation template does not include a specific content or test block you need: 

   - Use the Developer Framework to [to add the relevant tests or content blocks](add-content-blocks.qmd) for the model use case. 
    
   - If a test you need is not provided out of the box, [add your own external test provider](../notebooks/external_test_providers_demo.ipynb).

2. **Run the template:** When you have registered all the required tests as content blocks in the documentation template,  populate the necessary model documentation with this call in your model:
   
   ```
   run_template()
   ```

Please note that ValidMind may not support all potential use cases or provide a universally applicable documentation template. Typically, you initiate the process of putting ValidMind into production by constructing a template specific for your own use case and refine your the documenation project.

## Generating documentation with the framework

The high-level workflow that a model developer should steps through when populating a documentation template with ValidMind is as follows:

### In your modeling environment

1. Build the model.

2. Export datasets and models.

3. In your documentation environment, load training datasets and models.

### In your documentation environment

1. Create notebook to select and build relevant tests.

2. From your modeling environment, load trained datasets and models.

3. Initialize developer framework.

4. Select relevant tests.

5. Check if all tests covered by ValidMind or custom test provider?
   
   If yes: 
      a. Run selected tests.
      b. Review test results. 
   
   If no: Create and register additional tests.

6. Run selected tests.

7. Review test results.

8. In the ValidMind Platform UI, add content blocks to model documentation. 

### In ValidMind Platform UI

1. Register new model

2. Select documentation template

3. Review template structure

4. View framework integration instructions

5. Add content blocks to model documentation: 
   
   Select the block type:
   
      - Test-driven block: Select from available test provider results
      - Text block: 
         
         New or existing block?:
            New:
               - Add new editable text content block
               - Review and collaborate
            Existing: Select from available texts from content provider 

6. Submit for review.
