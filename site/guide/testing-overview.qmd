This topic provides an overview for what _tests_ and _test suites_ are in the ValidMind Developer Framework, when to use tests and test suites, and typical scenarios. 

## What are tests and test suites?

Tests
: Tests are designed to run a specific quantitative test on the dataset or model. Test results are sent to the ValidMind Platform to generate the model documentation according to the relevant templates. 

Test suites
: Test suites are collections of tests which are run together to automate generating model documentation end-to-end for specific use-cases. 

   Example: the [`classifier_full_suite`](../validmind/validmind/test_suites/classifier.html#ClassifierFullSuite) test suite runs the tests from the [`tabular_dataset`](../validmind/validmind/test_suites/tabular_datasets.html) and [`classifier`](../validmind/validmind/test_suites/classifier.html) test suites to fully document the data and model sections for binary classification model use-cases. 

## When do I use tests and test suites?

ValidMind provides many built-in tests and test suites which make it easy for a model developer to document their work at any point during the model development lifecycle when they need to validate that their work satisfies model risk management requirements. 

While you, as a model developer, have the flexibility to decide when to use which ValidMind tests, we have identified a few typical scenarios with their own characteristics and needs:

### Dataset testing

To document and validate your dataset:

- For generic tabular datasets: use the [`tabular_dataset`](../validmind/validmind/test_suites/tabular_datasets.html) test suite.
- For time-series datasets: use the [`time_series_dataset`](../validmind/validmind/test_suites/time_series.html#TimeSeriesDataset) test suite.

### Model testing

To document and validate your model:

- For binary classification models: use the [`classifier`](../validmind/validmind/test_suites/classifier.html) test suite.
- For time series models: use the [`timeseries`](../validmind/validmind/test_suites/time_series.html) test suite.

### End-to-end testing

To document a binary classification model and the relevant dataset end-to-end: 

Use the [`classifier_full_suite`](../validmind/validmind/test_suites/classifier.html#ClassifierFullSuite) test suite.

## Can I use my own tests?

Yes, ValidMind supports custom tests that you develop yourself or that are provided by third-party test libraries, also referred to as _test providers_. We provide instructions with code examples that you can adapt:

- [Implement Custom Metrics and Threshold Tests](../notebooks/how_to/implementing_custom_tests.ipynb)
- [Integrate an External Test Provider](../notebooks/code_samples/custom_tests/external_test_providers_demo.ipynb)

## Is there an API reference available?

See the [ValidMind Developer Framework API Reference](reference.qmd) for a list of all of the built-in tests and test suites for datasets and models.
