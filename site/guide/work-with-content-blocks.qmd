Learn to add or remove content blocks in your documentation project, enabling you to update or modify your model documentation. This topic is relevant for model developers and validators wishing to expand or condense a documentation project.

## What are content blocks? 

Content blocks provide you with sections that are part of a template. You can think of these sections as an empty canvas that you fill in with text, metrics, and test results. Multiple sections are joined to create a longer document with a table of contents that has different heading and subheading levels, such as 1., 1.1., and so on. 

Types of content blocks: 

Simple text block
: Can be added anywhere on model documentation pages and edited to include additional documentation in text format.

Test-driven block
: Can be added to display one of the supported metrics or threshold test results collected by the Developer Framework.

## Prerequisites

- The model you are documenting is [registered in the model inventory](register-models.qmd).
- You are logged into the ValidMind Platform as a model developer.

## Add content blocks

1. Navigate to the relevant model documentation project:

    a. In the **Documentation Projects** page, select the project you want to edit.
    b. Inside your documentation project, navigate to the **Documentation** page.
    c. Select one of the numbered sections, such as **1.1 Model Overview**. 

2. In your documentation, hover your mouse over the space where you want your new block to go until a horizontal dashed line with a {{< fa square-plus >}} sign appears that indicates you can insert a new block:

    ![](add-content-block.gif){width=90%}

3. Click {{< fa square-plus >}} and then select one of the available options: 
    
    - **Simple text block**: Adds a new section with a blank content block. After the new content block has been added, click {{< fa pencil >}} to edit the contents of the section like any other.
    - **Test-driven block**: Select one of the options:
        - **Metric**: Select one of the available metrics, such as **Confusion Matrix**.
        - **Threshold test**: Select one of the available threshold tests, such as **Data Quality: Skewness** or **Model Diagnosis: Overfit Regions**.
    
4. For test-driven blocks, a preview of the available metrics or threshold test gets shown. Click **Insert module** when you are ready.

After you have completed these steps, the new content block becomes a part of your model documentation.

<!--- TO DO We might need to revisit terminology: we talk about "block", "section", and "module", but they all seem to be names for very similar things.--->

## Remove content blocks

1. Navigate to the relevant model documentation project:

    a. In the **Documentation Projects** page, select the project you want to edit.
    b. Inside your documentation project, navigate to the **Documentation** page.
    c. Select one of the numbered sections, such as **1.1 Model Overview**. 

2. Select the block you wish to remove from the documentation project.

3. Click on {{< fa trash-can >}} located in either one of these locations:

   - In the toolbar for text blocks
   
   ![](remove-text-block.gif)

   - In the single-button toolbar for the test-driven block

   ![](remove-test-driven-block.gif)

After you have completed these steps, the content block is removed. Test-driven blocks can be re-added later on but text blocks are currently deleted permanently.
