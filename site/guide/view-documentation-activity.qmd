Use the audit trail functionality in the {{< var vm_platform >}} to track or audit all the information events associated with a specific model.

## Prerequisites

This topic matters for model developers, model validators, and auditors.

* The model you are documenting is registered in the model inventory
* Model documentation has already been created for this project
* A model developer has started generating documentation, either using the {{< var vm_dev >}} or via the online UI editor

## Steps

1. [Log in to the {{< var vm_platform >}}]({{< var vm_url >}}).

2. In the left sidebar, click [**Model Inventory**]({{< var vm_url >}}/model-inventory).

3. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.

4. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Model Activity**.

The table in this page shows a record of all activities, including: 

- Project updates generated by the {{< var vm_dev >}} (`API Client`) 
- Actions performed on the project by users in your organization
