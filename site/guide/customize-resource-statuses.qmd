Statuses are manipulated via workflow transitions and are used to track the progress of resources through your organization's processes.

Default statuses are provided for you as suggestions. You can add, edit, remove, and define your own custom statuses in each category:

- **Model documentation**
- **Model lifecycle**

<!-- Model validation statuses are in missing as of May 2024 -->

## Prerequisites

To add, edit, or delete statuses, you must hold the `Customer Admin` or `Developer` role.

## Add or edit statuses

1. {{< var vm_login >}}

2. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

3. UnderWorkplace Settings, select **{{< fa arrow-right-arrow-left >}} Statuses**.

4. Under Available Statuses, select the process you'd like to add or edit statuses for:

    - To add a status, click **+ Add New Status**.
    - To edit a status, click on the status itself.
