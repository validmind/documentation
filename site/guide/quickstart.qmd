### ValidMind Developer Framework

To try the ValidMind Developer Framework, you need access to ONE of the following:

- [Jupyter Hub](quickstart-try-developer-framework-with-jupyterhub.qmd) (recommended)
- [Google Colaboratory](quickstart-try-developer-framework-with-colab.qmd)
- [Local developer environment](quickstart-try-developer-framework-in-your-own-developer-environment.qmd)

### ValidMind Platform UI

We support most modern browsers, such as Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, or Mozilla Firefox.

To upload from the developer framework to the ValidMind Platform and to access the web user interface, you must be able to access our domains:

- validmind.ai
- validmind.com

If necessary, ask a network administrator to add these domains to your firewall allowlist (whitelist). 

If your company has strict security requirements and requires you to connect via VPN or AWS PrivateLink, please contact your IT/InfoSec team. For additional help setting up a VPN or PrivateLink with ValidMind's MRM platform please visit [configure AWS PrivateLink](configure-aws-privatelink.qmd) or send an email to <support@validmind.ai>.
