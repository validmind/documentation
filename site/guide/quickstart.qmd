   Try our introductory Jupyter notebook to see the Developer Framework in action.

4. [Explore the Platform UI](create-your-first-documentation-project.qmd)

    Explore our Platform UI to work with a documentation project and see the results of tests you run.

5. [Next Steps](next-steps.qmd)

   Try some more advanced sample notebooks or set up ValidMind for production with your own use cases.
