The easiest way to get started with ValidMind is to try out our Developer Framework in Jupyter Hub and to explore the ValidMind Platform UI online. 

## Before you begin

::: {.callout-tip}
## Don't have access?
[Request a trial](https://validmind.com/demo) to try out ValidMind for free. 
:::

To try out ValidMind, you need to be a registered user on the ValidMind Platform.

To connect the ValidMind Developer Framework to the ValidMind Platform and to access the web user interface, you must be able to access our domains:

- validmind.ai
- validmind.com

If necessary, ask a network administrator to add these domains to your firewall allowlist (whitelist). 

If your company has strict security requirements and requires you to connect via VPN or AWS PrivateLink, please contact your IT/InfoSec team. For additional help setting up a VPN or PrivateLink with ValidMind's MRM platform please visit [configure AWS PrivateLink](configure-aws-privatelink.qmd) or send an email to <support@validmind.ai>.

### Quickstart requirements

To follow the Quickstart, you need access to ONE of the following:

- [Jupyter Hub](try-developer-framework-with-jupyterhub.qmd) (**recommended**)
- [Google Colaboratory (Colab)](try-developer-framework-with-colab.qmd)
- [Docker Desktop](try-developer-framework-with-docker.qmd)

To run our sample Jupyter notebooks locally, your developer environment must support **Python 3.8+**.

### Access to the ValidMind Platform UI

You need to be able to access our ValidMind Web UI from a modern browser such as Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, or Mozilla Firefox.

## Steps

1. [Try the Developer Framework](try-developer-framework-with-jupyterhub.qmd) (10 minutes)

   Try our introductory Jupyter notebook to see the Developer Framework in action. 

2. [Explore the Platform UI](create-your-first-documentation-project.qmd) (15 minutes)

    Explore our Platform UI to work with a documentation project and see the results of tests you run.
