The easiest way to get started with ValidMind is to try out our Developer Framework in Jupyter Hub and to explore the ValidMind Platform UI online. 

This Quickstart takes about 20 minutes of your time.

## Steps

1. [Before you begin](before-you-begin.qmd)

   Check the prerequisites for the Developer Framework and ValidMind Platform UI.

2. [Explore ValidMind](explore-validmind.qmd)

   Try our introductory Jupyter notebook to see the Developer Framework in action and explore our Platform UI to work with a documentation project and see the results of tests you run.

4. [Next steps](next-steps.qmd)

   Try some more advanced sample notebooks or set up ValidMind for production with your own use cases.
