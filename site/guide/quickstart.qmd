The easiest way to get started with ValidMind is to try out our Developer Framework and explore the ValidMind Platform. This Quickstart takes about 15 minutes of your time.

## Steps

1. [Before you begin](before-you-begin.qmd)

   Check the prerequisites for the Developer Framework and ValidMind Platform UI.

2. [Try out the ValidMind Developer Framework](try-developer-framework.qmd)

   Try our introductory Jupyter notebook to see the Developer Framework in action and get access to the notebook source.

3. [Explore the ValidMind Platform](explore-validmind-platform.qmd)

   Explore your uploads in our Platform UI, create your own documentation project, and get ready to upload documentation and test data from one of our sample Jupyter notebooks. 

4. [Next steps](next-steps.qmd)

   Try some more advanced sample notebooks or set up ValidMind for production with your own use cases.
