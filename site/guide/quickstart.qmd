   Check the prerequisites for the Developer Framework and ValidMind Platform UI.

2. [Try out the ValidMind Developer Framework](try-developer-framework.qmd)

   Try our introductory Jupyter notebook to see the Developer Framework in action and get access to the notebook source.

3. [Explore the ValidMind Platform](explore-validmind-platform.qmd)

   Create your own documentation project, upload documentation and test data from one of our sample Jupyter notebooks, and explore your uploads in our Platform UI. 

4. [Next steps](next-steps.qmd)
