Managing roles is crucial for maintaining a secure and well-organized environment. Assign, update, and view permissions for different roles, and ensure that each role has appropriate access to the resources they need. 

## Prerequisites

- {{< var link.login >}}

- To manage roles, you must have the following permissions:[^1] 

    - **Roles** — Permission to read, add, update, and delete roles. 
    - **Users** — Permission to read, add, update, and delete users. 
    
    By default, the `Customer Admin` role has all these permissions.
