## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] You are a [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^1]

:::

## Add or update roles

::: {.callout-important title="Role permissions and role assignments determine a user's level of access."}

- The [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} role has the highest level of access and, as such, cannot be modified.

- The [{{< fa wrench >}} Basic User]{.bubble} role has the lowest level of access, providing only limited access until an administrator grants further permissions. Since every user must hold this role to sign in, it is not typically shown on the platform.
