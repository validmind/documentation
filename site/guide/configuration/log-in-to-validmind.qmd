Log in to our cloud-hosted {{< var validmind.platform >}} to work with your model documentation, prepare validation reports, or to configure {{< var vm.product >}} for your organization.

{{< var vm.product >}} supports the following methods for logging in:

- [Public internet](#public-internet) — minimal configuration needed
- [Private network endpoints](#private-network-endpoints) — requires additional configuration

::: {.attn}

## Prerequisites

- [x] A valid email address registered with the {{< var validmind.platform >}} and your password.
- [x] Alternatively, your SSO credentials.

<!-- For most users, someone with the Customer Admin role will invite you to your organization.  -->

::: {.callout}
## To log in, you'll need access to a {{< var vm.product >}} account.

{{< var link.register >}} 
:::

:::

## Public internet

{{< include _validmind-public-internet.qmd >}}

1. Click **Sign in to {{< var vm.product >}}**. 

1. Choose one of the login options:

   - Enter your email address and password, and click **Continue**.
   - Select one of the single sign-on (SSO) login options, such as Google, GitHub, or Microsoft, and complete the login steps. 

    After successful login, you will be redirected to the main dashboard of the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.

## Basic ValidMind access

If you are a new user signing in for the first time, you might have only _a basic ValidMind user role_. This role allows you to authenticate but provides limited access to your organization, models, and platform features.

If you are unable to access platform features after logging in, ask an administrator to:

- Assign you to one or more groups[^1]
- Grant you the appropriate roles[^2]

After groups and roles have been assigned, you will gain access to available models and workflows. You will also be able to perform actions based on your permissions, such as working on model documentation, running tests, or completing validations.

## {{< var validmind.vpv >}}

To configure and log in through a private link for your company VPC using a supported service:
