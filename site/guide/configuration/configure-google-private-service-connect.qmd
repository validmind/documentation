To keep your network traffic private and minimize its attack surface, configure Private Service Connect to establish a private connection between ValidMind and your company network.

![Google Private Service Connect establishing a private connection to ValidMind](google-cloud-private-service-connect.png){fig-alt="A graphic showing Google Private Service Connect establishing a private connection to ValidMind"}

Private Service Connect is a networking service that allows secure and private communication between Google Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) resources and services hosted in other VPCs or Google partner services, such as ValidMind. By creating private endpoints within your VPC, Private Service Connect allows you to connect to services over the Google network without needing to expose your network traffic to the public internet.

::: {.callout-important title="The responsibility of setting up endpoints for Private Service Connect falls to your IT department, such as the cloud engineering, infrastructure, or security teams."}

To learn more about Private Service Connect, check the official Google documentation.[^1]

::: {.prereq}

## Prerequisites

You must have access to the Google Cloud Console for your company and the necessary expertise to set up, configure, and maintain Google Cloud services.

These steps assume that you already have established connectivity between your own company network and Google VPC and know which company VPC you want to connect to.

### VPC service information

| Name | Provider |  Region       | Service name                                            | Private DNS name             |
| -- | -- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |

## Configure your Google Cloud Platform project

Enable the APIs for cloud DNS and networking to get ready for the next steps:

1. Log into the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

2. From the **Select a project** drop-down at the top of the console, select the project where you want to enable the Google APIs.

3. In the navigation menu on the left, click **APIs & Services** and then **Library**.

4. In the API Library, search for "Cloud DNS API" and click the result to open the API page.

5. On the API page for Cloud DNS, click **Enable** to activate the API for your project.

6. Repeat these steps for the Networking API:

   a. Click **Library** in the left navigation to return to the API Library.
   b. Search for "Google Compute Engine API" which includes networking services.
   c. Click on the search result and click **Enable** to activate the API.

After these steps, both the Cloud DNS and the Google Compute Engine API should be enabled for your project, allowing you to manage DNS configurations and networking resources.

## Request access from ValidMind

Contact ValidMind at [support@validmind.ai](mailto:support@validmind.ai?subject=VPC%20Endpoint%20Connection%20Request) to get your new VPC endpoint connection request accepted. Include the following information:

   - The project name
   - The project ID

::: {.callout}
Please provide this information to ValidMind **at least 24 hours** before attempting to connect, so that we can add your project to the allowlist.
:::

## Prepare your network for connection

Create a private subnet in a supported GCP region that can be used to expose ValidMind services: 

1. In Google Cloud Console, create the subnet: 

   a. On the VPC networks page, click **Create VPC network**.
   b. Name your network.
   c. Configure the IP address range to ensure it includes at least a `/28` of usable private IP address space.
   d. Click **Create**.

2. Optional: Enable Private Google Access to provide access to Google APIs and services.[^2]

3. Provision two IP addresses in this subnet for later use: 

   a. On the VPC networks page, select your subnet.
   c. Note the available IP address range.
   d. Reserve two IP addresses within this range for future use.

## Create an endpoint to connect to ValidMind

Create a Private Service Connect endpoint for accessing ValidMind services securely and privately, with service discovery managed via Google Cloud’s Service Directory.

![Creating an endpoint in the Google Cloud Console](gcp-add-validmind-endpoint-panel.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of an endpoint being created with the options specified in the steps"}

### Steps

1. In Google Cloud Console, open **Network services** and click **Private Service Connect**.

2. Create the endpoint:

   a. Click **Create Connection Endpoint**.
   b. Check **Published service** for the target.
   c. For **Endpoint name**, enter `private`.
   d. For **Target service**, enter:
   
       `projects/validmind-us3-prod/regions/us-central1/serviceAttachments/private`.
   
   e. For **IP address**, enter `validmind`.
      
      ::: {.callout}
      Make sure this name resolves to an appropriate IP in your network settings or is preconfigured in your DNS.
      ::: 

   f. Enable Service Directory for this endpoint to provide DNS resolution and enable service discovery.

      ::: {.callout}
      Choose the same region as your endpoint to ensure low latency and local management of services.
      ::: 
   
   g. For **Namespace**, enter `validmind`.

   h. Click **Add Endpoint**.

After the endpoint is active, test that the service is reachable through the private connection and that DNS requests resolve as expected.

## Create an endpoint to connect to the ValidMind authentication service

Repeat the steps to create an endpoint to connect to ValidMind[^3] to add another endpoint for the ValidMind authentication service.

![Creating an endpoint in the Google Cloud Console](gcp-add-auth-endpoint-panel.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of an endpoint being created with the options specified in the steps"}

### Steps

1. Check **Published service** for the target.
2. For **Target service**, enter:

      `projects/validmind-us3-prod/regions/us-central1/serviceAttachments/auth`.

3. For **Endpoint name**, enter `auth`.
4. Enable Service Directory for this endpoint
5. For **Namespace**, enter `validmind`.

After the endpoint is active, test that the service is reachable through the private connection and that DNS requests resolve as expected.

## Test connectivity

As a final step, test that everything everything is set up correctly and that you can reach the ValidMind services:

1. Under Network Services > Cloud DNS, verify that DNS and service discovery are functioning as expected.

2. Test your connection to the following hosts:
  - **{{< var validmind.platform >}}** — [{{< var gcp.connect >}}]({{< var gcp.connect >}})
  - **ValidMind authentication service** — [{{< var gcp.authentication >}}]({{< var gcp.authentication >}})
