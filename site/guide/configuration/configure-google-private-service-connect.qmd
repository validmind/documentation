To keep your network traffic private and minimize its attack surface, configure Private Service Connect to establish a private connection between ValidMind and your company network.

Private Service Connect^[[Private Service Connect](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect)] is a networking service that allows secure and private communication between Google Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) resources and services hosted in other VPCs or Google partner services, such as ValidMind. By creating private endpoints within your VPC, Private Service Connect allows you to connect to services over the Google network without needing to expose your network traffic to the public internet.

Private Service Connect works by creating private _endpoints_ within your Google Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that act as secure entry points for connecting to Google services and third-party services. These endpoints serve as proxies, forwarding traffic securely within Google's network without exposing it to the public internet. To make the endpoint easier to use, ValidMind provides a _private DNS name_ that model developers and validators can connect to in a browser.

## Prerequisites

You must have access to the Google Cloud Console for your company and the necessary expertise to set up, configure, and maintain Google Cloud services.

These steps assume that you already have established connectivity between your own company network and Google VPC and know which company VPC you want to connect to.

### VPC service information

| Region       | Service name                                            | Private DNS name             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `us-west1`    | Email <support@validmind.com> | Email <support@validmind.com> |

## Steps

1. Create a Private Service Connect endpoint for ValidMind:

   a. Log into the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   b. In the VPC Network dashboard, click **Private Service Connect** in the navigation pane.
   c. Click **Create endpoint**.
   d. Select **Endpoint for services from other VPCs**.
   e. Enter the service name from the [VPC service information](#vpc-service-information) table and click **Next**.
   f. Select the company VPC that you want to create the endpoint in.
   g. Select the subnets where you want to create the endpoint network interfaces.
   h. Configure the firewall rules for the VPC endpoint. Ensure that you allow traffic between your network and the endpoint.
   i. Click **Create endpoint**.

   The status for the endpoint should show `Pending`.

2. Contact ValidMind at [support@validmind.ai](mailto:support@validmind.ai?subject=VPC%20Endpoint%20Connection%20Request) to get your new VPC endpoint connection request accepted. Include the following information:

   - The project ID
   - The VPC endpoint ID

3. After ValidMind has accepted your endpoint connection request, verify the endpoint is available:

   a. In the VPC Network console, go to the **Private Service Connect** section.
   b. Verify that the status for the end
