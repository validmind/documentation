To keep your network traffic private and minimize its attack surface, configure Azure Private Link[^1] to establish a private connection between {{< var vm.product >}} and your company network.

![Azure Private Link establishing a private connection to {{< var vm.product >}}](azure-private-link.png){fig-alt="A graphic showing Azure Private Link establishing a private connection to ValidMind"}

Azure Private Link is a networking service that allows secure and private communication between Azure Virtual Network (VNet) resources and services hosted in other VNets or in Azure partner services, such as {{< var vm.product >}}. With Azure Private Link, you can connect to services over the Azure network without exposing your network traffic to the public internet.

Private Link works by creating a _private endpoint_ for a supported Azure service within your virtual private cloud. This endpoint acts as a proxy between your VNet and {{< var vm.product >}}, allowing traffic to be routed privately over the Azure network. To make the endpoint easier to use, {{< var vm.product >}} provides a _private DNS name_ that model developers and validators can connect to in a browser.

## Prerequisites

You must have access to the Azure portal for your company and the necessary expertise to set up, configure, and maintain Azure services.

These steps assume that you already have established connectivity between your own company network and an Azure virtual network (VNet) and know which company VNet you want to connect to.

### VNet service information

| Region       | Service name                         | Private DNS name             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `us-west-2`  | Email <{{< var validmind.support >}}>        | Email <{{< var validmind.support >}}> |

## Steps

1. Create an Azure Private Endpoint:

   a. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).  
   b. Search for **Private Endpoints** under the services section.  
   c. Click **Create**:  
      - Select the **subscription** and **resource group**.  
      - Provide a name for the endpoint.  
   d. In the **Resource** tab, select:  
      - The **resource type**  
      - The specific **resource**  
      - The **sub-resource**  
   e. For networking, select:  
      - The **virtual network** (VNet)  
      - The **subnet** for the private endpoint  
   f. Recommended: When prompted, integrate with an Azure **Private DNS zone** to simplify private IP name resolution.  
   g. Review the configuration and then click **Create** to deploy the private endpoint.

2. Contact {{< var vm.product >}} at [{{< var validmind.support >}}](mailto:{{< var validmind.support >}}?subject=VNet%20Endpoint%20Connection%20Request) to get your new private endpoint connection request accepted. Include the following information:

   - The owner or account ID  
   - The private endpoint IP address

3. After {{< var vm.product >}} has accepted your endpoint connection request, verify the endpoint is available:

   a. In the Azure portal, go to the **Private Endpoints** section.  
   b. Verify that the connection status is `Approved`. This indicates that the endpoint is properly connected to the target service.

4. Enable the private DNS name:

   a. Check the private endpoint you created, click the **Actions** menu, and select **Modify private DNS name**.  
   b. Select **Enable for this endpoint**.  
   c. Click **Save changes**.  
   d. Verify that **Private DNS names** shows the name shown in the [VNet service information](#vnet-service-information).

5. Test the connection:

   a. From your company network, access {{< var vm.product >}} using the private DNS name from the [VNet service information](#vnet-service-information).  
   b. In a browser, confirm that you can successfully connect to {{< var vm.product >}} and log in.  
   c. From your developer environment, confirm that you can connect to {{< var vm.product >}} with the {{< var vm.developer >}}.

## What's next

After completing these steps, users on your company network can connect to {{< var vm.product >}} via Azure Private Link using the private DNS name from the [VNet service information](#vnet-service-information).
