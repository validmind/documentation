Use permissions to streamline and secure access control within your organization. Add or remove roles for specific permissions and ensure that individuals have access to the right features.

## Prerequisites

- {{< var link.login >}}

- You are a `Customer Admin`, or assigned another role that has access to manage user permissions.[^1] 

## Steps

::: {.callout-important}
Be careful when modifying permissions to ensure they align with the role's intended responsibilities and access requirements.
:::

1. Click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

{{< include _manage-permissions.qmd >}}

### Default permissions

::: {.callout}
Please note that the `Customer Admin` role has the highest level of access and as such, its permissions cannot be modified.
