Permissions dictate user access controls within the {{< var validmind.platform >}}, and are associated with specific roles. Assign granular permissions to roles according to your organization's custom requirements.

{{< var vm.product >}} uses a two-level permission system:

- **Organization-level permissions** control access to platform-wide settings and are assigned through organization roles (Customer Admin, Developer, Validator, Basic User).
- **Model-level permissions** control what users can do within specific models and are assigned when users are added as stakeholders to a model (Model Owner, Model Developer, Model Validator).

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] Roles must exist in order to be assigned permissions.[^1]
- [x] You are a [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^2]

## Steps

::: {.callout-important title="When assigning permissions to roles, ensure they align with the role's intended responsibilities and access requirements."}
Please note that the [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} role has the highest level of access and as such its permissions cannot be modified.
