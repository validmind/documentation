Learn how to use `list_plans()`, `list_test()`, and `describe_plan()` methods to view and describe test plans and tests available in the Developer Framework. 

## Prerequisites

* You are a registered user on the ValidMind Platform
* You are working on an active documentation project
* You have already installed the ValidMind client library in your developer environment

## Steps

1. [Initialize the client library](install-and-initialize-get-started-developer-framework.qmd).

2. Use `list_plans()` and `list_tests()` to view the list of all available test plans and tests. 

   Examples: 

   - List all available test plans currently available in the the Developer Framework: 

      ```python
      vm.test_plans.list_plans()
      ```

   - List all available individual tests currently available in the Developer Framework: 

      ```python
      vm.test_plans.list_tests() 
      ```

3. Use `describe_testplan()` to list all the tests included in a specific test plan: 

   Example: The following code will list tests included in the tabular_data_quality test plan: 

   ```python
   vm.test_plans.describe_plan("tabular_data_quality") 
   ```
