This topic describes how to use list_plans(), list_test(), and describe_plan() methods to view and describe test plans and tests available in the Developer Framework. 

## Prerequisites

* You are a registered user on the ValidMind Platform
* You are working on an active documentation project
* You have already installed the ValidMind client library in your developer environment

## Steps

1. Initialize the client library ***Insert Link***

2. Use list_plans() and list_tests() to view the list of all available test plans and tests 

Examples: 

* The following code will list all available test plans currently available in the the Developer Framework: 

```python
vm.test_plans.list_plans()
```

* The following code will list all available individual tests currently available in the Developer Framework: 

```python
vm.test_plans.list_tests() 
```

3. Use describe_testplan() to list all the tests included in a specific test plan: 

Example: The following code will list tests included in the tabular_data_quality test plan: 

```python
vm.test_plans.describe_plan("tabular_data_quality") 
```


## Troubleshooting

[Include any common issues or errors that may arise during the task and how to resolve them.]

## What's Next

* Document models with the Developer Framework
