This page outlines ValidMind's data privacy policy, detailing how we collect, use, store, and protect your information. Our goal is to ensure transparency in our data practices, enabling you to make an informed decision about using our products.

ValidMind does NOT: 

- Send any personal identifiable information (PII) when generating documentation reports.
- Store any customer datasets or models.

## What model artifacts are automatically imported into documentation and how are they retained?

ValidMind is a Developer Framework and cloud platform available in multiple editions that cater to different organizational needs. 

ValidMind's platform is a multi-tenant solution hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). For organizations requiring the highest degree of data security, ValidMind offers a "Virtual Private ValidMind" option to host the solution in a dedicated single-tenant cloud instance on the ValidMind AWS account. Furthermore, ValidMind's data retention policy complies with the SOC 2 security standard.

Access to any edition is facilitated through AWS PrivateLink, which provides private connectivity between ValidMind and your on-premises networks without exposing your traffic to the public internet. To learn more, check [Configure AWS PrivateLink](configure-aws-privatelink.qmd). ValidMind does not send any personally identifiable information (PII) through our API.

- Metadata about datasets and models, used to lookup programmatic documentation content, such as the stored definition for _common logistic regression limitations_ when a logistic regression model has been passed to the ValidMind test suite to be run.
- Quality and performance metrics collected from datasets and models.
- Output from test and test suites that have been run.
- Images, plots, visuals that were generated as part of extracting metrics and running tests.
