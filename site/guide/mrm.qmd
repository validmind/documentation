Model risk management (MRM) is a process for organizations using mathematical and statistical models to inform decision-making. MRM aims to identify, assess, and mitigate risks arising from model usage, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of model outputs.

## Model Risk
Model risk arises from incorrect or inappropriate use of models, inaccurate assumptions, or limitations in data quality. Consequences can include financial losses, reputational damage, and regulatory penalties. Effective MRM is essential to minimize these risks.

## Three Lines of Defense
MRM is structured around three lines of defense. The first line consists of business units responsible for model development, validation, and implementation. They ensure that models are accurate, robust, and fit for purpose. The second line is an independent model risk oversight function that provides a governance framework and guidance for model risk management. The third line is the internal audit function, which assesses the effectiveness of MRM practices and controls.

## Model Development and Validation
Model development involves creating a model that accurately represents the underlying system or process. This stage requires rigorous documentation and testing, including sensitivity analysis and stress testing. Model validation is the independent evaluation of a model's conceptual soundness, performance, and adherence to regulatory requirements. It ensures that a model's assumptions and methodologies are appropriate and that the model is fit for its intended use.

## Model Governance
Effective MRM requires a strong governance framework, including clear roles and responsibilities, reporting lines, and escalation procedures. Model governance ensures that all models within an organization are developed, validated, and maintained in accordance with established policies and procedures.

## Model Inventory and Monitoring
A comprehensive model inventory is essential for effective MRM. It documents all models used by an organization, their purpose, and their associated risks. Regular monitoring of model performance, assumptions, and limitations helps to identify and address potential issues before they become significant risks.
