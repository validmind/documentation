Model findings are detailed observations identified during the model validation process, highlighting any major or minor issues, deficiencies, model limitations, stability and robustness concerns, or needed adjustments.

These findings are critical for understanding the risk exposure and compliance status of models within an organization. To make them easier to track, findings are typically categorized by risk area, business unit, model status, and individual model, enabling targeted resolution and informed decision-making to mitigate identified risks and ensure model reliability and accuracy.

## Prerequisites

- You hold the `Validator` role
- The model is already [registered in the model inventory](register-models-in-model-inventory.qmd)
- A model document project is completed or in progress

## View model findings

To view all project findings: 

1. [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_url >}}).

2. In the left sidebar, click [**Model Findings**]({{< var vm_url >}}/model-findings).

   In the page that opens, you can see a list of all model findings, including information for:

   - Title
   - Severity
   - Status
   - Inventory model
   - Risk area
   - Assignee
   - Due date

3. Click on any model finding for more information, including the proposed remediation plan.

## Filter project findings

By default, all model findings for all models are displayed and sorted by creation date, with the latest findings displayed first. To narrow down the findings to only those you want to see, you can apply some filters:

1. [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_url >}}).

2. In the left sidebar, click [**Model Findings**]({{< var vm_url >}}/model-findings) and then click {{< fa filter >}} **Filter**.

3. On the **Select your filters** dialog that opens, select your filtering criteria for:

   - Status
   - Model inventory
   - Risk area
   - Business units
   - Severity
   - Assignee

   For example: To filter by open findings for the Customer Churn Model assigned to Jane Doe:

   ![](filter.png){width=60% fig-alt="A screenshot of the filter dialog with some options selected."}

4. Click **Apply Filters**.

Filters can be removed by clicking on the {{< fa xmark >}} next to them on the main [**Model Findings**]({{< var vm_url >}}/model-findings) page where the results are displayed. 

## Add project findings

As part of validation process, you may find issues with the model documentation that must be resolved. To indicate that there is an issue and to track the resolution, you add a new finding:

1. [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_url >}}).

2. In the left sidebar, click [**Model Inventory**]({{< var vm_url >}}/model-inventory).

3. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.

4. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Documentation**.

5. On the page that opens, click **Add Finding**.

6. On the **Add Project Finding** page that opens,  provide information for: 

   - Title
   - Risk area
   - Owner
   - Severity
   - Due date
   - Description

   At a minimum, you must provide the required information indicated by `*`.

## Update project findings

As project findings get resolved or require other changes during the model validation process, you can update them:

1. [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_url >}}).

2. In the left sidebar, click [**Model Findings**]({{< var vm_url >}}/model-findings).

3. On the page that opens, click on the finding you want to update or [apply a filter](work-with-model-findings.qmd#filter-project-findings) to locate the correct finding first.

4. On the page that opens, make your updates to the finding. You can make updates to:

   - Description
   - Proposed remediation plan
   - Status
   - Severity
   - Risk area
   - Due date
   - Assignee

Most updates are applied immediately but you must click **Save** to make changes to the finding description and proposed remediation plan effective.
