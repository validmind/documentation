### Suggest a change

1. Click the **{{< fa file-pen >}} Track changes** button in the toolbar to turn on suggestion mode.

2. Make your changes to the model documentation. 

    When changes tracking is enabled, other contributors can accept or decline the suggested changes.

### Resolve changes

1. Suggested changes appear in <span style="color: green">green</span> or <span style="color: red">~~red~~</span> highlighted text, depending on if the change is adding or removing content respectively.

    - To accept or decline a change, click the highlighted text, then click <span style="color: green">{{< fa check >}}</span> or <span style="color: red">{{< fa xmark >}}</span>. 
    - You can also reply to a suggested change.

2. To mass accept or decline suggestions, click the dropdown arrow next to the **{{< fa file-pen >}} Track changes** button and select one of the options:

    - **Accept all suggestions**
