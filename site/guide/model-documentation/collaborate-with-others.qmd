    When changes tracking is enabled, other contributors can accept or decline the suggested changes.

### Resolve changes

1. Suggested changes appear in [green]{.green} or [~~red~~]{.red} highlighted text, depending on if the change is adding or removing content respectively.

    - You can also reply to a suggested change.

2. To mass accept or decline suggestions, click the dropdown arrow next to the **{{< fa file-pen >}} Track changes** button and select one of the options:

    - **Accept all suggestions**
    - **Accept all selected suggestions**

    - **Discard all selected suggestions**

## Revision history

While working with content blocks in documents,[^5] you can save named versions of your edits to retain specific revisions you'd like to keep.
