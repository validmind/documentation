Make edits to your model documents by adding or removing content blocks directly in the online editor.

## What are content blocks?

Content blocks provide you with sections that are part of a template, and are used in model documents.

- You can think of these sections as an empty canvas that you fill in with text and test results.
- Multiple sections are joined to create a longer document with a table of contents that has different heading and subheading levels, such as "1.," "1.1.," and so on.

::: {.callout title="Static PDF documents cannot be edited."}
You can only work with content blocks in PDFs converted to editable documents,[^1] documents generated by the {{< var validmind.developer >}}, or documents created in the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.
:::

#### Content block types

Content blocks can be new, blank blocks, or prepopulated via your library of logged test or metric results and text block templates:

{{< include content_blocks/_simple-text-block.qmd >}}

{{< include content_blocks/_test-driven-block.qmd >}}

{{< include content_blocks/_metric-over-time-block.qmd >}}

### Content editing toolbar

![Content editing toolbar](/guide/model-documentation/content-editing-toolbar.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing the content editing toolbar" .screenshot}

The content editing toolbar is a rich text editor that enables you to:

- Undo or redo changes
- Format your text, including adding hyperlinks and code blocks
- Insert LaTex formulas[^2]
- Attach images via upload or URL

You can also use the toolbar to suggest changes, save named versions of content, and leave comments.[^3] 

::: {.callout title="Stuck on where to start?"}
Use {{< var vm.product >}} to assist you with generating content via AI!^[[Generate content drafts with AI](#generate-content)]
:::

::: {.attn}

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] There are models registered in the model inventory.[^4]
- [x] Documents exist and are completed or are in progress for your model.[^5]
- [x] You are a [{{< fa code >}} Developer]{.bubble} or [{{< fa circle-check >}} Validator]{.bubble}, or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^6]

:::

## Add content blocks

{{< include /guide/model-documentation/_add-content-blocks.qmd >}}

6. Click {{< fa square-plus >}} and then select one of the available options:

   ::: {.panel-tabset}

   #### [new]{.smallcaps}

   Text Block
   : Adds a new section with a blank content block.

   #### [from library]{.smallcaps}
   Text Block
   : Inserts a text block from a template in your block library:[^7]
   a. Select the reusable blocks you want to add.
   b. Click **Insert # Text Block(s) to Document**.

   Test-Driven[^8]
   : Adds a new section with logged test results.

   Metric Over Time[^9]
   : Adds a new section with logged metric over time results.

   :::

7. After adding the block to your document, click on the text to make changes or add comments.[^10]

### Add mathematical formulas

While editing a simple text block, you can insert math equations using the formula editor:

1. Click **$f(x)$** in the toolbar while editing a content block.

2. Enter your LaTeX formula in the text box and confirm that the Equation preview generates as expected:

   - To insert the equation inline, leave **Display mode** untoggled.
   - To insert the equation on its own line, toggle **Display mode** on.

::: {.column-margin}
![Equation preview in the formula editor](equation-preview.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing the equation preview in the formula editor" .screenshot group="latex"}

:::

   ![The two formula display modes](formula-display-modes.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing the two formula display modes" .screenshot group="latex"}

3. Click **[{{< fa check >}}]{.green}** to add the equation to your content block.

<span id="generate-content"></span>

### Generate content drafts with AI

While editing a simple text block, you can have {{< var vm.product >}} assist you with generating content drafts.

::: {.callout title="Have you logged your tests?"}
Generating content drafts works best after you've logged tests with the {{< var validmind.developer >}},[^11] as existing test descriptions provide more context for {{< var vm.product >}}'s content builder to draw upon.
:::

To generate content drafts:
<!-- PDF CONTEXT DOCUMENTS ARE BEHIND A FEATURE FLAG -->

{{< include content_blocks/_generate-with-ai.qmd >}}

When generating content drafts with AI, accepted versions and edits are retained in your {{< fa wifi >}} Model Activity[^12] just like other updates to your documents.

<br>

::: {.callout-button .pl4 .nt4}
::: {.callout collapse="true" appearance="minimal"}
### What context is available in content blocks?

When you generate content, the content builder uses the following context:

- Template guidelines — Instructions from the document template for the current section
- Model metadata:
   - Model name
   - Model purpose
   - Model use
   - Model ID
   - Model inventory fields
- Model document content — Text blocks and test result descriptions from your document (figures and tables are not included)

:::

## Remove content blocks

::: {.callout-important}
Test-driven or metric over time blocks can be re-added later on but **text blocks are currently deleted permanently**.
:::

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^13]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **{{< fa file >}} Documents** and select the **Latest** tab.[^14]

4. Click on the document file you want to remove a block from.[^15]

5. Click on a section header to expand that section and remove content.

6. Locate the block you wish to remove, and hover over it until the block's toolbar appears in the top right-hand corner.

7. Select **{{< fa trash >}} Delete** to remove the block.

8. After you confirm, the content block will be deleted.
