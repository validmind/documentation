Make edits to your model documentation or validation reports by adding or removing content blocks directly in the online editor. 

## What are content blocks? 

Content blocks provide you with sections that are part of a template. You can think of these sections as an empty canvas that you fill in with text, metrics, and test results. Multiple sections are joined to create a longer document with a table of contents that has different heading and subheading levels, such as 1., 1.1., and so on. 

Types of content blocks: 

Simple text block
: Can be added anywhere on model documentation or validation reports and edited to include additional documentation in text format.

Test-driven block
: Can be added to display one of the supported test results collected by the {{< var vm_dev >}}.

## Prerequisites

- You hold the `Developer` or `Validator` role^1^
- The model you are documenting or validating is registered in the model inventory^2^

## Add content blocks


1. Log in to the {{< var vm_login >}}.

2. In the left sidebar, click **Model Inventory**.

3. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it^3^.

^3^ [Working with the model inventory](/guide/model-inventory/working-with-model-inventory.qmd#search-filter-and-sort-models)
:::

4. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Documentation** or **Validation Report**.

   You can now jump to any section of the model documentation or validation report by expanding the table of contents on the left and selecting the relevant section you would like to add content to, such as **1.1 Model Overview**. 

5. Hover your mouse over the space where you want your new block to go until a horizontal dashed line with a {{< fa square-plus >}} sign appears that indicates you can insert a new block:

    ![](add-content-block.gif){width=90%}

6. Click {{< fa square-plus >}} and then select one of the available options: 
    
    - **Simple text block**: Adds a new section with a blank content block. After the new content block has been added, click {{< fa pencil >}} to edit the contents of the section like any other.
    - **Test-driven block**: Adds a new section with test results. 

7. For test-driven blocks, a menu containing the available tests appears. Select tests using one of these methods:


      ![](test-driven-block-menu.png){width=85% fig-alt="A screenshot showing several test-driven blocks that have been selected for insertion into the model documentation."}

   - Select the tests to insert into the model documentation from the list of available tests.
   - Search by name using **{{<fa magnifying-glass >}} Search** on the top-left.

   To preview what is included in a test, select it. By default, selected tests are previewed.

8. Click **Insert _n_ test results to document** when you are ready.

After you have completed these steps, the new content block becomes a part of your model documentation.

<!--- TO DO We might need to revisit terminology: we talk about "block", "section", and "module", but they all seem to be names for very similar things.--->
### Add mathematical formulas

While editing a simple text block, you can insert math equations using the editor:

1. Click **âˆš** in the toolbar while editing a content block.

2. You can use the interface to type out the equation, or paste in a LaTeX formula:

![](mathtype-full-demo.gif){width=100% fig-alt="An animation that shows how to insert a mathematical formula using LaTex within a simple text block."}

3. Click **Insert** to add the equation to your content block.

::: {.content-hidden when-format="html"}

<!-- As per Nik on PR#233 (https://github.com/validmind/documentation/pull/233) we are hiding this content until we are sure we want to expose the documentation surrounding the Story to users.  When it's ready to be revealed, simply remove this comment and the `.content-hidden` block it's wrapped in. -->

### Generate with AI (BETA)

While editing a simple text block, you can have ValidMind assist you with generating content:

1. Click **{{< fa diamond >}} BETA** in the toolbar while editing a content block.

2. The ValidMind AI Content Builder will generate a draft for your review:

   - Click **{{< fa download >}} Accept Text** to insert the draft into your content block.
   - Click **{{< fa rotate >}} Try Again** to regenerate a different draft.
   - Click **Cancel** to discard the draft and return to your documentation section.

4. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Documentation** or **Validation Report**.

   You can now jump to any section of the model documentation or validation report by expanding the table of contents on the left and selecting the relevant section, such as **1.1 Model Overview**. 

5. Select the block you wish to remove from the model documentation.

6. Click on {{< fa trash-can >}} located in either one of these locations:

   - In the toolbar for text blocks
   
   ![](remove-text-block.gif)

   - In the single-button toolbar for the test-driven block

   ![](remove-test-driven-block.gif)


- After you have completed these steps, the content block is removed. 
- Test-driven blocks can be re-added later on but **text blocks are currently deleted permanently**.
