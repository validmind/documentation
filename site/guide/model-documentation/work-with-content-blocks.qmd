Make edits to your model documentation, validation reports, or ongoing monitoring plans by adding or removing content blocks directly in the online editor. 

## What are content blocks? 

Content blocks provide you with sections that are part of a template, and are used in model documentation, validation reports, and ongoing monitoring plans.

- You can think of these sections as an empty canvas that you fill in with text and test results. 
- Multiple sections are joined to create a longer document with a table of contents that has different heading and subheading levels, such as "1.," "1.1.," and so on. 

#### Content block types

{{< include content_blocks/_simple-text-block.qmd >}}

{{< include content_blocks/_test-driven-block.qmd >}}

{{< include content_blocks/_metric-over-time-block.qmd >}}

### Content editing toolbar

![Content editing toolbar](/guide/model-documentation/content-editing-toolbar.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing the content editing toolbar"}

The content editing toolbar is a rich text editor that enables you to:

- Undo or redo changes
- Format your text, including adding hyperlinks and code blocks
- Insert LaTex formulas[^1]
- Attach images via upload or URL

You can also use the toolbar to suggest changes, save named versions of content, and leave comments.[^2]

<!-- As per Nik on PR#233 (https://github.com/validmind/documentation/pull/233) we are hiding this content until we are sure we want to expose the documentation surrounding the Story to users.  When it's ready to be revealed, simply remove this comment and the `.content-hidden` block it's wrapped in. -->

- [x] You are a `Developer` or `Validator`, or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^4]

## Add content blocks

{{< include /guide/model-documentation/_add-content-block.qmd >}}

5. Click {{< fa square-plus >}} and then select one of the available options: 
    
    - **Text Block** — Adds a new section with a blank content block. After the new content block has been added, click {{< fa pencil >}} to edit the contents of the section like any other.
    - **Test-Driven Block**[^5] — Adds a new section with test results. 
    - **Metric Over Time** — Adds a new section with metric over time results.

6. After adding the block to your documentation, click on the text to make changes or add comments.[^6]

### Add mathematical formulas

While editing a simple text block, you can insert math equations using the editor:

1. Click **√** in the toolbar while editing a content block.

2. You can use the interface to type out the equation, or paste in a LaTeX formula:

3. Click **Insert** to add the equation to your content block.

::: {.content-hidden when-format="html"}

<!-- As per Nik on PR#233 (https://github.com/validmind/documentation/pull/233) we are hiding this content until we are sure we want to expose the documentation surrounding the Story to users.  When it's ready to be revealed, simply remove this comment and the `.content-hidden` block it's wrapped in. -->

### Generate with AI (BETA)

While editing a simple text block, you can have ValidMind assist you with generating content:

1. Click **{{< fa diamond >}} BETA** in the toolbar while editing a content block.

2. The ValidMind AI Content Builder will generate a draft for your review:

   - Click **{{< fa download >}} Accept Text** to insert the draft into your content block.
   - Click **{{< fa rotate >}} Try Again** to regenerate a different draft.
   - Click **Cancel** to discard the draft and return to your documentation section.

## Remove content blocks

1. In the left sidebar, click **Model Inventory**.

2. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^7]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Documentation**, **Validation Report**, or **Ongoing Monitoring**.

   You can now jump to any section of the model documentation or validation report by expanding the table of contents on the left and selecting the relevant section, such as **1.1 Model Overview**. 

4. Select the block you wish to remove from the model documentation.

5. Click on {{< fa trash-can >}} located in either one of these locations:

   - In the toolbar for text blocks
   
   ![Deleting a content block via the text toolbar](remove-text-block.gif){fig-alt="A gif showing the process of deleting a content block via the text toolbar"}

   - In the single-button toolbar for the test-driven block

   ![Deleting a content block via the single-button toolbar for test-driven blocks](remove-test-driven-block.gif){fig-alt="A gif showing the process of deleting a content block via the single-button toolbar for test-driven blocks"}


6. After you confirm, the content block is removed. 

   ::: {.callout-important}
   Test-driven blocks can be re-added later on but **text blocks are currently deleted permanently**.
