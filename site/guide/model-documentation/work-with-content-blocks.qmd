Make edits to your model documentation, validation reports, or ongoing monitoring plans by adding or removing content blocks directly in the online editor. 

## What are content blocks? 

Content blocks provide you with sections that are part of a template, and are used in model documentation, validation reports, and ongoing monitoring plans.

- You can think of these sections as an empty canvas that you fill in with text and test results. 
- Multiple sections are joined to create a longer document with a table of contents that has different heading and subheading levels, such as "1.," "1.1.," and so on. 

#### Content block types

{{< include content_blocks/_simple-text-block.qmd >}}

{{< include content_blocks/_test-driven-block.qmd >}}

{{< include content_blocks/_metric-over-time-block.qmd >}}

### Content editing toolbar

![Content editing toolbar](/guide/model-documentation/content-editing-toolbar.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing the content editing toolbar" class="screenshot"}

The content editing toolbar is a rich text editor that enables you to:

- Undo or redo changes
- Format your text, including adding hyperlinks and code blocks
- Insert LaTex formulas[^1]
- Attach images via upload or URL

You can also use the toolbar to suggest changes, save named versions of content, and leave comments.[^2]

Use ValidMind to assist you with generating content via AI!^[[Generate with AI (BETA)](#generate-text-with-ai-beta)]

::: {.prereq}

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] The model you are documenting or validating is registered in the model inventory.[^3]
- [x] You are a `Developer` or `Validator`, or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^4]

:::

## Add content blocks

{{< include /guide/model-documentation/_add-content-block.qmd >}}

5. Click {{< fa square-plus >}} and then select one of the available options: 
    
    - **Text** — Adds a new section with a blank content block. After the new content block has been added, click {{< fa pencil >}} to edit the contents of the section like any other.
    - **Test-Driven**[^5] — Adds a new section with test results. 
    - **Metric Over Time**[^6] — Adds a new section with metric over time results.

6. After adding the block to your documentation, click on the text to make changes or add comments.[^7]

### Add mathematical formulas

While editing a simple text block, you can insert math equations using the editor:

1. Click **√** in the toolbar while editing a content block.

2. You can use the interface to type out the equation, or paste in a LaTeX formula:

3. Click **Insert** to add the equation to your content block.

### Generate Text with AI <sup>[beta]{.smallcaps}</sup>

While editing a simple text block, you can have ValidMind assist you with generating content drafts:

1. Click **{{< fa diamond >}} <sup>[beta]{.smallcaps}</sup> (Generate Text with AI)** in the toolbar while editing a content block.

2. Enter an optional prompt to guide the output, then click **{{< fa check >}} Generate** to compose a draft for review.  

3. Review the draft composed by the ValidMind AI Content Builder for accuracy and relevance, then:

   - Click **{{< fa download >}} Accept Text** to insert the draft into your content block.
   - Click **{{< fa rotate >}} Try Again** to regenerate a different draft.
   - Click **Cancel** to discard the draft and return to your documentation section. 

4. After you insert the AI-generated draft, click on the text box to make the necessary edits and adjustments to your copy:

   - Ensure that content is in compliance with the quality guidelines outlined by your organization. 
   - Use the content editing toolbar[^8] just as you would with any other text block.

::: {.callout}
When generating content drafts with AI, accepted versions and edits are retained in your Model Activity[^9] just like other updates to your documentation, reports, or plans.

## Remove content blocks

1. In the left sidebar, click **Model Inventory**.

2. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^10]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Documentation**, **Validation Report**, or **Ongoing Monitoring**.

   You can now jump to any section of the model documentation or validation report by expanding the table of contents on the left and selecting the relevant section, such as **1.1 Model Overview**. 

4. Select the block you wish to remove from the model documentation.

5. Click on {{< fa trash-can >}} located in either one of these locations:

   - In the toolbar for text blocks
   
   ![Deleting a content block via the text toolbar](remove-text-block.gif){fig-alt="A gif showing the process of deleting a content block via the text toolbar" class="screenshot"}

   - In the single-button toolbar for test-driven or metric over time blocks

   ![Deleting a content block via the single-button toolbar for test-driven blocks](remove-test-driven-block.gif){fig-alt="A gif showing the process of deleting a content block via the single-button toolbar for test-driven blocks" class="screenshot"}


6. After you confirm, the content block is removed. 

   ::: {.callout-important}
   Test-driven or metric over time blocks can be re-added later on but **text blocks are currently deleted permanently**.
