Make edits to your model documentation, validation reports, or ongoing monitoring plans by adding or removing content blocks directly in the online editor.

## What are content blocks?

Content blocks provide you with sections that are part of a template, and are used in model documentation, validation reports, and ongoing monitoring plans.

- You can think of these sections as an empty canvas that you fill in with text and test results. 
- Multiple sections are joined to create a longer document with a table of contents that has different heading and subheading levels, such as "1.," "1.1.," and so on. 

#### Content block types

{{< include content_blocks/_simple-text-block.qmd >}}

{{< include content_blocks/_test-driven-block.qmd >}}

{{< include content_blocks/_metric-over-time-block.qmd >}}

### Content editing toolbar

![Content editing toolbar](/guide/model-documentation/content-editing-toolbar.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing the content editing toolbar" .screenshot}

The content editing toolbar is a rich text editor that enables you to:

- Undo or redo changes
- Format your text, including adding hyperlinks and code blocks
- Insert LaTex formulas[^1]
- Attach images via upload or URL

You can also use the toolbar to suggest changes, save named versions of content, and leave comments.[^2] 

::: {.callout title="Stuck on where to start?"}
Use {{< var vm.product >}} to assist you with generating content via AI!^[[Generate with AI (BETA)](#generate-text-with-ai-beta)]
:::

::: {.attn}

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] The model you are documenting or validating is registered in the model inventory.[^3]
- [x] You are a [{{< fa code >}} Developer]{.bubble} or [{{< fa circle-check >}} Validator]{.bubble}, or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^4]

:::

## Add content blocks

{{< include /guide/model-documentation/_add-content-block.qmd >}}

6. Click {{< fa square-plus >}} and then select one of the available options:

   a. [new]{.smallcaps}:
      - **Text Block** — Adds a new section with a blank content block.
   b. [from library]{.smallcaps}:
      - **Text Block** — Inserts a text block from a template in your block library.[^5] Select reusable blocks you want to add, then click **Insert # Text Block(s) to Document**.
      - **Test-Driven**[^6] — Adds a new section with logged test results.
      - **Metric Over Time**[^7] — Adds a new section with logged metric over time results.

7. After adding the block to your documentation, click on the text to make changes or add comments.[^8]

### Add mathematical formulas

While editing a simple text block, you can insert math equations using the formula editor:

1. Click **$f(x)$** in the toolbar while editing a content block.

2. Enter your LaTeX formula in the text box and confirm that the Equation preview generates as expected: 

   - To insert the equation inline, leave **Display mode** untoggled.
   - To insert the equation on its own line, toggle **Display mode** on. 

::: {.column-margin}
![Equation preview in the formula editor](equation-preview.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing the equation preview in the formula editor" .screenshot group="latex"}

:::

   ![The two formula display modes](formula-display-modes.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing the two formula display modes" .screenshot group="latex"}

3. Click **[{{< fa check >}}]{.green}** to add the equation to your content block.

### Generate Text with AI <sup>[beta]{.smallcaps}</sup>

::: {.callout title="Have you logged your tests?"}
Generating content drafts for your model documentation works best after you've logged tests and test descriptions for your model's tests with the {{< var validmind.developer >}},[^9] as existing test descriptions provide more context for the large language model (LLM) to draw upon.

:::

While editing a simple text block, you can have {{< var vm.product >}} assist you with generating content drafts:

{{< include content_blocks/_generate-with-ai.qmd >}}

2. Enter an optional prompt to guide the output, then click **{{< fa check >}} Generate** to compose a draft for review.  

3. Review the draft composed by the {{< var vm.product >}} AI Content Builder for accuracy and relevance, then:

   - Click **{{< fa download >}} Accept Text** to insert the draft into your content block.
   - Click **{{< fa rotate >}} Try Again** to regenerate a different draft.g
   - Click **Cancel** to discard the draft and return to your documentation section. 

4. After you insert the AI-generated draft, click on the text box to make the necessary edits and adjustments to your copy:

   - Ensure that content is in compliance with the quality guidelines outlined by your organization. 
   - Use the content editing toolbar[^10] just as you would with any other text block.

![Generating content with AI within a simple text block](generate-with-ai.gif){width=90% fig-alt="An animation that showcases the Generate with AI feature within a simple text block" .screenshot}

When generating content drafts with AI, accepted versions and edits are retained in your {{< fa wifi >}} Model Activity[^11] just like other updates to your documentation, reports, or plans. 


## Remove content blocks

::: {.callout-important}
Test-driven or metric over time blocks can be re-added later on but **text blocks are currently deleted permanently**.
:::

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^12]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **{{< fa book-open >}} Documentation**, **{{< fa shield >}} Validation Report**, or **{{< fa desktop >}} Ongoing Monitoring**.

4. Click on a section header to expand that section and remove content.

5. Select the block you wish to remove from the model documentation.

6. Click on {{< fa trash-can >}} located in either one of these locations:

   - In the toolbar for text blocks
   
   ![Deleting a content block via the text toolbar](remove-text-block.gif){fig-alt="A gif showing the process of deleting a content block via the text toolbar" .screenshot group="delete"}

   - In the single-button toolbar for test-driven or metric over time blocks

   ![Deleting a content block via the single-button toolbar for test-driven blocks](remove-test-driven-block.gif){fig-alt="A gif showing the process of deleting a content block via the single-button toolbar for test-driven blocks" .screenshot group="delete"}


7. After you confirm, the content block is removed.
