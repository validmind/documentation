## Advance model documentation or validation reports in the workflow

For you to be able to transition through the approval workflow, your model documentation or validation report must have completed all required workflow steps. For example, you cannot submit a validation report for review until the model documentation itself has been submitted. 

1. Log in to the {{< var vm_login >}}.

1. In the left sidebar, click **Model Inventory**.
