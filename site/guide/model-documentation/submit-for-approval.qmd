When you're ready, verify your model's status, and then submit your model documentation or validation report for approval.

::: {.prereq}

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] The model you are documenting is registered in the model inventory.[^1]
- [x] The approval workflow has been configured by an administrator.[^2]
- [x] You are a `Developer` or `Validator`, or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^3]

::: {.callout title="To configure workflow states and transitions, you must have sufficient workflow permissions."}
By default, the `Customer Admin` role has these permissions.

## Verify model status

While your lifecycle statuses and workflows are custom to your organization, some examples are:

- `In Documentation` — The model is currently being documented and can be submitted for validation next.
- `In Validation` — The model is currently being validated and can be submitted for review and then approval.

## Advance model status

::: {.callout-important title="For you to be able to transition a model through the approval workflow, you must have completed all the previous required workflow steps. "}
For example, you cannot submit a validation report for review until the model documentation itself has been submitted. 
:::

{{< include /guide/model-workflows/_model-workflows-transition.qmd >}}

While your lifecycle statuses and workflows are custom to your organization, some examples are:

- **To submit model documentation for validation** — Click Ready for Validation to indicate that a model developer has completed the initial model documentation and is ready to have it validated. Add any notes that need to be included and then click Ready for Validation.
- **To submit validation reports for review and approval** — Click Ready for Review to indicate that you have completed your initial model validation report, fill in the mandatory notes, and submit.
- **To request revisions to model documentation or validation reports** — Click Request Revision, fill in the mandatory notes to explain the changes that are required, and submit.
- **To have your model documentation and validation report approved** — Click Ready for Approval, fill in the mandatory notes, and submit.
