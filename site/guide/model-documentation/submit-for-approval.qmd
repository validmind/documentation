When you're ready, verify the approval workflow, and then submit your model documentation or validation report for approval.

## Prerequisites

- You hold the `Developer` or `Validator` role[^1] and are ready to submit your model documentation or validation report for review.
- The model you are documenting is registered in the model inventory.[^2]
- The approval workflow has been configured by an administrator.[^3]

## Advance model documentation or validation reports in the workflow

For you to be able to transition through the approval workflow, your model documentation or validation report must have completed all required workflow steps. For example, you cannot submit a validation report for review until the model documentation itself has been submitted. 

1. [Log into the {{< var validmind_platform >}}](/guide/configuration/log-in-to-validmind.qmd).

1. In the left sidebar, click **Model Inventory**.

{{< include _submit_for_approval_submit.qmd >}}
