## Looking to get started as a model developer?

This section describes how to work with model documentation in the {{< var validmind_platform >}}. Typically, you perform the tasks described here **after you have uploaded some initial model documentation** with the {{< var validmind_developer >}}. 

[Get started with the {{< var validmind_developer >}} {{< fa hand-point-right>}}](/developer/get-started-developer-framework.qmd)

## Prerequisites

- You hold the `Developer` role.[^1]
- The model is already registered in the model inventory.[^2]
- You have provided some content for the documentation, either by uploading it through the {{< var validmind_developer >}}[^3] or via the online UI editor.

## Key concepts

<!-- TO EDIT THESE KEY CONCEPTS, SEE `about/glossary/_model-documentation.qmd` -->
