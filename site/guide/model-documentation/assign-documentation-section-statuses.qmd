::: {.attn}

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] The model is already registered in the model inventory.[^1]
- [x] You are a [{{< fa code >}} Developer]{.bubble} or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^2]

:::

## Steps

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^3]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **{{< fa file >}} Documents** and select a Documentation type file.[^4]

   Jump to any section of the model documentation by selecting the relevant section you would like to view.

4. Next to the heading of each section, you can assign a status from the drop-down:
    - [**In Progress**]{.bubble}
    - [**Done**]{.bubble}

The documentation completion status summary will then be updated on your Document Overview[^5] page.
