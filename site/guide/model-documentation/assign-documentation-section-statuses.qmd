Assign a completion status to individual sections of your model documentation that will be reflected in your Document Overview.

## Prerequisites
- You hold the `Developer` role.[^1]
- The model is already registered in the model inventory.[^2]


## Steps

1. [Log into the {{< var validmind_platform >}}](/guide/log-into-validmind.qmd).

2. In the left sidebar, click **Model Inventory**.

3. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^3]

4. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Documentation**.

   Jump to any section of the model documentation by selecting the relevant section you would like to view.

5. Next to the heading of each section, you can assign a status from the drop-down:
    - In Progress
    - Done

The documentation completion status summary will then be updated on your Document Overview page.
