As a compliance tool, the {{< var vm.checker >}} is most useful when your model documentation is sufficiently complete and you are preparing models for regulatory submission or internal audit, as it helps reduce manual review effort and improve quality assurance.

By default, {{< var vm.product >}} supports the following regulations:

- Federal Reserve Supervisory Letter SR 11-7 (United States)[^1]
- Bank of England Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) Supervisory Statement SS1/23 (United Kingdom)[^2]
- Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) Guideline E-23 (Canada)[^3]
- European Union Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, EU AI Act)[^4]
