Once generated via the {{< var validmind.developer >}}, view and add the test results to your documentation in the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.

::: {.attn}

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] Test results have already been documented via the {{< var validmind.developer >}} for your model.[^1] 
- [x] You are a [{{< fa code >}} Developer]{.bubble} or [{{< fa circle-check >}} Validator]{.bubble}, or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^2]

:::


## Add test results

{{< include /guide/model-documentation/_add-content-block.qmd >}}

5. Click {{< fa square-plus >}} and then select **Test-Driven**.[^3]

    - By default, the [{{< fa code >}} Developer]{.bubble} role can add test-driven blocks within model documentation or ongoing-monitoring plans.
    - By default, the [{{< fa circle-check >}} Validator]{.bubble} role can add test-driven blocks within validation reports. 

6. Select test results:

   - Select the tests to insert into the model documentation from the list of available tests.
   - Search by name using **{{<fa magnifying-glass >}} Search** on the top-left to locate specific test results.

   To preview what is included in a test, click on it. By default, the actively selected test is reviewed.

7. Click **Insert # Test Results to Document** when you are ready.

8. After inserting the results into your document, click on the text to make changes or add comments.[^4]


## View test result metadata

{{< include /guide/model-documentation/_test-result-metadata.qmd >}}

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^5]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **{{< fa book-open >}} Documentation**, **{{< fa shield >}} Validation Report**, or **{{< fa desktop >}} Ongoing Monitoring**.

{{< include /guide/model-documentation/_view-test-result-metadata.qmd >}}

#### Filter historical test results

By default, test result metadata are sorted by date run in descending order. The latest result is automatically indicated as [Active]{.green-bg}. 

To narrow down test runs, you can apply some filters: 

1. On the detail expansion for test result metadata, click **{{< fa filter >}} Filter**.

2. On the **Select Your Filters** dialog that opens, enter your filtering criteria for:

    - Date range
    - Model
    - Dataset
    - Run by

3. Click **Apply Filters**.

Filters can be removed from the list of test result metadata by clicking on the {{< fa xmark >}} next to them.
