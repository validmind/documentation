Use the audit trail functionality in the {{< var validmind.platform >}} to track or audit all the information events associated with a specific model.

## Prerequisites

This topic matters for model developers, model validators, and auditors.

- The model you are documenting is registered in the model inventory.[^1]
- Model documentation has already been created for this project.[^2]
- A model developer has started generating documentation, either using the {{< var vm.developer >}}[^3] or via the online UI editor.

## Steps

1. {{< var link.login >}}

2. In the left sidebar, click **Model Inventory**.
