## Verify the workflow and view current status

1. [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_ui >}}).

2. In the left sidebar, click [**Model Inventory**](https://app.prod.validmind.ai/model-inventory).

3. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.

4. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Documentation**.

   The current status of the project is displayed under **Document Status**. 
   
   For example: 
   
      - `In Documentation` means that the model is currently being documented and can be submitted for validation next. 
      - `In Validation` means that the model is currently being validated and can be submitted for review and then approval.

5. Click **{{< fa arrow-right-arrow-left >}} See workflow** to visualize the entire workflow that this model will go through.

## Advance model documentation or validation reports in the workflow

1. [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_ui >}}).

2. In the left sidebar, click [**Model Inventory**](https://app.prod.validmind.ai/model-inventory).

3. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.

4. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Documentation**.

5. Under **Actions** on the right, initiate the transition from the current state to the next workflow state.

   Examples: 
   
      - **To submit model documentation for validation**: Click `Ready for Validation` to indicate that a model developer has completed the initial model documentation and is ready to have it validated. Add any notes that need to be included and then click **Ready for Validation**.
      - **To submit validation reports for review and approval**: Click `Ready for Review` to indicate that you have completed your initial model validation report, fill in the mandatory notes, and submit.
      - **To request revisions to model documentation or validation reports**: Click **Request Revision**, fill in the mandatory notes to explain the changes that are required, and submit. 
      - **To have your model documentation and validation report approved**: Click **Ready for Approval**, fill in the mandatory notes, and submit. 

   For you to be able to transition through the approval workflow, your model documentation or validation report must have completed all required steps. For example, you cannot submit a validation report for review until the model documentation itself has been submitted.
