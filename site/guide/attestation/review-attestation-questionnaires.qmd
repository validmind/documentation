Review and sign off on attestation questionnaires to verify the accuracy of key model information at a point in time.

As a validator, you assess the model owner's attestation, including ownership, usage, performance, controls, and documentation. You can provide feedback, request changes, and formally sign off to support a traceable and accountable audit trail.

## Review attestation questionnaires

### Before you begin

These steps apply to attestations that are in the [**{{< fa clipboard-check >}} Ready For Review**]{.bubble} state, to be completed by a person who holds [**{{< fa circle-check >}} Validator**]{.bubble} role at the time the attestation snapshot was taken.

   Alternatively, you can access attestations pending your action by clicking **{{< fa clipboard-check >}} Attestations** in these pages:

   - **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**
   - **{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Findings**

2. If shown in the right sidebar, click an attestation instance in the [**{{< fa clipboard-check >}} Ready For Review**]{.bubble} state.

   The attestation questionnaire is now ready to be reviewed in the right sidebar.

3. Optional: Click **{{< fa wifi >}} See Activity** to review:

   - Who completed the different status changes for the attestation.
   - When the attestation status changed.
   - Notes that were provided to document the process.

      If you previously rejected an attestation questionnaire, review the model owner’s response on resubmission.

4. Review the attestation questionnaire:

   - Check all applicable boxes have been checked.
   - Check the answers to each question.
   - Check the comments for accuracy and relevance.

   ::: {.callout}
   Refer to the model snapshot to ensure the attestation questionnaire is accurate:

   - **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory** — Shows model information and recent activity such as comments, status changes, updates and test results.
   - **{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Findings** — Shows model findings with details like title, severity, status, and due date.
   :::

5. Accept or reject the attestation questionnaire:

   - Click **Accept** to record the status change to [**{{< fa clipboard-check >}} Reviewed**]{.bubble} in the [**notes**]{.small-caps} field, then click **Confirm**.
   - Click **Reject** to record the status change back to [**{{< fa clipboard-check >}} In progress**]{.bubble} in the [**notes**]{.small-caps} field, detail the requested changes, then click **Confirm**.

      If you reject an attestation questionnaire, the model owner is prompted to revise the questionnaire and resubmit it. The platform maintains a history of all status changes and notes.

6. If you approved: [Sign off on the attestation](#sign-off-attestations).
