## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] Models registered in the inventory require attestation.[^1]
- [x] If applicable, model artifacts have been documented.[^2]
- [x] You are assigned a role with sufficient permissions to perform attestation tasks:[^3]
   - [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} — Sets up attestations
   - [Submitter]{.bubble} — Stakeholder who submits attestation questionnaires
   - [Reviewer]{.bubble} — Organizational role that reviews attestation questionnaires
   - [Approver]{.bubble} — Organizational role that approves attestation questionnaires

## Key concepts

{{< include /about/glossary/_attestation.qmd >}}

### How does the attestation process work?

Attestation on the {{< var validmind.platform >}} begins at the start of the attestation period after the process has been set up initially. The platform captures a snapshot of each model and its artifacts, preserving the state at that point in time. Changes made after the process starts do not affect the historical record.

Responsibilities for the attestation process are shared:

    subgraph Submitter
        A["**Not Started**"] --> B["**In Progress**"]
        B --> C["**Ready for Review**"]
    end
    
    subgraph Reviewer
        C --> D["**Reviewed**"]
        D -.-> B
    end
    
    subgraph Approver
        D --> E["**Signed Off**"]
    end
```

Attestation participants access their tasks via **{{< fa inbox >}} My Inbox** in the left sidebar. Tasks appear under the **Tasks** tab with the current attestation status, also known as _attestation instances_.

The submitter is responsible for completing the questionnaire and addressing change requests. The reviewer is responsible for reviewing the questionnaire and requesting any necessary changes. The approver is responsible for signing off on the questionnaire.

Plan your attestation periods ahead of time to ensure they can be completed on time. The start date must be today or a future date, and you cannot set a date in the past to trigger attestation retroactively.

### How are attestation submissions organized?

Attestation submissions are organized by owner AND group. This structure supports organizations where:

- Model owners may own models across multiple groups, such as Fraud and Know-Your-Customer (KYC).
- Each group has its own validation and governance team
- Reviewers and approvers are roles scoped to specific groups

::: {.callout title="Example scenario"}
Steven owns 10 models: 4 in the Fraud group and 6 in the KYC group. Emma is the Governance Lead for Fraud, and Fernanda is the Governance Lead for KYC.

If attestations were organized by owner alone, neither Emma nor Fernanda would have permissions to see all of Steven's models. With owner+group organization:

- Steven submits Attestation #1 for his 4 Fraud models → Emma approves
- Steven submits Attestation #2 for his 6 KYC models → Fernanda approves

This approach ensures 100% accountability per group, where Emma approves all Fraud models and Fernanda approves all KYC models. If Fraud has two co-leads (Emma and Andres), either can approve.

## How do I create meaningful attestation questionnaires?

Attestation questionnaires are typically used in model risk management to confirm that key controls, governance processes and documentation requirements have been followed throughout a model's lifecycle. These questionnaires are part of a broader effort to ensure accountability and regulatory compliance. 

Areas typically covered in the questionnaire:

- **Verification of responsibilities** — Attests that model owners, developers and validators have performed their roles in accordance with internal policies and procedures.

- **Documentation of compliance** — Confirms that required documentation — such as model documentation, validation reports and change logs — has been completed and properly archived.

- **Evidence of control operation** — Serves as formal evidence that key controls (for example: backtesting, performance monitoring, version control) are in place and functioning as intended.

- **Governance checkpoints** — Used as checkpoints at critical stages, such as model approval, annual reviews or retirement, to ensure all required steps have been completed before proceeding.

- **Regulatory reporting** — In regulated environments, provides a documented trail that can be reviewed during internal audits or by external regulators.

- **Risk ownership and accountability** — By signing off on questionnaires, individuals acknowledge their responsibilities and support a strong control culture.

Work with your model risk management team to create a template that accurately reflects your organization's attestation requirements.
