[The steps required to set up attestation]{.silver .small}
:::

Setting up attestations involves adding an attestation template and completing the required sections: attestation periods, attestation participants, and questionnaire template. Optionally, you can also set the inventory scope, add attestation fields, start attestation schedules to test the process, and edit or cancel attestation periods.

::: {.attn}

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] Models registered in the inventory require attestation. [^1]
- [x] You are a [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to set up attestations.[^2]

:::

## Add attestation templates

{{< include /guide/attestation/_add-attestations.qmd >}}

{{< include /guide/attestation/_configure-attestations.qmd >}}

## Test attestation schedules

::: {.callout-important title="Not normally required"}
These steps are optional and not required to set up attestation — **perform only under the direction of ValidMind**.
:::

For testing purposes only, you can trigger the attestation process: 

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Workspace, select **Attestation Templates** and then click the attestation template to test.

3. Under **Attestation Periods**, hover over an attestation period.

4. When **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** appears, select **{{< fa play >}} Start Now**.

5. Click **Confirm**.

After starting the schedule, attestation participants are notified via **My Inbox** that the attestation is ready to be completed.

## Edit attestation periods

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Workspace, select **Attestation Templates** and then click the attestation template to edit.

3. Under **Attestation Periods**, hover over an attestation period.

4. When **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** appears, select **{{< fa pencil >}} Edit**.

5. Make your desired changes to the following:

   - **[name]{.smallcaps}**
   - **[start date]{.smallcaps}**
   - **[end date]{.smallcaps}**

6. Click **Save Period**.

Edits to an attestation period will be effective for future occurrences but do not affect previous or in-progress attestation periods.

## Cancel attestation periods

::: {.callout-important title="Canceling an attestation period is permanent"}
This action cannot be undone. The history of previous attestation periods is unaffected by this action.
:::

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Workspace, select **Attestation Templates** and then click the attestation template to manage.

3. Under **Attestation Periods**, hover over an attestation period.

4. When **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** appears, select [**{{< fa trash >}} Cancel Period**]{.red}.

5. Click **Confirm** to cancel the period.

## View attestations dashboard

When an attestation period is active or completed, the **{{< fa clipboard-check >}} Attestations** item appears in the left sidebar. This dashboard provides a centralized view for tracking, reviewing, and exporting attestation data.

::: {.column-margin}
![Attestations dashboard showing progress](attestations-dashboard-progress.png){fig-alt="Attestations dashboard showing swimlane progress view" .screenshot}
:::

To access the dashboard:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa clipboard-check >}} Attestations**.

2. Use the dropdown at the top to select the attestation period to view. You can choose from active periods or view completed historical periods.

The dashboard organizes information across five tabs:

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Progress

The Progress tab displays a swimlane view of all attestation submissions organized by status:

- **Not Started** — Submissions awaiting action from submitters
- **In Progress** — Submissions currently being completed
- **Ready for Review** — Submissions awaiting reviewer action
- **Reviewed** — Submissions awaiting approver sign-off
- **Signed Off** — Completed submissions

Click any submission card to view its details, including the questionnaire responses and associated models.

### Responses

::: {.column-margin}
![Responses tab](attestations-dashboard-responses.png){fig-alt="Attestations dashboard showing consolidated responses" .screenshot}
:::

The Responses tab provides a consolidated view of all questionnaire responses across submissions. Each questionnaire field appears as a column, making it easy to compare responses and identify patterns.

Use this view to:

- Review all submissions at a glance
- Compare responses across different submitters
- Export responses for compliance reporting

### Inventory

::: {.column-margin}
![Inventory snapshot](attestations-dashboard-inventory.png){fig-alt="Attestations dashboard showing inventory snapshot" .screenshot}
:::

The Inventory tab shows a snapshot of all models included in the attestation scope at the time the period started. This provides an organization-wide view of the model inventory state.

Click any model to view its snapshot details in a modal, which displays the model field values captured at that point in time. Click **View Live Data** to navigate to the current model inventory record.

For completed attestation periods, use the **Before** and **After** toggle to compare the model state at the start versus the completion of the period.

![Before and after snapshot comparison](attestations-before-after.png){fig-alt="Before and after toggle for comparing snapshots" .screenshot width=50%}

### Validation Issues

::: {.column-margin}
![Validation Issues tab](attestations-dashboard-validation-issues.png){fig-alt="Attestations dashboard showing validation issues" .screenshot}
:::

The Validation Issues tab shows all validation issues that were open at the time of the snapshot, including:

- Title and artifact ID
- Severity and status
- Associated inventory model
- Risk area, assignee, and due date

### Artifacts

The Artifacts tab displays model artifacts captured in the snapshot, organized by artifact type.

:::

## Export attestation data

Export attestation data in CSV or Excel format for external reporting and compliance documentation.

1. Navigate to the **{{< fa clipboard-check >}} Attestations** dashboard.

2. Select the tab containing the data to export (Progress, Responses, Inventory, Validation Issues, or Artifacts).

3. Click **{{< fa download >}} Export** in the upper right.

4. Choose your preferred format and save the file.

## Complete attestation periods

When all submissions in an attestation period have been signed off, the period is automatically marked as complete. Administrators can also manually complete a period before all submissions are finished.

::: {.callout-important title="Completing a period triggers a final snapshot"}
When a period is completed, the platform captures a final snapshot of all models and artifacts. This enables before/after comparison in the Inventory tab.
:::

::: {.column-margin}
![Complete Period option](attestations-complete-period.png){fig-alt="Complete Period option in attestation settings" .screenshot}
:::

To manually complete an attestation period:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Workspace, select **Attestation Templates** and then click the attestation template.

3. Under **Attestation Periods**, hover over an active attestation period.

4. When **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** appears, select **{{< fa check >}} Complete Period**.

5. Click **Confirm**.

After completing a period, no further actions can be taken on any submissions, regardless of their current status.

## Delete attestation templates

::: {.column-margin}
![Delete template option](attestations-delete-template.png){fig-alt="Delete option for attestation templates" .screenshot}
:::

Remove attestation templates that are no longer needed. When a template is deleted, all related data including schedules, executions, and snapshots is automatically cleaned up.

::: {.callout-important title="Deletion is blocked for active periods"}
You cannot delete an attestation template if it has any active attestation periods. Complete or cancel all active periods before deleting the template.
:::

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Workspace, select **Attestation Templates**.

3. Locate the template to delete and click **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}**.

4. Select [**{{< fa trash >}} Delete**]{.red}.

5. Click **Confirm** to delete the template.
