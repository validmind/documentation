[The steps required to set up attestation]{.silver .small}
:::

Setting up attestations involves adding an attestation template and completing the required sections: attestation periods, attestation participants, and questionnaire template. Optionally, you can also set the inventory scope, add attestation fields, start attestation schedules to test the process, and edit or cancel attestation periods.

::: {.attn}

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] Models registered in the inventory require attestation. [^1]
- [x] You are a [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to set up attestations.[^2]

:::

## Add attestation templates

{{< include /guide/attestation/_add-attestations.qmd >}}

{{< include /guide/attestation/_configure-attestations.qmd >}}

## Test attestation schedules

::: {.callout-important title="Not normally required"}
These steps are optional and not required to set up attestation — **perform only under the direction of ValidMind**.
:::

For testing purposes only, you can trigger the attestation process: 

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Workspace, select **Attestation Templates** and then click the attestation template to test.

3. Under **Attestation Periods**, hover over an attestation period.

4. When **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** appears, select **{{< fa play >}} Start Now**.

5. Click **Confirm**.

After starting the schedule, attestation participants are notified via **My Inbox** that the attestation is ready to be completed.

## Edit attestation periods

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Workspace, select **Attestation Templates** and then click the attestation template to edit.

3. Under **Attestation Periods**, hover over an attestation period.

4. When **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** appears, select **{{< fa pencil >}} Edit**.

5. Make your desired changes to the following:

   - **[name]{.smallcaps}**
   - **[start date]{.smallcaps}**
   - **[end date]{.smallcaps}**

6. Click **Save Period**.

Edits to an attestation period will be effective for future occurrences but do not affect previous or in-progress attestation periods.

## Cancel attestation periods

::: {.callout-important title="Canceling an attestation period is permanent"}
This action cannot be undone. The history of previous attestation periods is unaffected by this action.
:::

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Workspace, select **Attestation Templates** and then click the attestation template to manage.

3. Under **Attestation Periods**, hover over an attestation period.

4. When **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** appears, select [**{{< fa trash >}} Cancel Period**]{.red}.

5. Click **Confirm** to cancel the period.

## View details

View the status and progress of attestation instances for an active attestation period.

::: {.column-margin}
![Attestation details view](attestations-view-details.png){fig-alt="Attestation details view" .screenshot}
:::

To access attestation details:

- From the banner when an attestation period is active: Click **View Details**.
- Under **Attestation Periods**, hover over an attestation period and when **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** appears, select **{{< fa eye >}} View Details**.

The details view shows:

- **Progress chart** — Attestations by status: Not Started, In Progress, Ready For Review, Reviewed, Signed Off
- **Total attestations** — The count of all attestation instances
- **Search** — Filter by group, owner, reviewer, or approver
- **Attestation table** — Columns for Group, Owner, Reviewer, Approver, Status, and Last Updated

Each combination of group and owner creates a separate attestation instance. This allows multiple attestations to run simultaneously, with each submitter responsible for their own group's attestation.
