### Add attestation periods

Attestation periods are typically scheduled quarterly or annually and should be configured to align with regulatory or internal review cycles: 

::: {.column-margin .callout}

### Tips

- **Avoid overlap** — Only one attestation period can be active at a time.
- **Schedule individually** — You cannot schedule recurring attestation periods.

___

Attestation periods reflect the time zone of the user setting up attestation and they trigger in the time zone of the model owner.

:::

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

1. Under Workspace, select **Attestations** and then click an attestation to configure.

1. Click **{{< fa plus >}} Add Attestation Period**.

1. Enter a **[name]{.smallcaps}** for the attestation period, such as `Quarterly attestation`.

1. Set the **[start date]{.smallcaps}** for the attestation period.

1. Set the **[end date]{.smallcaps}** when the attestation period ends.

1. Click **Add Period**.

 When the attestation period begins, the system triggers the process automatically. Model owners are then notified via a banner on their dashboard prompting them to complete the attestation questionnaire.

### Add attestation fields

By default, attestations include the model name. Add additional model inventory fields as needed:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

1. Under Workspace, select **Attestations** and then click an attestation to configure.

1. Under Relevant Attestation Fields, drag model inventory fields between columns:

   - **Model Inventory Fields** — Available fields from the model inventory
   - **Relevant Attestation Fields** — Selected fields to display in model snapshots

1. Optional: Reorder the fields to change how they display in the attestation.

### Edit questionnaire templates

Attestation questionnaires should confirm that key controls, governance processes, and documentation requirements have been followed.

### Tip
