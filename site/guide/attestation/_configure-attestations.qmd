To edit an existing attestation template:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

1. Under Workspace, select **Attestation Templates** and then click an attestation template to edit.

::: {.panel-tabset}

### 1. Add attestation periods

Attestation periods are typically scheduled quarterly or annually and should be configured to align with regulatory or internal review cycles: 

::: {.column-margin .callout}

### Tips

- **Avoid overlap** — Only one attestation period can be active at a time.
- **Schedule individually** — You cannot schedule recurring attestation periods.

___

Attestation periods reflect the time zone of the user setting up attestation and they trigger in the time zone of the submitter.

:::

a. Click **{{< fa plus >}} Add Attestation Period**.

b. Enter a **[name]{.smallcaps}** for the attestation period, such as `Quarterly attestation`.

c. Set the **[start date]{.smallcaps}** for the attestation period.

d. Set the **[end date]{.smallcaps}** when the attestation period ends.

e. Optional: Toggle **[email reminders]{.smallcaps}** to send reminders to Submitters, Reviewers, and Approvers:

   - **[days before end]{.smallcaps}** — How many days before the end date to send the reminder.
   - **[subject]{.smallcaps}** — The email subject line.
   - **[body]{.smallcaps}** — The email body with dynamic variables.

   Available template variables: `{{Recipient Name}}`, `{{Attestation Name}}`, `{{Reminder Reason}}`, `{{Start Date}}`, `{{End Date}}`, `{{Schedule Name}}`, `{{Status Text}}`.

f. Click **Add Period**.

When the attestation period begins, the system triggers the process automatically. Attestation participants are then notified via a banner on their dashboard prompting them to complete their attestation tasks.

### 2. Assign attestation participants

Assign users and roles responsible for this attestation. Each participant type has a specific responsibility in the attestation workflow:

::: {.column-margin .callout}

### Stakeholder versus role

- **Submitter** — A model stakeholder assigned directly to a model
- **Reviewer** — A role responsible for reviewing attestations within their assigned groups
- **Approver** — A role responsible for approving attestations within their assigned groups

___

Attestation submissions are organized by owner and group. This approach ensures reviewers and approvers have appropriate permissions for models in their groups.
:::

a. Under Attestation Participants, select the **[submitter]{.smallcaps}** from the model stakeholders dropdown:

   - Model Owner
   - Model Developer
   - Model Validator

b. Select the **[reviewer]{.smallcaps}** from the roles dropdown.

c. Select the **[approver]{.smallcaps}** from the roles dropdown.

d. Click **Save**.

### 3. Set inventory scope

Define which models are included in the attestation process. By default, all models are included. Use filters to narrow the scope based on model fields, stages, or custom attributes.

a. Under Inventory Scope, click **{{< fa plus >}} Add Rule** to add a filter condition.

{{< include /guide/shared/_select-your-filters.qmd >}}

b. Click **Save**.

c. Optional: Click **See Models** to preview which models match your filter criteria.

### 4. Add attestation fields

By default, attestations include the model name. Add additional model inventory fields as needed:

a. Under Relevant Attestation Fields, drag model inventory fields between columns:

   - **Model Inventory Fields** — Available fields from the model inventory
   - **Relevant Attestation Fields** — Selected fields to display in model snapshots

b. Optional: Reorder the fields to change how they display in the attestation.

### 5. Edit questionnaire templates

Attestation questionnaires should confirm that key controls, governance processes, and documentation requirements have been followed. 

::: {.column-margin .callout}

### Tip

Work with your model risk management team to create a template that accurately reflects your organization's attestation requirements.
