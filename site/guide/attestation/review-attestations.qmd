Review attestation questionnaires to verify the accuracy of key model information at a point in time.

1. Access the attestation for review using one of these methods:

   - In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa clipboard-check >}} Attestations**, then click on the submission in the **Ready for Review** column.
   - In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa inbox >}} My Inbox**, then under Tasks, locate the attestation with a **Ready For Review** status.

2. Review the submitter's questionnaire responses displayed on the right side of the screen.

3. Review the model context using the tabs on the left:

   - **Inventory** — Shows the models included in the attestation with snapshot details.
   - **Validation Issues** — Shows open validation issues at the time of the snapshot.
   - **Artifacts** — Shows model artifacts captured in the snapshot.

4. Optional: Click **Activity** to review the attestation history:

   - Who completed the different status changes.
   - When the attestation status changed.
   - Notes provided to document the process.

   If you previously rejected an attestation, review the submitter's updated responses on resubmission.

5. Accept or reject the attestation:

   - Click **Accept** to approve the submission and advance it to the approver.
   - Click **Reject** to return the submission to the submitter for revisions.

   If you reject an attestation, the submitter is prompted to revise their responses and resubmit. The platform maintains a history of all status changes.

After you accept the questionnaire, it is sent to the approver for final sign-off.[^5]
