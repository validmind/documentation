Review attestation questionnaires to verify the accuracy of key model information at a point in time.

   - **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory** — Shows model information and recent activity such as comments, status changes, updates and test results.
   - **{{< fa border-all >}} Artifacts** — Shows model artifacts with details like title, severity, status, and due date.

6. Accept or reject the attestation questionnaire:

   - Click **Accept** to record the status change to [**{{< fa clipboard-check >}} Reviewed**]{.bubble} in the [**notes**]{.small-caps} field, then click **Confirm**.
   - Click **Reject** to record the status change back to [**{{< fa clipboard-check >}} In progress**]{.bubble} in the [**notes**]{.small-caps} field, detail the requested changes, then click **Confirm**.

      If you reject an attestation questionnaire, the submitter is prompted to revise the questionnaire and resubmit it. The platform maintains a history of all status changes and notes.

After you accept the questionnaire, it is sent to the approver for final sign-off.[^5]
