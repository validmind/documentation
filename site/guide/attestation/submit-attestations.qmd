Certify the accuracy of key model information at a point in time by submitting the attestation questionnaire.

As a submitter, this process is part of the audit trail for your model's information, supporting accountability across its lifecycle. Attestation typically includes details about ownership, usage, performance, controls, and documentation.

1. Access your attestation task using one of these methods:

   - In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa clipboard-check >}} Attestations**, then click on your submission in the **Not Started** column.
   - In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa inbox >}} My Inbox**, then under **Tasks**, locate the attestation with a **Not Started** status.

2. Click **Start Attestation**.

   After you start the attestation, the questionnaire fields are available to complete.

3. Review the model context using the tabs on the left side of the screen:

   - **Inventory** — Shows the models included in your attestation with snapshot details
   - **Validation Issues** — Shows open validation issues for your models at the time of the snapshot
   - **Artifacts** — Shows model artifacts captured in the snapshot

4. Complete the attestation questionnaire by filling in each field. Required fields are marked with an asterisk (*).

   ::: {.callout}
   Click on any model in the Inventory tab to view its snapshot details. Use the **View Live Data** link to navigate to the current model record if you need additional context.
   :::

5. Verify that your answers are complete and click **Submit for Review**.

After you submit, the attestation is sent to your reviewer.

After you confirm the status change, the attestation questionnaire is sent to your reviewer.

If your reviewer rejects your attestation questionnaire, you will need to revise your responses and resubmit for review. The platform maintains a history of all status changes and notes.
