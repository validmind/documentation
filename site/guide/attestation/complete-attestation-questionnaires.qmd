Certify the accuracy of key model information at a point in time by completing the attestation questionnaire.

As a model owner, this process is part of the audit trail for your model's information, supporting accountability across its lifecycle. Attestation typically includes details about ownership, usage, performance, controls, and documentation.

When prompted on your dashboard:

::: {.column-margin .mt6}

1. Click **Open Attestations {{< fa arrow-right >}}**:

   ![Dashboard prompt for attestations](attestation-banner.png){width="90%" fig-alt="Attestation prompt with a link to the attestation labelled 'Open Attestations'" .screenshot}

   Alternatively, you can access attestations pending your action by clicking **Attestations** in these pages:

   - **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**
   - **{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Findings**

2. In the right sidebar:

   - If shown, click an attestation instance in the [**{{< fa clipboard-check >}} Not Started**]{.bubble} state.
   - Click **Start Attestation**.

3. Document the status change to [**{{< fa clipboard-check >}} In Progress**]{.bubble} in the [**notes**]{.small-caps} field and click **Confirm**.

   After you confirm the status change to [**{{< fa clipboard-check >}} In Progress**]{.bubble}, the attestation questionnaire is ready to be completed in the right sidebar.

4. Complete the attestation questionnaire, including:

   - Checking all applicable boxes
   - Answering each question 
   - Adding relevant comments

   ::: {.callout}
   Refer to the model snapshot to ensure the attestation questionnaire is accurate:

   - **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory** — Shows model information and recent activity such as comments, status changes, updates and test results.
   - **{{< fa triangle-exclamation >}} Findings** — Shows model findings with details like title, severity, status, and due date.
   :::

5. Verify that your answers are complete and click **Submit for Review**.

6. Document the status change in the [**notes**]{.small-caps} field for your reviewer and click **Confirm**.

After you confirm the status change, the attestation questionnaire is sent to your reviewer to be completed, typically someone with the [{{< fa circle-check >}} Validator]{.bubble} role or another role with sufficient permissions.

If your reviewer rejects your attestation questionnaire, you will need to revise your responses and resubmit for review. The platform maintains a history of all status changes and notes.
