[The steps required to set up attestation]{.silver .small}
:::

Setting up attestations involves adding an attestation, configuring the attestation period, adding custom fields, and editing the questionnaire template. Optionally, you can also execute the attestation schedule to test the process, and edit or remove attestation periods.

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] Models registered in the inventory require attestation. [^1]
- [x] You are a [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to set up attestations.[^2]

## Add attestations

## Configure attestations

{{< include /guide/attestation/_configure-attestations.qmd >}}

## Test attestation schedules

::: {.callout-important title="Not normally required"}
These steps are optional and not required to set up attestation — **perform only under the direction of ValidMind**.
:::

For testing purposes only, you can trigger the attestation process: 

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Workspace, select **Attestations** and then click the attestation to test.

3. Under **Scheduling**, hover over an attestation period.

4. When **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** appears, select **{{< fa play >}} Execute Schedule**.

5. Click **Confirm**.

After executing the schedule, the dashboard of the model owner displays a banner notification that the attestation is ready to be completed.

## Edit attestation periods

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Workspace, select **Attestations** and then click the attestation period to edit.

3. Under **Scheduling**, hover over an attestation period.

4. When **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** appears, select **{{< fa pencil >}} Edit**.

5. Make your desired changes to the following:

   - **[name]{.smallcaps}**
   - **[start date]{.smallcaps}**
   - **[end date]{.smallcaps}**

6. Click **Save Period**.

Edits to an attestation period will be effective for future occurrences but do not affect previous or in-progress attestation periods.

## Remove attestation periods

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Workspace, select **Attestations** and then click the attestation to remove.

3. Under **Scheduling**, hover over an attestation period.

4. When **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** appears, select [**{{< fa trash >}} Remove**]{.red}.

5. Click **Delete** to confirm the removal.

<!-- TO DO Confirm with Steven that this is correct -->
::: {.callout-important title="Removing an attestation period is permanent"}
This action cannot be undone and prevents the attestation period from being triggered in the future. The history of previous attestation periods is unaffected by this action.
