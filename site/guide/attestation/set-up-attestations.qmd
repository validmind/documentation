[The steps required to set up attestation]{.silver .small}
:::

Setting up attestations involves adding an attestation, configuring the attestation period, adding custom fields, and editing the questionnaire template. Optionally, you can also execute the attestation schedule to test the process, and edit or remove attestation periods.

::: {.attn}

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] Models registered in the inventory require attestation. [^1]
- [x] You are a [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to set up attestations.[^2]

:::

## Add attestations

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings** > **{{< fa clipboard-check >}}  Attestations**.

2. Click **{{< fa plus >}} Add New Attestation**.

3. Enter a name for the attestation.

4. Enter a description.

5. Click **Add Attestation**.

6. [Configure the attestation](#configure-attestations).

## Configure attestations

### Add attestation periods

Attestation periods are typically scheduled quarterly or annually and should be configured to align with regulatory or internal review cycles: 

::: {.column-margin .callout}

### Tips

- **Avoid overlap** — Only one attestation period can be active at a time.
- **Schedule individually** — You cannot schedule recurring attestation periods.

<!-- TO DO: Confirm with Steven -->
Attestation periods reflect the time zone of the user setting up attestation and they trigger in the time zone of the model owner. 

:::

1. Under **{{< fa gear >}} Settings** > **{{< fa clipboard-check >}}  Attestations**, click an attestation to configure.

2. Click **{{< fa plus >}} Add Attestation Period**.

3. Enter a name for the attestation period, such as `Quarterly attestation`.

4. Set the start date for the attestation period.

5. Set the end date when the attestation period ends.

6. Click **Add Period**.

 When the attestation period begins, the system triggers the process automatically. Model owners are then notified via a banner on their dashboard prompting them to complete the attestation questionnaire.

### Add attestation fields

By default, attestations include the model name. Add additional model inventory fields as needed:

1. Under **{{< fa gear >}} Settings** > **{{< fa clipboard-check >}}  Attestations**, click an attestation to configure.

2. Under **Relevant Attestation Fields**, drag model inventory fields between columns:

   - **Model Inventory Fields** — Available fields from the model inventory
   - **Relevant Attestation Fields** — Selected fields to display in model snapshots

3. Optional: Reorder the fields to change how they display in the attestation.

### Edit questionnaire templates

Attestation questionnaires should confirm that key controls, governance processes, and documentation requirements have been followed. 

::: {.column-margin .callout}

### Tip

Work with your model risk management team to create a template that accurately reflects your organization's attestation requirements.

:::

1. Under **{{< fa gear >}} Settings** > **{{< fa clipboard-check >}}  Attestations**, click the attestation you want to configure.

2. Under **Questionnaire Template**, click the template area to edit. You can add rich text fields such as:

   - Instructions 
   - Links to guidelines
   - Checkboxes
   - Lists 
   - Other custom elements

   ![A screenshot of the questionnaire template editor](edit-questionnaire-template.gif){width=100% fig-alt="An animation of the questionnaire template editor showing the process of adding a question about documentation of compliance to the template with the instructions to confirm that required documentation, such as model documentation, validation reports, and change logs, has been completed." .screenshot}

3. After you complete your edits, click **Save**.

The attestation questionnaire is now ready to be be used in future attestation instances, to be completed by model owners and reviewed and signed off by validators.

## Test attestation schedules

::: {.callout-important title="Not normally required"}
These steps are optional and not required to set up attestation — **perform only under the direction of ValidMind**.
:::

For testing purposes only, you can trigger the attestation process: 

1. Under **{{< fa gear >}} Settings** > **{{< fa clipboard-check >}}  Attestations**, click the attestation to test.

2. Under **Scheduling**, click **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** and select **Execute Schedule**.

3. Click **Confirm**.

After executing the schedule, the dashboard of the model owner displays a banner notification that the attestation is ready to be completed.

## Edit attestation periods

1. Under **{{< fa gear >}} Settings** > **{{< fa clipboard-check >}}  Attestations**, click the attestation period to edit.

2. Under **Scheduling**, click **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** and select **Edit**.

3. Make changes to one of the following:

   - Name
   - Start date
   - End date

4. Click **Save Period**.

Edits to an attestation period will be effective for future occurrences but do not affect previous or in-progress attestation periods.

## Remove attestation periods

1. Under **{{< fa gear >}} Settings** > **{{< fa clipboard-check >}}  Attestations**, click the attestation to remove.

2. Under **Scheduling**, click **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** and select **Remove**.

3. Click **Delete** to confirm the removal.

<!-- TO DO Confirm with Steven that this is correct -->
::: {.callout-important title="Removing an attestation period is permanent"}
This action cannot be undone and prevents the attestation period from being triggered in the future. The history of previous attestation periods is unaffected by this action.
