ValidMind is a model risk management (MRM) solution designed for the specific needs of model developers and model validators alike. The platform automates key aspects of the MRM process, including model documentation, validation, and testing. In addition, the platform comes with built-in communication and tracking features that enable all stakeholders to collaborate and communicate effectively throughout the model risk management process, ensuring that everyone is informed and up-to-date.

Model Documentation Automation
: The platform enables the automation of model documentation using configurable documentation templates and model test plans. The automation helps ensure all necessary information is captured and recorded consistently and accurately and reduces the risk of errors or omissions in the documentation.  In addition, this helps streamline the MRM process and reduce the amount of time and resources required to produce documentation while increasing confidence in the accuracy and reliability of the models.

Communication and tracking
: The MRM platform comes with built-in functionality for communicating and tracking communication between stakeholders. It offers an effective way of communication that helps ensure all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the models being used, their limitations, and the potential risks associated with their use. The built-in communication facilitates collaboration between stakeholders and by working together, stakeholders can develop effective strategies for managing model risk and ensuring the models are used appropriately.

MRM lifecycle and workflow
: The MRM platform helps manage your model lifecycle and provides a configurable MRM workflow that simplifies management and control over the model risk management process. You can customize the workflow to fit your organization's needs and requirements, providing a structured approach to identify and manage the risks associated with its models, and enhance stakeholder confidence in its ability to manage risk.

One component is the developer framework that integrates with your existing data infrastructure and data science or model developer stack. The other component is the platform which the developer framework sends data to."}

Our solution comprises two primary product components: the locally-run _developer framework_ and the _cloud-hosted platform_, seamlessly integrating the two with your existing infrastructure and software stack. 

### ValidMind developer framework

<!--- NR Add some visual representation of the developer framework here --->

The ValidMind developer framework is designed to offer model developers a systematic approach to documenting and testing risk models with repeatability and consistency. We not only streamline the process of generating documentation for algorithmic models, but also help you proactively identify potential risks in both traditional and machine-learning models through rigorous testing.

The framework consists of our versatile ValidMind Python client library, API endpoints for models and testing, and validation tests that streamline the model development process. Implemented as a series of independent libraries in Python and R, our framework ensures compatibility and flexibility with diverse developer environments and requirements.

With the developer framework, you can:

- **Automate documentation** — Add comprehensive documentation as metadata while you build models to be shared with model validators on the ValidMind platform, streamlining and speeding up the process.
- **Run test plans** — Identify potential risks for a diverse range of statistical and AI/ML models by assessing data quality, model outcomes, robustness, and explainability. Extend the framework with your own tests.
- **Integrate with your stack** — Seamlessly incorporate the framework into your existing model development environment, connecting to your existing model code and data sets.
- **Customize the framework** — Extend the framework to include your own test suites and model templates, tailoring it to your own specific needs.
- **Upload to our platform** — Send model documentation and qualitative and quantitative test data to our platform for review and approval, fostering effective collaboration with model validators.

### ValidMind platform

<!--- NR Add some visual representation of the platform UI here --->

The ValidMind platform provides a comprehensive suite of tools, guidelines, and best practices. You use the platform to review and evaluate models and model documentation to ensure they comply with organizational and regulatory requirements.

The platform employs a multi-tenant architecture, hosting the cloud-based user interface, APIs, databases, and internal services. The design ensures efficient resource utilization and offers a highly scalable solution for organizations of varying sizes.


With the ValidMind platform, you can:

- **Track your model inventory** — Manage the model lifecycle, track the workflow status for models, plan for upcoming validation dates, and more.
- **Work on validation projects** — Collaborate with developers and validators to review documentation, add findings, keep track of review statuses, and generate validation reports.
- **Configure workflows** — Set up ValidMind to follow your existing model risk management processes, manage statuses for different parts of the workflow, and get an end-to-end view of workflows and who is involved.
- **Work with templates** — Configure required validation tests and standardize the documentation table of contents for specific model use cases.
- **Integrate with your stack** — Import and export model documentation and validation reports.

We also provide support for AWS PrivateLink, ensuring a secure connection between ValidMind and your company network while keeping traffic shielded from the public internet.
