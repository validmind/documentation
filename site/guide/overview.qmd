Our solution comprises two primary product components: the locally-run developer framework and the cloud-hosted software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform, seamlessly integrating the two with your existing infrastructure and software stack. 

### Developer framework

The ValidMind developer framework provides a comprehensive suite of tools, guidelines, and best practices, designed to offer model developers a systematic approach to documenting and testing risk models. We not only streamline the process of generating documentation for algorithmic models, but also help you proactively identify potential risks in both traditional and machine-learning models through rigorous testing.

With the developer framework, you can:

- **Automate documentation** — Generate comprehensive documentation as you built models, streamlining and speeding up the process.
- **Run tests** — Run test suites on a wide range of models utilized in financial services, including statistical and AI/ML models. Additionally, you have the flexibility to extend the framework with your own custom tests.
- **Integrate with your stack** — Seamlessly incorporate the framework into your existing model development environment, connecting to your existing model code and data sets.
- **Customize the framework** — Extend the framework to include your own test suites and model templates, tailoring it to your own specific needs.
- **Upload to our SaaS platform** — Send model documentation and test reports to our SaaS platform for review and approva, fostering effective collaboration with model validators.

The developer framework incorporates our versatile Python library, intuitive APIs, and a variety of other software components that streamline the model development process. Implemented as a series of independent libraries in both Python and R, it ensures compatibility and flexibility with diverse developer environments and requirements.

### SaaS platform

The SaaS platform employs a multi-tenant architecture, hosting the cloud-based user interface, APIs, databases, and various internal services. We also provide support for AWS PrivateLink, ensuring a secure connection between ValidMind and your company network while keeping traffic shielded from the public internet.

Repeatability and consistency

With the Saas platform, you can:

- **Collaborate with developers and validators** — Communication/feedback. Continuous information feed between model development & validation teams. Avoid bottlenecks and endless email back-and-forth.
- **Manage** — Content management
- **Review** Online UI editor, Generate validation report
- **Generate validation reports**
