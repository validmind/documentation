The ValidMind platform is a suite of tools helping data scientists and risk & compliance stakeholders identify potential risks in their AI and large language models, and generate robust, high-quality model documentation that meets regulatory requirements. The platform is adept at handling many use cases, including models compatible with the Hugging Face Transformers API, and GPT 3.5, GPT 4, and hosted LLama2 and Falcon-based models (focused on text classification and text summarization use cases).

In addition to LLMs, ValidMind can also handle testing and documentation generation for a wide variety of models, including:

- Traditional machine learning models (ML), such as tree-based models and neural networks
- Natural language processing models (NLP)
- Traditional statistical models, such as OLS regression, logistic regression, time series, etc.
- And many more model types

What sets ValidMind apart is its focus on simplifying complex tasks for both model developers and validators. By automating critical aspects of the model lifecycle, such as documentation, validation, and testing, we enable model developers to concentrate on building better models. 

We do all of this while making it easy to align with regulatory guidelines on model risk management in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. These regulations include the Federal Reserve's SR 11-7, the UK's CP6/22, and Canada's Guideline E-23.

As the 1st line of defense against model risk, model developers have a strong incentive and obligation to document and test the models they build, especially when they are subject to regulations. As the 2nd line of defense, model validators must independently validate models and ensure the firm's model risk management principles are implemented at all stages of the model lifecycle.

To achieve this purpose, ValidMind provides different tools for developers to document and validate models regardless of the technology platform used to build them. 

Model documentation provides a comprehensive record and description of a quantitative model. This documentation should encompass all relevant information about the model in accordance with:

- Regulatory requirements, as set by regulatory bodies
- Model risk policies, as set by your institution
- Assumptions
- Methodologies
- Data and inputs
- Model performance evaluation
- Limitations
- Intended use

The purpose of model documentation is to provide transparency, facilitate understanding, and enable effective governance and oversight of the model.

## ValidMind Benefits

Model Documentation Automation
: The platform enables the automation of model documentation using configurable documentation templates and model test suites. The automation helps ensure all necessary information is captured and recorded consistently and accurately and reduces the risk of errors or omissions in the documentation.  In addition, this helps streamline the model lifecycle and reduce the amount of time and resources required to produce documentation while increasing confidence in the accuracy and reliability of the models.

Communication and tracking
: The AI risk platform comes with built-in functionality for communicating and tracking communication between stakeholders. It offers an effective way of communication that helps ensure all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the models being used, their limitations, and the potential risks associated with their use. The built-in communication facilitates collaboration between stakeholders and by working together, stakeholders can develop effective strategies for managing model risk and ensuring the models are used appropriately.

Model risk management lifecycle and workflow
: The AI risk platform helps manage your model lifecycle and provides a configurable workflow that simplifies management and control over the model risk management process. You can customize the workflow to fit your organization's needs and requirements, providing a structured approach to identify and manage the risks associated with its models, and enhance stakeholder confidence in its ability to manage risk. 

## What products do we offer?

![The ValidMind Platform](platform-overview.png){width=70% fig-align="center" fig-alt="An image showing the two main components of ValidMind. The Developer Framework that integrates with your existing developer environment, and the ValidMind AI risk platform."}

Our solution comprises two primary architectural components: the ValidMind Developer Framework and the cloud-based ValidMind platform.

### ValidMind Developer Framework

<!--- NR Add some visual representation of the Developer Framework here --->

The ValidMind Developer Framework is designed to offer model developers a systematic approach to documenting and testing risk models with repeatability and consistency. The Developer Framework streamlines the process of generating documentation for AI/ML and algorithmic models, helping you proactively identify potential risks through rigorous testing.

The Developer Framework consists of a client-side library, API endpoints for models and testing, and validation tests that streamline the model development process. Implemented as a series of independent libraries in Python and R, our framework ensures compatibility and flexibility with diverse set of developer environments and requirements.

With the Developer Framework, you can:

- **Automate documentation** — Add comprehensive documentation as metadata while you build models to be shared with model validators, streamlining and speeding up the process.
- **Run test suites** — Identify potential risks for a diverse range of statistical and AI/LLM/ML models by assessing data quality, model outcomes, robustness, and explainability.
- **Integrate with your development environment** — Seamlessly incorporate the framework into your existing model development environment, connecting to your existing model code and data sets.
- **Upload documentation data** — Send qualitative and quantitative test data to the AI risk platform to generate the model documentation for review and approval, fostering effective collaboration with model reviewers and validators.

### ValidMind AI Risk Platform

<!--- NR Add some visual representation of the platform UI here --->

The ValidMind Platform provides a comprehensive suite of tools, guidelines, and best practices. You use the platform to review and evaluate models and model documentation to ensure they comply with organizational and regulatory requirements.

The platform employs a multi-tenant architecture, hosting the cloud-based user interface, APIs, databases, and internal services. The design ensures efficient resource utilization and offers a highly scalable solution for organizations of varying sizes.

With the ValidMind Platform, you can:

- **Track your model inventory** — Manage the model lifecycle, track the workflow status for models, plan for upcoming validation dates, and more.
- **Work on validation projects** — Collaborate with developers and validators to review documentation, add findings, keep track of review statuses, and generate validation reports.
- **Configure workflows** — Set up ValidMind to follow your existing model risk management processes, manage statuses for different parts of the workflow, and get an end-to-end view of workflows and who is involved.
- **Use, create, or edit tests, test suites, and templates** — Create and/or configure required validation tests, test suites, and documentation templates for specific model use cases, tailoring it to your own specific needs.
- **Integrate with your stack** — Import and export model documentation and validation reports.
