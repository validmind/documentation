Our solution comprises two primary product components: the locally-run_ developer framework_ and the cloud-hosted _software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform_, seamlessly integrating the two with your existing infrastructure and software stack. 

### Developer framework

The ValidMind developer framework is designed to offer model developers a systematic approach to documenting and testing risk models with repeatability and consistency. We not only streamline the process of generating documentation for algorithmic models, but also help you proactively identify potential risks in both traditional and machine-learning models through rigorous testing.

The framework consists of our versatile ValidMind Python client library, API endpoints for models and testing, and validation tests that streamline the model development process. Implemented as a series of independent libraries in Python and R, our framework ensures compatibility and flexibility with diverse developer environments and requirements.

With the developer framework, you can:

- **Automate documentation** — Add comprehensive documentation as metadata while you build models to be shared with model validators on the ValidMind SaaS platform, streamlining and speeding up the process.
- **Run test plans** — Evaluate and validate model performance across a diverse range of statistical and AI/ML models, including assessing data quality, model outcomes, robustness, and explainability. Identify potential risks, such as biases in the training data or lack of robustness to changes in input data, enabling developers to refine the model or modify testing procedures. This comprehensive approach ensures that models meet the required standards. Additionally, you have the flexibility to extend the framework with your own custom tests.
- **Integrate with your stack** — Seamlessly incorporate the framework into your existing model development environment, connecting to your existing model code and data sets.
- **Customize the framework** — Extend the framework to include your own test suites and model templates, tailoring it to your own specific needs.
- **Upload to our SaaS platform** — Send model documentation and qualitative and quantitative test data to our SaaS platform for review and approval, fostering effective collaboration with model validators.

### SaaS platform

The ValidMind SaaS platform provides a comprehensive suite of tools, guidelines, and best practices. You use the platform to review and evaluate models and model documentation to ensure they comply with organizational and regulatory requirements.

The SaaS platform employs a multi-tenant architecture, hosting the cloud-based user interface, APIs, databases, and internal services. The design ensures efficient resource utilization and offers a highly scalable solution for organizations of varying sizes.


With the Saas platform, you can:

- **Track your model inventory** — Manage the model lifecycle, track the workflow status for models, plan for upcoming validation dates, and more.
- **Work on validation projects** — Collaborate with developers and validators to review documentation, add findings, keep track of review statuses, and generate validation reports.
- **Configure workflows** — Set up ValidMind to follow your existing model risk management processes, manage statuses for different parts of the workflow, and get an end-to-end view of workflows and who is involved.
- **Work with templates** — Configure required validation tests and standardize the documentation table of contents for specific model use cases.
- **Integrate with your stack** — Import and export model documentation and validation reports.

We also provide support for AWS PrivateLink, ensuring a secure connection between ValidMind and your company network while keeping traffic shielded from the public internet.
