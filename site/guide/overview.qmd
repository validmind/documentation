ValidMind is a solution for model risk management (MRM) that enables financial institutions to increase the speed and efficiency of model documentation and validation. 

Our solution consists of two major product components: the _developer framework_ and the _software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform_ in the cloud:

### Developer framework

Geared towards model developers, the developer framework provides a comprehensive suite of tools, guidelines, and best practices, designed to offer developers a systematic approach to documenting and testing risk models. 

This framework not only streamlines the process of generating documentation for algorithmic models but also proactively identifies potential risks in both traditional and machine-learning models through rigorous testing.

Essential workflow features:

- **Integrate** — Seamlessly incorporate the framework into your existing model development environment, connecting to your model code and data sets.
- **Automate** — Generate comprehensive documentation as you built models, streamlining the process.
- **Test** — Execute test suites on a wide range of models utilized in financial services, including statistical and AI/ML models. Additionally, you have the flexibility to extend the framework with your own custom tests.
- **Customize** — Expand the framework to include your own test suites and model templates, tailoring it to your specific needs.
- **Collaborate** — Effortlessly send model documentation and test reports to our SaaS platform, fostering effective collaboration with model validators.

The developer framework incorporates our versatile Python library, intuitive APIs, and a variety of other software components that streamline the model development process. Implemented as a series of independent libraries in both Python and R, it ensures compatibility and flexibility with diverse developer environments and requirements.

### SaaS platform

Cloud UI 
increases the speed and efficiency of model validation activities for Financial Institutions
 
Fast & Collaborative — ValidMind ensures continuous information feed between model development & validation teams. Avoid bottlenecks and endless email back-and-forth.

Essential workflow features:

Compliance by Design
: By embedding MRM directly into the model lifecycle, ValidMind ensures model compliance by design.

Access via Web Browser (Secure connection via AWS PrivateLink)

The SaaS platform implements a multi-tenant architecture to host its SaaS components (application, APIs, databases, and other internal services). 

Connection to ValidMind’s SaaS platform supports AWS PrivateLink to establish a private connection between ValidMind and your company network without exposing traffic to the public internet.
