The ValidMind platform is a suite of tools helping developers, data scientists and risk & compliance stakeholders identify potential risks in their AI and large language models, and generate robust, high-quality model documentation that meets regulatory requirements. The platform is adept at handling many use cases, including models compatible with the Hugging Face Transformers API, and GPT 3.5, GPT 4, and hosted LLama2 and Falcon-based models (focused on text classification and text summarization use cases).

In addition to LLMs, ValidMind can also handle testing and documentation generation for a wide variety of models, including:

- Traditional machine learning models (ML), such as tree-based models and neural networks
- Natural language processing models (NLP)
- Traditional statistical models, such as OLS regression, logistic regression, time series, etc.
- And many more model types

What sets ValidMind apart is its focus on simplifying complex tasks for both model developers and validators. By automating critical aspects of the model lifecycle, such as documentation, validation, and testing, we enable model developers to concentrate on building better models. 

We do all of this while making it easy to align with regulatory guidelines on model risk management in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. These regulations include the Federal Reserve's SR 11-7, the UK's CP6/22, and Canada's Guideline E-23.

As the 1st line of defense against model risk, model developers have a strong incentive and obligation to document and test the models they build, especially when they are subject to regulations. As the 2nd line of defense, model validators must independently validate models and ensure the firm's model risk management principles are implemented at all stages of the model lifecycle.

To achieve this purpose, ValidMind provides different tools for developers to document and validate models regardless of the technology platform used to build them. 

Model documentation provides a comprehensive record and description of a quantitative model. This documentation should encompass all relevant information about the model in accordance with:

- Regulatory requirements, as set by regulatory bodies
- Model risk policies, as set by your institution
- Assumptions
- Methodologies
- Data and inputs
- Model performance evaluation
- Limitations
- Intended use

The purpose of model documentation is to provide transparency, facilitate understanding, and enable effective governance and oversight of the model.

## Benefits

ValidMind offers a comprehensive platform designed to meet the regulatory compliance and model risk management (MRM) needs of financial institutions. 

Each regulation emphasizes governance, model validation, and controls to ensure robust model risk management and effective ongoing monitoring.

### Regulatory compliance 

The design of our platform aligns with guidelines such as SR 11-7, CP6/22, and Guideline E-23, ensuring models are developed, implemented, and maintained with minimal risk. 

How our platform helps you with regulatory compliance:

SR 11-7: Guidance on Model Risk Management (U.S.): 
:This U.S. regulation focuses on robust model risk management for banks and financial institutions. It outlines three core components: 
   
   1. Model development, implementation, and use: Ensures that models are developed and implemented correctly.
   2. Model validation: Requires rigorous testing and validation of models.
   3. Governance and controls: Stresses the importance of governance structures and control mechanisms.
   
   The regulation also mandates ongoing monitoring and periodic reviews to ensure models remain valid and effective.

CP6/22 – Model risk management principles for banks (UK)
: This UK regulation adopts a principles-based approach and applies to banks and building societies. It covers four main areas:
   
   1. Model risk governance: Establishes the governance structures needed for effective model risk management.
   2. Model inventory: Requires institutions to maintain an inventory of all models.
   3. Model validation: Mandates independent validation of models.
   4. Internal audit: Requires an internal audit to assess model risk management.
   
   The regulation encourages a proportionate application of these principles based on the size and complexity of the institution.

Guideline-E23: Enterprise-Wide Model Risk Management for Deposit-Taking Institutions (Canada)
: This Canadian regulation applies to a range of deposit-taking institutions and emphasizes an enterprise-wide approach to model risk management. It covers:
   
   1. Model development, validation, approval, review, modification, and decommission: Provides a comprehensive framework for the entire lifecycle of a model.
   2. Differentiation between institutions: Makes a distinction between institutions that have internal models approved for regulatory capital purposes (IMAIs) and other standardized institutions (SIs), with different compliance expectations for each.
   
   Each of these regulations aims to ensure that financial models are developed, implemented, and maintained in a manner that minimizes risk and complies with governance standards.
