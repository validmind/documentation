The ValidMind platform is a suite of tools helping model developers and model validators automatically document, validate, and make sure models perform and deliver on expected commercial and regulatory outcomes. Our solution is a onfigurable, SaaS-based platform to automate model documentation and model validation. 


![The ValidMind Platform](platform-overview.png)


Cloud-based, flexible platform 
: Easy to integrate, configure, and scale according to your requirements. ValidMind is designed to be platform-independent, seamlessly integrating into existing model development workflows without causing disruptions. The platform is also easy to use, with an intuitive interface that allows users to view, edit, and manage their model documentation with ease. 


Automated Documentation & Testing 
: Does not disrupt existing model development practices. ValidMind is a cloud-based and flexible platform that enables organizations to conduct their model documentation and model validation activities more efficiently. The platform is designed to be easy to integrate, configure, and scale according to the organization's requirements. It includes automated documentation and testing capabilities, making it easier for model developers to generate model documentation and identify potential areas of risks in their models. 

Easy-to-use & Intuitive
: Enable feedback capture & workflows for MRM. The platform promotes more efficient collaboration and communication between 1st and 2nd line teams, enabling model developers to easily capture and incorporate feedback from model validation teams to ensure more effective model documentation and validation activities.

## Product Components

The ValidMind platform contains two major product components: the Developer Framework and the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform.

### ValidMind Developer framework
ValidMind’s Developer Framework is collection of standalone libraries (Python, R) that customers set up into their existing development environment. The Developer Framework requires access to the data sources where datasets (training, test, and other applicable datasets) and trained model files are stored to run model documentation and validation tests, and to ValidMind’s SaaS platform to populate the model documentation and validation report.

Our Developer Framework automatically generates documentation for algorithmic models and proactively identifies potential risks for both traditional and machine-learning models, thus enabling effective model validation according to compliance and regulatory requirements, while saving teams hundreds of hours of work writing documents today.

### ValidMind SaaS Platform

The SaaS platform implements a multi-tenant architecture to host its SaaS components (application, APIs, databases, and other internal services). Connection to ValidMind’s SaaS platform is done via AWS PrivateLink/Azure Private Link. This network configuration allows customers to consume the ValidMind API services and access ValidMind’s SaaS application as if they were local services to their network. 

AWS PrivateLink/Azure Private Link provides private connectivity between ValidMind and your on-premises networks without exposing your traffic to the public Internet. Additionally, ValidMind only collects metadata used to generate documentation and present test results for the model developer and validation teams.

## Features 

### Documentation-as-Code

ValidMind enables model developers to automatically generate documentation snippets throughout the model development process using the ValidMind Developer Framework. These documentation snippets can be added to the code and model artifacts as comments or other forms of annotations, and they serve as a way of capturing the design decisions, assumptions, and evaluation metrics of the model at different stages of development.

By using the Developer Framework, model developers are able to ensure that the documentation is created continuously throughout the development process, rather than leaving it until the end or omitting important decisions from the documentation after the fact. This approach makes it easier to keep track of evidence through the model development process, to explain the rationale behind design decisions, and to share the knowledge with the model validation team who need to be able to understand the model.

The framework also provides tools for automatically generating more comprehensive documentation from these snippets or annotations which are then surfaced in our SaaS platform UI for consumption by the model validation team and other users.

### Compliant-by-Design

Pre-configured model-based templates ensure documentation is always complete
Templates ensure consistent model validation & testing approach 
Tests can be configured to adapt to specific validation requirements for each use case .

ValidMind’s approach emphasizes the importance of compliance with regulations and requirements set by customers’ model validation teams in the design and development of model use cases. To achieve this, the ValidMind Framework provides pre-configured model-based templates that are designed to ensure that the documentation is always complete. These templates include predefined sections for capturing information about the model inputs and outputs, architecture, and performance metrics, as well as the validation and testing procedures used to evaluate the model. 

Using these templates helps to ensure a consistent approach to model validation and testing, as all models are documented using the same structure and guidelines. This makes it easier for model validators and other stakeholders to review the models and understand how they were developed and tested.

In addition, the tests can be configured to adapt to specific validation requirements for each use case. This means that the testing procedures can be customized to meet the needs of each customer’s existing business processes. For example, some use cases may require more rigorous testing than others, and the tests can be adjusted accordingly to ensure that the model meets the required standards. 

### Proactively Evaluate Model Risks 

Run dozens of configurable automated tests to evaluate data quality, model outcomes, robustness, explainability, and more

Our ValidMind Framework offers dozens of configurable automated tests that can be run to evaluate various aspects of model performance. These tests cover a range of factors, including data quality, model outcomes, robustness, explainability, and more.

By running these automated tests, developers can identify potential issues or risks with the model, such as biases in the training data or lack of robustness to changes in the input data. This information can then be used to make improvements to the model or adjust the testing procedures to ensure that the model meets the required standards.

The tests can also be configured to suit the specific requirements of the model and the intended use case, allowing developers to tailor the testing procedures to their needs. For example, if the model is intended to be used in a high-risk application, more rigorous testing and additional model validation may be necessary to ensure that the model is robust and reliable.

### For Financial Services & Insurance Specifically

Developed specifically to address the risks of banking & insurance model use cases and model risk regulation

We understand that your industries have unique requirements and challenges when it comes to model development, and the ValidMind framework has been developed specifically to address these needs.

One key aspect is addressing the risks associated with the use of machine learning models in banking and insurance use cases, which require a higher degree of accuracy and reliability.Developed specifically to address the risks of  banking & insurance model use cases and model risk regulation By helping you reduce the risk of errors and non-compliance in production, the ValidMind Platform increases the trust that can be placed in your models and the teams that develop and validate them. 

In addition to addressing the specific risks associated with these industries, the framework has also been designed to help you comply with relevant regulations or guidance governing model risk, such as SR 11-7: Guidance on Model Risk Management. We understand that failure to comply with such guidance can result in costly fines and reputational damage, and that compliance with these regulations is critical for financial services and insurance companies.
