ValidMind is a solution for model risk management (MRM) that enables your organization to conduct model documentation and validation activities with greater ease. 

ValidMind's Model Risk Management (MRM) solution stands out in the industry for several reasons:

A cloud-based, flexible platform 
: ValidMind is a versatile software-as-service (SaaS) platform that enables you to integrate, configure, and scale your model development workflows with ease. It is designed to be platform-independent, so you can use it with existing tools and environments. 


Automated documentation and testing 
: Our platform seamlessly adapts to your existing model development practices, helping you generate documentation and identify potential risks with ease. With our automated documentation and testing capabilities, you can streamline your workflow and ensure that your models are accurate, reliable, and secure.

Easy-to-use and intuitive
: The platform facilitates efficient collaboration and communication between first and second-line teams, allowing model developers to seamlessly capture and incorporate feedback from model validation teams. This ensures more effective model documentation and validation activities, leading to better model performance and increased confidence in model outputs.

Whether you work with machine learning models or other data-driven models, ValidMind provides a unified interface that simplifies your documentation and validation processes. You can easily view, edit, and manage your model documentation and validation reports, making it simple to track your progress and collaborate with your team. 

## Product Components

ValidMind contains two major product components: the Developer Framework and the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform.

### ValidMind Developer framework

ValidMind’s Developer Framework is collection of standalone libraries in Python and R that you set up into their existing development environment. The Developer Framework requires access to the data sources where datasets (training, test, and other applicable datasets) and trained model files are stored to run model documentation and validation tests, and to ValidMind’s SaaS platform to populate the model documentation and validation report.

Our Developer Framework automatically generates documentation for algorithmic models and proactively identifies potential risks for both traditional and machine-learning models, thus enabling effective model validation according to compliance and regulatory requirements, while saving teams hundreds of hours of work writing documents today.

### ValidMind SaaS Platform

The SaaS platform implements a multi-tenant architecture to host its SaaS components (application, APIs, databases, and other internal services). Connection to ValidMind’s SaaS platform is done via AWS PrivateLink/Azure Private Link. This network configuration allows you to consume the ValidMind API services and access ValidMind’s SaaS application as if they were local services to their network. 

AWS PrivateLink/Azure Private Link provides private connectivity between ValidMind and your on-premises networks without exposing your traffic to the public Internet. Additionally, ValidMind only collects metadata used to generate documentation and present test results for the model developer and validation teams.
