To help you understand how ValidMind works, we are providing an introductory notebook which will show you how to create a new documentation project, initialize the ValidMind Developer Framework, and run documentation functions on a sample dataset and model trained for demonstration purposes. The generated documentation can then be viewed on the ValidMind Platform. 

For model developers, we recommend that you check out our sample Jupyter notebook and then try running it for yourself using our notebook on Google Colab.

## Steps 

1. Check out the sample notebook:

   [Intro to ValidMind: Bank Customer Churn Prediction](../notebooks/intro.ipynb)

- [ValidMind Python Library Introduction](../notebooks/intro-r.ipynb) — {{< fa brands r-project >}}

<!-- TO DO we need to add the correct download link here --->

2. Get access to the notebook source: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/)
  
   Google Colaboratory (Colab) is a free Jupyter notebook environment that runs in the cloud. There, you can work with our Jupyter notebooks, write and execute code, share your work to collaborate in real-time, and export our notebooks to try them out locally in your own developer environment.

## What's Next

Next, you can [explore our Validmind Platform](explore-validmind-platform.qmd) to see where information uploaded by the Developer Framework ends up.
