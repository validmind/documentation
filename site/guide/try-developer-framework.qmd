For model developers, we recommend that you check out our sample Jupyter notebook and then try modifying the notebook yourself:

The notebook shows you how to initialize the ValidMind Developer Framework, prepare a demo dataset, run test plans, train a model, and then upload to the ValidMind Platform. 

## Steps 

1. Check out the sample notebook:

   [Intro to ValidMind:  ](../notebooks/intro.ipynb)

<!---
- [ValidMind Python Library Introduction](../notebooks/intro-r.ipynb) — {{< fa brands r-project >}}
--->
<!-- TO DO we need to add the correct download link here --->

2. Get access to the notebook source:

   [Go to Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

After you download the notebook source, you can try out changes locally in your own developer environment and run the notebooks from there.

For more advanced examples, we offer some additional [Jupyter notebooks](jupyter-notebooks.qmd).

## What's Next

Next, you can try [exploring our Validmind Platform](explore-validmind-platform.qmd).
