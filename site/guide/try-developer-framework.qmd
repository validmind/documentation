For model developers, we recommend that you check out our sample Jupyter notebook and then try modifying the notebook yourself:

The notebook shows you how to initialize the ValidMind Developer Framework, prepare a demo dataset, run test plans, train a model, and then upload to the ValidMind Platform. 

## Steps 

1. Check out the sample notebook:

   [Intro to ValidMind: Bank Customer Churn Prediction](../notebooks/intro.ipynb)

<!---
- [ValidMind Python Library Introduction](../notebooks/intro-r.ipynb) — {{< fa brands r-project >}}
--->
<!-- TO DO we need to add the correct download link here --->

2. Get access to the notebook source: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/)
  
   Google Colaboratory (Colab) is a free Jupyter notebook environment that runs in the cloud. There, you can work with our Jupyter notebooks, write and execute code, share your work to collaborate in real-time, and export our notebooks to try them out locally in your own developer environment.

## What's Next

Next, you can [explore our Validmind Platform](explore-validmind-platform.qmd) to see where information uploaded by the Developer Framework ends up.
