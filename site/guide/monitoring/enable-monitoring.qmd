To start uploading ongoing monitoring results for a model to {{< var vm.product >}}, you enable monitoring in your code snippet and then select a monitoring template. You can enable monitoring for both new and existing models. 

Enable monitoring with two steps:

1. [Add `monitoring=True` to your code snippet](#add-monitoringtrue-to-your-code-snippet)
2. [Select a monitoring template](#select-a-monitoring-template)

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] You are a [{{< fa code >}} Developer]{.bubble} or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^1]
- [x] The model is in the pre-approval stage for performance testing or the model has been approved and is in production.

## Add `monitoring=True` to your code snippet 

{{< var vm.product >}} generates a unique _code snippet_ for each registered model to connect with your developer environment. You initialize the {{< var validmind.developer >}} with this code snippet, which ensures that your documentation and tests are uploaded to the correct model when you run the notebook. 

To enable ongoing monitoring for a model, add `monitoring=True` to your code snippet: 

1. In the {{< var validmind.platform >}}, either register a new model[^2] or locate an existing model:

   - In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.
   - Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^3]

2. Copy the code snippet for the model: 

   - In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **{{< fa rocket >}} Getting Started**.
   - Locate the code snippet and set **[enable ongoing monitoring]{.smallcaps}** to true.
   - Click **{{< fa regular copy >}} Copy snippet to clipboard**. 

3. Paste the snippet into your development source code.[^4]

   Confirm that `monitoring=True` is present in the `vm.init` method, similar to this example:
   
   ```python
   import validmind as vm
   
   vm.init(
       api_host="https://api.prod.validmind.ai/api/v1/tracking",
       api_key="...",
       api_secret="...",
       model="...",
       monitoring=True
   )
   ```

::: {.column-margin}
To enable monitoring when you are storing credentials in an `.env` file:^[[Store model credentials in `.env` files](/developer/model-documentation/store-credentials-in-env-file.qmd)]

```python
%load_ext dotenv
%dotenv .env

import validmind as vm

vm.init(
   monitoring=True
)
```

:::

## Select a monitoring template

Before you can start sending ongoing monitoring data from your developer environment to {{< var vm.product >}}, you must select a monitoring template:

1. In the {{< var validmind.platform >}}, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory** in the left sidebar.

2. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^5]

3. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa desktop >}} Ongoing Monitoring**.

4. From the **[template]{.smallcaps}** drop-down, select one of the available monitoring templates. 

5. Click **Use Template** to apply your desired template.

   - After you select a template, the initial document where your ongoing monitoring results will be stored becomes available. 
   - Review this documents structure to confirm that it meets your requirements, then start running your code to populate the template with monitoring results. 


## Troubleshooting

If you see errors similar to this one when running your code, make sure that you have selected your monitoring template and then re-run your code: 

```bash
APIRequestError: Please select an ongoing monitoring template on the {{< var validmind.platform >}} first
```


## What's next

After you have enabled ongoing monitoring and run your code to generate some output, you can start reviewing the monitoring results.[^6]
