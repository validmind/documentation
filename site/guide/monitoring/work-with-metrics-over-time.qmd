Once generated via the {{< var validmind.developer >}}, view and add metrics over time to your ongoing monitoring plans in the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.

Metrics over time refers to the continued monitoring of a model's performance once it is deployed. Tracking how a model performs as new data is introduced or conditions change ensures that it remains accurate and reliable in real-world environments where data distributions or market conditions shift.

- Model performance is determined by continuously measuring metrics and comparing them over time to detect degradation, bias, or shifts in the model's output.
- Performance data is collected and tracked over time, often using a rolling window approach or real-time monitoring tools with the same metrics used in testing, but observed across different periods.
- Continuous tracking helps to identify if and when a model needs to be recalibrated, retrained, or even replaced due to performance deterioration or changing conditions.

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] Metrics over time have already been logged via the {{< var validmind.developer >}} for your model.[^1]
- [x] You are a [{{< fa code >}} Developer]{.bubble} or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^2]

## Add metrics over time

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^3]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **{{< fa book-open >}} Documentation** or **{{< fa desktop >}} Ongoing Monitoring**.

4. Click on a section header to expand that section and add content.

5. Hover your mouse over the space where you want your new block to go until a horizontal dashed line with a {{< fa square-plus >}} sign appears that indicates you can insert a new block:

6. Click {{< fa square-plus >}} and then select **Metric Over Time**.[^4]

    By default, only the [{{< fa code >}} Developer]{.bubble} role can add metrics over time within model documentation or ongoing monitoring plans.

7. Select metric over time results:

   - Choose from available **VM Library** (out-of-the-box) or **Custom** tests under [metric over time]{.smallcaps} in the left sidebar of the test selection modal.
   - Use **{{<fa magnifying-glass >}} Search by name** on the top-left to locate specific metric results.

   To preview what is included in a metric, click on it. By default, the actively selected metric is previewed.

8. Click **Insert # Metrics(s) Over Time to Document** when you are ready.

9. After inserting the metrics into your document, review the data to confirm that it is accurate and relevant.

## View metric over time metadata

After you have added metrics over time to your document, you can view the following information attached to the result:

- Date and time the metric was recorded
- Who updated the metric
- The numeric value of the metric
- The metric's thresholds
- Any additional parameters

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^5]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **{{< fa book-open >}} Documentation** or **{{< fa desktop >}} Ongoing Monitoring**.

4. Locate the metric whose metadata you want to view.

5. Under the metric's name, click on **Data** tab.
