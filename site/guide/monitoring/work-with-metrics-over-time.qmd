Once generated via the {{< var validmind.developer >}}, view and add metrics over time to your ongoing monitoring plans in the {{< var validmind.platform >}}.

Metrics over time refers to the continued monitoring of a model's performance once it is deployed. Tracking how a model performs as new data is introduced or conditions change ensures that it remains accurate and reliable in real-world environments where data distributions or market conditions shift. 

- Model performance is determined by continously measuring metrics and comparing them over time to detect degration, bias, or shifts in the model's output. 
- Performance data is collected and tracked over time, often using a rolling window approach or real-time monitoring tools with the same metrics used in testing, but observed across different periods. 
- Continuous tracking helps to identify if and when a model needs to be recalibrated, retrained, or even replaced due to performance deterioration or changing conditions.

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] Metrics over time have already been logged via the {{< var validmind.developer >}} for your model.[^1] 
- [x] You are a `Developer` or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^2]

## Add metrics over time

1. In the left sidebar, click **Model Inventory**.

2. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^3]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Documentation** or **Ongoing Monitoring**.

   You can now jump to any section of the model documentation or ongoing monitoring plan by expanding the table of contents on the left and selecting the relevant section you would like to add content to, such as **1.1 Model Monitoring Performance History**. 

4. Hover your mouse over the space where you want your new block to go until a horizontal dashed line with a {{< fa square-plus >}} sign appears that indicates you can insert a new block:

5. Click {{< fa square-plus >}} and then select **Metric Over Time**.[^4]

    By default, only the `Developer` role can add metrics over time within model documentation or ongoing monitoring plans.

6. Select metric over time results:

   - Select the metric over time to insert into the model documentation from the list of available metrics.
   - Search by name using **{{<fa magnifying-glass >}} Search** on the top-left to locate specific metrics.

   To preview what is included in a metric, click on it. By default, the actively selected metric is previewed.

7. Click **Insert # Metrics(s) Over Time to Document** when you are ready.

8. After inserting the metrics into your document, review the data to confirm that it is accurate and relevant.


## View metric over time metadata

After you have added metrics over time to your document, you can view the following information attached to the result:

- Date and time the metric was recorded
- Who updated the metric
- The numeric value of the metric
- Any additional parameters

1. In the left sidebar, click **Model Inventory**.

2. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^5]

3. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Documentation** or **Ongoing Monitoring**.

4. Locate the metric whose metadata you want to view. 

5. Under the metric's name, click on **Data** tab.
