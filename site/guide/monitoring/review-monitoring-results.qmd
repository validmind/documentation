To ensure your model continues to perform as expected, it's important to regularly review the monitoring results generated during the ongoing monitoring process. 

- As your code runs, the monitoring template for your model automatically populates with data, providing a comprehensive view of your model's performance over time. 
- You access and examine these results within the {{< var validmind.platform >}}, allowing you to identify any deviations from expected performance and take corrective actions as needed.

## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] You are a `Developer` or `Validator`, or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^1]
- [x] The model is in the pre-approval stage for performance testing or the model has been approved and is in production.

## Steps 

::: {.callout}
For results to be present and available for review, ongoing monitoring must be enabled.[^2]
:::

1. In the {{< var validmind.platform >}}, click **Model Inventory** in the left sidebar.

2. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^3]

3. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa desktop >}} Ongoing Monitoring**. 
   
    - You can now explore the different sections of the template and review the results. 
    - Any deviations from the expected performance should be identified and acted on if necessary.

    For example, click **2.3. Target Drift** under 2. Data Quality & Drift Assessment and scroll down:
