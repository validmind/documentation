Google Colaboratory (Colab) is a free Jupyter notebook environment that runs in the cloud. There, you can work with our Jupyter notebooks by saving your own copy, write and execute code, share your work to collaborate with others in real-time, and download notebooks to try them out locally in your own developer environment.
