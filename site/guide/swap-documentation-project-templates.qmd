Learn how to swap the structure and configuration of existing documentation templates on the ValidMind Platform. This topic is relevant for model developers who need to seamlessly update an existing documentation project by either switching to an entirely different template or by simply upgrading to a more recent version of the template currently in use. This feature ensures that your documentation projects can remain up-to-date and align with the latest preferred template without the need to start from scratch.

## Prerequisites

* You are a registered user on the ValidMind Platform
* You are logged into the ValidMind Platform

## Steps

1. From the ValidMind Platform homepage, go to **Templates** on the left.

2. Click on one of the available templates to swap the YAML configuration file. 

   In the configuration file that opens, you can swap information about the template, such as: 

   - Name and description of the template
   - Version of the templates
   - Sections in the template and how they are structured
   - Guidelines associated with each section 
   - Metrics from the Developer Framework that feed into the template

::: {.column-margin}
::: {.callout-tip}
Templates can only be configured by an administrator.
