These steps show you how to configure AWS PrivateLink to establish a private connection between ValidMind and your company network without exposing traffic to the public internet. Using PrivateLink can improve the security and compliance of your applications and data by keeping traffic private and reducing the attack surface of your network. 

![AWS PrivateLink](aws-privatelink.png)

AWS PrivateLink is a networking service that allows secure and private communication between Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) resources and services hosted in other VPCs or in AWS partner services, such as ValidMind. With AWS PrivateLink, you can connect to services over the Amazon network, without needing to expose your network traffic to the public internet.

PrivateLink works by creating a private _VPC endpoint_ for a supported AWS service within your virtual private cloud. This endpoint acts as a proxy between your VPC and ValidMind, allowing traffic to be routed privately over the AWS network. To make the endpoint easier to use, ValidMind provides a _private DNS name_ that model developers and validators can connect to in a browser.  

The responsibility of setting up a VPC endpoint for AWS PrivateLink falls to your IT department, such as the cloud engineering, infrastructure, or security teams. To learn more, check [Access an AWS service using an interface VPC endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/create-interface-endpoint.html#create-interface-endpoint).

## Prerequisites

You must have access to the AWS Console for your company and the necessary expertise to set up, configure, and maintain AWS services. 

These steps assume that you already have established connectivity between your own company network and AWS VPC and know which company VPC you want to connect to. 

### VPC service information

<!-- VM will provide one endpoint per region: us-east-1, us-west-2; eu-west-1; eu-central-1 
private.dev.vm.validmind.ai
private.prod.vm.validmind.ai

SOC 2 requires tracking access request for VPC endpoint
Recording: 46:00 FR InfoSec log in and set up endpoint > request pending, need to send endpoint ID and Owner (Account ID) to VM
51:00 VM login accept request pending for endpoint ID after verifying endpoint ID and Owner
56:00 FR InfoSec login
58:55 VM login to verify "Owner"
59:30 FR InfoSec login, verify the endpoint is available, enable private DNS names
1:03 FR Murat private DNS name is availabe, can log into SaaS UI

## Steps

1. Create a VPC endpoint for ValidMind:

   a. Log into the [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/). 
   b. In the VPC dashboard, click **Endpoints** in the navigation pane.
   c. Click **Create endpoint**.
   d. Select **PrivateLink Ready partner services**.
   e. Enter the service name from the [VPC service information](#vpc-service-information) and click **Verify service**.
   f. Select the company VPC that you want to create the endpoint in.
   g. Select the subnets where you want to create the endpoint network interfaces.
   h. Configure the security group for the VPC endpoint. Make sure to allow traffic between your network and the endpoint.
   i. Click **Create endpoint**.

   The status for the endpoint should show `Pending`.

3. Contact ValidMind at [support@validmind.ai](mailto:support@validmind.ai?subject=VPC%20Endpoint%20Connection%20Request) to get your new VPC endpoint connection request accepted. Include the following information:

   - The owner or account ID
   - The VPC endpoint ID

4. After ValidMind has accepted your endpoint connection request, verify the endpoint is available:

   a. In the VPC console, go to the **Endpoints** section.
   b. Check that status for the endpoint shows `Available`.

5. Enable the private DNS name:
   a. Back in the **Endpoints** panel, 
   b. [TO DO Add steps]
   c. [TO DO Add steps]

6. Test the connection:

   a. From your company network, access ValidMind's service using the private DNS name from the [VPC service information](#vpc-service-information).
   b. In a browser, confirm that you can successfully connect to ValidMind's service and log in.
   c. From your developer environment, confirm that you can connect to ValidMind with the developer framework.

After completing these steps, someone on your company network should be able to connect to ValidMind via AWS PrivateLink. This will provide a secure, private connection between your network and ValidMind's service, without exposing your traffic to the public internet.
