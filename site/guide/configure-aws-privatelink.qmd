These steps show you how to configure AWS PrivateLink to establish a private connectivity between ValidMind and your on-premises network without exposing your traffic to the public internet.

AAWS PrivateLink is a networking service that allows secure and private communication between Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) resources and services hosted in other VPCs or in AWS partner services. With AWS PrivateLink, you can connect to services over the Amazon network, without needing to expose traffic to the public internet.

PrivateLink works by creating a private endpoint for a supported AWS service within your virtual private cloud (VPC). This endpoint acts as a proxy between your VPC and the service, allowing traffic to be routed privately over the AWS network rather than going out over the internet.

Using PrivateLink can improve the security and compliance of your applications and data by keeping traffic private and reducing the attack surface of your network. It can also simplify network architecture and reduce network costs by eliminating the need for a public IP address or a NAT gateway.

## Steps

1. Set up a VPC:
   a. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
   b. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.
   c. Create a new Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) or use an existing one.
   d. Create at least one subnet within the VPC.

2. Establish connectivity between your on-premises network and AWS VPC:
   a. Set up a VPN connection or Direct Connect between your on-premises network and the AWS VPC.
   b. Update the necessary routing tables to ensure traffic can flow between your on-premises network and the VPC.

3. Create a VPC endpoint for ValidMind:
   a. In the VPC console, choose **Endpoints** from the left navigation pane.
   b. Click **Create Endpoint**.
   c. Choose **Find service by name** and enter the service name provided by ValidMind.
   d. Choose the VPC you want to create the endpoint in.
   e. Select the subnets where you want to create the endpoint network interfaces.
   f. Configure the security group for the VPC endpoint. Make sure it allows traffic between your network and the endpoint.
   g. Click **Create endpoint**.

4. Verify the endpoint:
   a. In the VPC console, go to the **Endpoints** section.
   b. Check the status of the endpoint you just created. Ensure it's in the **Available** state.

5. Update routing tables:
   a. Update the routing tables in your VPC and on-premises network to ensure traffic flows through the VPC endpoint.

6. Test the connection:
   a. From your on-premises network, attempt to access ValidMind's service using the provided DNS hostname or IP addresses associated with the VPC endpoint.
   b. Confirm that you can successfully connect to ValidMind's service.

7. Configure SaaS provider settings (optional):
   Some SaaS providers may require additional configuration to enable access via AWS PrivateLink. Consult ValidMind's documentation for any specific settings or requirements.

After completing these steps, your on-premises network should be connected to ValidMind via AWS PrivateLink. This will provide a secure, private connection between your network and ValidMind's service, without exposing your traffic to the public internet.
