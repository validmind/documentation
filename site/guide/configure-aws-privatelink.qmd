AAWS PrivateLink is a networking service that allows secure and private communication between Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) resources and services hosted in other VPCs or in AWS partner services. With AWS PrivateLink, you can connect to services over the Amazon network, without needing to expose traffic to the public internet.

PrivateLink works by creating a private endpoint for a supported AWS service within your virtual private cloud (VPC). This endpoint acts as a proxy between your VPC and the service, allowing traffic to be routed privately over the AWS network rather than going out over the internet.

Using PrivateLink can improve the security and compliance of your applications and data by keeping traffic private and reducing the attack surface of your network. It can also simplify network architecture and reduce network costs by eliminating the need for a public IP address or a NAT gateway.
