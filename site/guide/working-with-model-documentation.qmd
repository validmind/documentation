After you upload initial model documentation through the developer framework, you can use the Platform UI to make qualitative edits to model documentation, view guidelines, collaborate with validators, and submit your model documentation for approval. 

## Prerequisites

::: {.callout-important}
## Looking to get started with uploading model documentation?

This section describes how to work with model documentation in the ValidMind Platform UI. Typically, you perform the tasks described here after you have uploaded some initial model documentation. 

To learn how upload model documentation to ValidMind as a developer, go to [Get started with the ValidMind Developer Framework](get-started-developer-framework.qmd)
:::

- You hold the `Developer` role 
- The model is already [registered in the model inventory](register-models-in-model-inventory.qmd)
- You have provided some content for the documentation, either [by uploading it through the ValidMind Developer Framework](get-started-developer-framework.qmd) or via the online UI editor

## Getting started

1. [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_ui >}}).

2. In the left sidebar, click [**Model Inventory**](https://app.prod.validmind.ai/model-inventory).

3. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.

4. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Documentation**.

   You can now jump to any section of the model documentation by expanding the table of contents on the left and selecting the relevant section you would like to view.

5. In any section of the documentation, hover over text content and click the {{< fa edit >}} edit icon that appears on the right of the textbox. 
<!--- **Need image** --->

    You can now use the text editor functions to edit the content of the section.

6. Save your edits when done by clicking on the {{< fa save >}} save icon to the right of the textbox to save your changes.
