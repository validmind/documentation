## Prerequisites

* You hold the `Developer` role 
* The model is already [registered in the model inventory](register-models-in-model-inventory.qmd)
* You have provided some content for the documentation, either [by uploading it through the ValidMind Developer Framework](get-started-developer-framework.qmd) or via the online UI editor
* You have already located the project identifier, API key and secret
* You have already initialized the developer framework for your model

## Steps

1. [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_ui >}}).

2. In the left sidebar, click [**Model Inventory**](https://app.prod.validmind.ai/model-inventory).

3. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.

4. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Documentation**.

   You can now jump to any section of the model documentation by expanding the table of contents on the left and selecting the relevant section you would like to view.

5. In any section of the documentation, hover over text content and click the {{< fa edit >}} edit icon that appears on the right of the textbox.
