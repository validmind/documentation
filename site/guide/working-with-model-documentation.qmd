* You have already located the project identifier, API key and secret
* You have already initialized the Developer Framework for your model

## Steps

2. Navigate to the relevant model documentation project:

   a. In the **Documentation Projects** page, select the project corresponding to the model for which you want to view documentation.
   b. On the **Project Overview** page, select Documentation on the left-hand side.
   c. You can now jump to any section of the model documentation by expanding the table of contents on the left and selecting the relevant section you would like to view.
