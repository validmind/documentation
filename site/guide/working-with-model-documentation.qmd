After you upload initial model documentation through the developer framework, use the Platform UI to make qualitative edits to model documentation, view guidelines, collaborate with validators, and submit your model documentation for approval.

## Looking to get started as a model developer?

This section describes how to work with model documentation in the ValidMind Platform UI. Typically, you perform the tasks described here _after you have uploaded some initial model documentation_ with the ValidMind Developer Framework. 

[Get started with the ValidMind Developer Framework](get-started-developer-framework.qmd)
:::

## Prerequisites

- You hold the `Developer` role 
- The model is already [registered in the model inventory](register-models-in-model-inventory.qmd)
- You have provided some content for the documentation, either [by uploading it through the ValidMind Developer Framework](get-started-developer-framework.qmd) or via the online UI editor

## Key concepts

Each section of your model documentation should address critical aspects of the model's lifecycle, from conceptualization and data preparation through development and ongoing management. This comprehensive documentation approach is essential for ensuring the model's reliability, relevance, and compliance with business and regulatory standards.

Conceptual Soundness
: Establishes the foundation of the model, covering the model overview, intended use and business use case, regulatory requirements, model limitations, and the rationale behind the model selection. It emphasizes the model's purpose, scope, and constraints, which are crucial for stakeholders to understand the model's applicability and limitations.

Data Preparation
: Details the data description, including dataset summary, data quality tests, descriptive statistics, correlations and interactions, and feature selection and engineering. It provides transparency into the data used for model training, ensuring that the model is built on a solid and relevant dataset.

:::

::: {.g-col-6}
Model development
: Discusses the model training, evaluation, explainability, interpretability, diagnosis, including model weak spots, overfit regions, and robustness. This section is vital for understanding how the model was developed, how it performs, and its areas of strength and weakness.

Monitoring and governance
: Focuses on the model's ongoing monitoring plan, implementation, and governance plan. It outlines strategies for maintaining the model's performance over time and ensuring that it remains compliant with regulatory requirements and ethical standards.

## Get started

1. [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_ui >}}).

2. In the left sidebar, click [**Model Inventory**](https://app.prod.validmind.ai/model-inventory).

3. Select a model by clicking on it or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.

4. In the left sidebar that appears for your model, click **Documentation**.

   You can now jump to any section of the model documentation by expanding the table of contents on the left and selecting the relevant section you would like to view.

5. In any section of the documentation, hover over text content and click the {{< fa edit >}} edit icon that appears on the right of the textbox. 

    You can now use the text editor functions to edit the content of the section. Whenever you make a change, an activity log entry is recorded under **Section activity** on the page, just below the section you are editing. 

6. Save your edits as a revision:

   a. Click on the {{< fa clock-rotate-left >}} icon in the editor toolbar.
   b. Select **Save current revision** and enter a name.
   c. Click {{< fa check >}} to save the current revision.
