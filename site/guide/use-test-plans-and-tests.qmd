## Brief Introduction

This article provides an overview of the following topics: 

- What Test and Test Plans are in the Developer Framework

- When to use Test Plans and Tests, and typical scenarios

## What Test and Test Plans are

* Tests are functions contained in the ValidMind Developer Framework, which is designed to run a specific quantitative test on the dataset or model. Test results are sent to the ValidMind Platform to generate the model documentation according to the relevant templates. 

* Test plans are a collection of many tests which are meant to be run simultaneously to validate and document specific aspects of the documentation. For instance, the tabular_dataset" test plan runs several descriptive and data quality tests on a structured dataset, and documents the results in the ValidMind UI. 


## When to use ValidMind Test Plans and Tests

ValidMind provides many built-in Tests and Test Plans which make it easy for a model developer to document their work, at any point during the model development lifecycle when they need to validate that their work satisfies Model Risk Management requirements. 

While the model developer has the flexibility to decide when to use ValidMind Tests and Test plans, we have identified a few typical scenarios which have their own characteristics and needs:
* When you want to document information about your dataset:
  * For generic tabular datasets: **tabular_dataset** test plan
  * For time-series datasets: **time_series_dataset** test plan
* When you want to document information about your model:
  * For binary classification models: **binary_classifier** test plan
  * For time series models: **timeseries** test plan
