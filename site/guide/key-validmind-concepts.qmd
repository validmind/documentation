Documentation project
: All documentation work in ValidMind is organized into projects which act as a container for the model documentation and validation report of your model. Each stage of the modelâ€™s lifecycle constitutes a new project and can be configured with its own templates and workflows. 

Template
: Functions as a test suite and lays out the structure of model documentation, segmented into various sections and sub-sections. ValidMind templates come with pre-defined sections, similar to test placeholders, including boilerplates and spaces designated for documentation and test results: 

- Model documentation is populated when a user successfully executes all the tests contained in a template, thereby completing the test suite. 
Template placeholders get populated with content generated by the ValidMind Developer Framework. 
- Essentially, our platform scans these templates, identifies all tests and systematically organizes them into a well-structured test suite.

The criteria for these templates are typically provided by your model risk management team. They can be programmatically customized to suit the unique requirements of each model use case, a task usually performed by an administrator.

Tests
: A function contained in the ValidMind Developer Framework, which is designed to run a specific quantitative test on the dataset or model. Test results are sent to the ValidMind Platform to generate the model documentation according to the relevant templates.
