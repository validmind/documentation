Model documentation
: The purpose of model documentation is to provide transparency, facilitate understanding, and enable effective governance and oversight of the model. Provides a comprehensive record and description of a quantitative model. Should encompass all relevant information about the model in accordance with:

- Intended use
- Regulatory requirements set by regulatory bodies
- Model risk policies set by your institution
- Assumptions
- Methodologies
- Data and inputs
- Model performance evaluation
- Limitations

Documentation Template
: Functions as a test suite and lays out the structure of model documentation, segmented into various sections and sub-sections. ValidMind templates come with pre-defined sections, similar to test placeholders, including boilerplates and spaces designated for documentation and test results.

Model documentation is populated when the tests contained in a template run successfully, completing the test suite. This process ensures that the model meets all the specified requirements. At the same time, template placeholders get populated with content that documents the model. This content is generated by the ValidMind Developer Framework, providing a coherent structure for model information.

Essentially, our platform scans these templates, identifies all tests, and systematically organizes them into a well-structured test suite. This automation enhances the efficiency and consistency of the validation process.

The criteria for these templates are typically provided by your model risk management team. We provide some templates out of the box that you can use and programmatically customize to suit the requirements of each model use case. This task of customization is usually performed by an administrator, who ensures that the templates align with the organizational standards and specific needs of each model.

Tests
: A function contained in the ValidMind Developer Framework, which is designed to run a specific quantitative test on the dataset or model. Test results are sent to the ValidMind Platform to generate the model documentation according to the relevant templates. 

Test suites
: A collection of tests which are meant to run together to automate generate model documentation end-to-end for specific use-cases.

Example: the [`classifier_full_suite`](../validmind/validmind/test_suites/classifier.html#ClassifierFullSuite) test suite runs the tests from the [`tabular_dataset`](../validmind/validmind/test_suites/tabular_datasets.html) and [`classifier`](../validmind/validmind/test_suites/classifier.html) test suites to fully document the data and model sections for binary classification model use-cases.
