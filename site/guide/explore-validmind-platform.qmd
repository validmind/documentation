Learn how to get started with the ValidMind Platform. The ValidMind Platform is the central place to: 

  - View results and documentation uploaded via the Developer Framework
  - Collaborate with other model developers, model reviewers and validators, and other users involved in the documentation and validation workflow

## Explore how documentation and test results get uploaded 

Get a walk-through for how uploads to the ValidMind Platform appear. These steps use an existing project that goes with our intro notebook, but they demonstrate how the Developer Framework and the ValidMind Platform work hand-in-hand. 

1. [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_ui >}}).

2. From the side navigation, select **Model Inventory**.

3. Locate or search for the `Customer Churn Model` and select it.

   On the model details page that open, you can find important information about the model, such as:

    - The ID of the model and its specific use case
    - The owners, developers, validators, and business unit associated with the model
    - The approval route for the validation workflow 
    - The risk tier, current version, and the last and next validation dates
    - And more

4. Scroll down to **Project History** and select the model.

   On the project details page that opens, you can see what is included, such as documentation, project findings, validation report, and more.

   If you want to know more about what these sections provide, check out our [Introduction to the ValidMind Developer Framework](developer-framework-introduction.qmd#validmind-documentation-project-structure).

   Note also that the model status is **In Documentation**. This is the status that a model starts in as part of a documentation project. You can click **See workflow** to look at what the full workflow is, from documentation, to validation, to review, and finally approval. 
    
5. Select **Documentation**, **2. Data preparation** and then **2.1. Data description**. 

   ![The Data description page](data-description.png){width=95% fig-align="left" fig-alt="An image showing the data description page in the ValidMind UI"}

   This content is generated by the ValidMind developer framework and provides information about the dataset used, including histograms, information about dataset quality,

## Create a new documentation project

Learn how to create a new documentation project in the ValidMind Platform which you can use to upload tests and documentation, review and validate models, and generate validation reports.

1. [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_ui >}}).
   
2. On the **Documentation Projects** page, click **Create new project**.
   
3. Select the relevant details in the form:

   - Select the relevant model 
   - Select the relevant type of documentation you are looking to generate 
   - Enter a name for the project 

4. Click **Create Project**.

::: {.callout-tip}
The documentation template is automatically applied based on the selected model details and documentation requirements configured by an administrator, such as your model risk management team.
:::
:::

ValidMind has now created an empty documentation project associated with the model. You can access this project from the UI on the **Documentation Projects** page or by navigating to the relevant model details page in the **Model Inventory** page.

4. Locating the project identifier, API key and secret:
   
   On the **Client Integration** page of the newly created project, you can find the initialization code that enables the client library to associate documentation and tests with the appropriate project. The initialization code configures the following arguments: 

- `api_host`: The location of the ValidMind API
- `api_key`: The account API key
- `api_secret`: The account secret key
- `project`: The project identifier

The code snippet can be copied and pasted directly into your developer source code to integrate the ValidMind Developer Framework and to be able to upload to the ValidMind Platform.
