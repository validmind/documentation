## Explore how documentation and test results get uploaded 

Get a walk-through for how uploads to the ValidMind Platform appear. These steps use an existing project, but they demonstrate how the Developer Framework and the ValidMind Platform work hand-in-hand. 

1. [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_ui >}}).

2. From the side navigation, select **Model Inventory**.

3. Locate or search for the `Customer Churn Model` and select it.

   On the model details page that open, you can find important information about the model, such as:

    - The ID of the model and its specific use case
    - The owners, developers, validators, and business unit associated with the model
    - The approval route for the validation workflow 
    - The risk tier, current version, and the last and next validation dates
    - And more

4. Scroll down to **Project History** and select the model.

   Note that the model status is **In Documentation**. This is the status that a model starts in when you register it for initial validation. 
    
5. Click **Customer Churn Model - Initial Validation**.

    The project opens and you

## Create a new documentation project

Learn how to create a new documentation project in the ValidMind Platform which you can use to upload tests and documentation, review and validate models, and generate validation reports.

1. [Log in to the ValidMind UI]({{< var vm_ui >}}).
   
2. On the **Documentation Projects** page, click **Create new project**.
   
3. Select the relevant details in the form:

   - Select the relevant model 
   - Select the relevant type of documentation you are looking to generate 
   - Enter a name for the project 

4. Click **Create Project**.

::: {.column-margin}
::: {.callout-tip}
The documentation template is automatically applied based on the selected model details and documentation requirements configured by an administrator, such as your model risk management team.
:::
:::

ValidMind has now created an empty documentation project associated with the model. You can access this project from the UI on the **Documentation Projects** page or by navigating to the relevant model details page in the **Model Inventory** page.

4. Locating the project identifier, API key and secret:
   
   On the **Client Integration** page of the newly created project, you can find the initialization code that enables the client library to associate documentation and tests with the appropriate project. The initialization code configures the following arguments: 

- `api_host`: The location of the ValidMind API
- `api_key`: The account API key
- `api_secret`: The account secret key
- `project`: The project identifier

The code snippet can be copied and pasted directly into your developer source code to integrate the ValidMind Developer Framework and to be able to upload to the ValidMind Platform.
