Learn how ValidMind enhances collaboration between model validators and developers on documentation projects. This topic is relevant for model validators who want to track changes across projects, add comments, and access revision history for real-time collaboration with model developers.


## Prerequisites

* The model you are documenting is registered in the model inventory
* A documentation project has submitted for review or validation by the model validation team 
* You are logged into the ValidMind Platform

## Tracking changes

### Suggesting a change

1. Click the **Track changes** button in the toolbar to turn on suggestion mode.

2. Make your changes to the documentation project. When changes tracking is enabled, other project contributers can accept or decline the suggested changes.

### Resolving changes

1. Suggested changes appear in green or red highlighted text, depending on if the change is adding or removing content. To accept or decline a change, click the highlighted text, then click <span style="color: green">{{< fa check >}}</span> or <span style="color: red">{{< fa xmark >}}</span>. You can also reply to a suggested change.

2. To mass accept or decline suggestions, click the dropdown arror next to the **Track changes** button and click the desired option.

## Revision history

### Saving a version

1. Click the **Revision history** button in the toolbar.

2. In the dropdown, click **Save current version**. Optionally, enter a version name. The default name is the date and time the latest change was made.

### Viewing revision history

1. Click the **Revision history button** in the toolbar, then click **Open revision history**. Here, you can view a history of all saved versions and your current version.

2. To see the the change made with each version, select the version in the right sidebar. Changes made in that version are highlighted. Hover over the highlighted content to see who made the change.

### Restoring a version

1. To restore a version, select the desired version and click **Restore this version**.

2. The restored version will now appear under revision history with the name: "Restored: 'version name'". To exit revision history without restoring a version, click **Back to editing**.

## Real-time collaboration

Users can simultaneously edit the documentation project, leave and respond to comments suggestions, and access revision history. Changes to the documentation project are also automatically added to ValidMind's activity feed.

## Additional features

- **Spell and grammar checker**.

- **Math formulas**. Add math formulas to documentation by clicking the **MathType** button and using the toolbar, or switch to handwriting.
