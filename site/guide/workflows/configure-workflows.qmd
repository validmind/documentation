## Prerequisites

- [x] {{< var link.login >}}
- [x] Model stages must be fully configured.[^1]
- [x] You are a [{{< fa hand >}} Customer Admin]{.bubble} or assigned another role with sufficient permissions to perform the tasks in this guide.[^2]

:::

## Create custom workflows

To set up a new custom workflow, you'll need to complete these three steps in sequence:

1. [Add a new workflow](#add-new-workflows)
2. [Configure the workflow steps](#configure-workflow-steps)
3. [Link the workflow together](#link-workflow-together)

### Add new workflows

{{< include /guide/workflows/_add-new-workflows.qmd >}}

### Configure workflow steps

{{< include /guide/workflows/_configure-workflow-steps.qmd >}}

### Link workflow together

{{< include /guide/workflows/_link-workflow-together.qmd >}}

::: {.callout title="Workflow steps relationship unclear on your canvas?"}
Click **Tidy Layout** at any time for a linear view of your workflow.

## Clone existing workflows

To create a copy of an existing workflow:

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Workspace, select **Workflows**.

3. Select the tab for the type of workflow to clone:

    - **Model Workflows** — Workflows that apply to models in your inventory.[^3]
    - **Artifact Workflows** — Workflows that apply to logged artifacts.[^4]

4. Hover over the workflow you'd like to clone.

5.  When the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** appears, click on it and select **{{< fa copy >}} Clone Workflow**.

6. Make your changes to the workflow's **[title]{.smallcaps}** and **[workflow type]{.smallcaps}**.

    Additional changes can be made to the cloned workflow after cloning by editing.[^5]


## Edit existing workflows

You can edit a workflow in several ways:

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Via **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Workspace, select **Workflows**.

3. Select the type of workflow, then click on the workflow you'd like to modify to edit the configuration for that workflow.

#### Via workflows applied to models

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**.

2. Select a model or find your model by applying a filter or searching for it.[^6]

3. On the landing page of your model, locate the [active workflows]{.smallcaps} section.

4. Click on the name of the workflow you'd like to abort to open that specific workflow's details.

5. On the workflow's detail modal, click on the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** in the top-right hand corner and select **{{< fa pencil >}} Edit Workflow**.

#### Via workflows applied to artifacts

1. On the details page of your artifact,[^7] locate the [active workflows]{.smallcaps} section.

2. Click on the name of the workflow you'd like to abort to open that specific workflow's details.

3. On the workflow's detail modal, click on the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** in the top-right hand corner and select **{{< fa pencil >}} Edit Workflow**.

:::

a. Make your desired changes to step configuration[^8] and step relationships[^9] on your workflow.

b. When you are finished, click **Save Workflow** to apply your changes.

### Delete workflow steps

::: {.callout-important title="Workflow step deletion is permanent."}
Deleting workflow steps on workflows active on models may result in malfunctioning workflows.
:::

1. Hover over the step you want to delete.

2. When the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** menu appears, click on it and select **{{< fa gear >}} Delete**.

    On the confirmation dialogue that appears, select **OK** to confirm deletion.

3. When you are finished, click **Save Workflow** to apply your changes.

### Remove links between steps

1. Hover over a connection until the **{{< fa trash-can >}}** appears.

2. Click **{{< fa trash-can >}}** to delete the connection.

    On the confirmation dialogue that appears, select **OK** to confirm deletion.

3. When you are finished, click **Save Workflow** to apply your changes.

## Delete existing workflows

::: {.callout-important title="Workflow deletion is permanent."}
- If a workflow is in use on a model, that model will not be impacted.
- Deletion will prevent any future runs of that workflow.
:::

1. In the left sidebar, click **{{< fa gear >}} Settings**.

2. Under Workspace, select **Workflows**.

3. Hover over the workflow you would like to remove.

3. When the **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** appears, click on it and select **{{< fa ban >}} Delete Workflow**.
