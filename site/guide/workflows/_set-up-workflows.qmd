Configure workflows to match your organizational needs for overseeing model development, validation, implementation, ongoing monitoring, auditing, or other risk management activities.

- Models in your model inventory transition through your organization's custom model lifecycles via model stages, which are in turn manipulated via workflows.
- Workflows are comprised of workflow steps, and have their own workflow states discrete from model stages.
- Some step types allow you to define conditional requirements, providing flexible customization.
