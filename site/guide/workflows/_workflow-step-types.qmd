:::

To configure a condition branch:

1. On the Configure Condition Branch modal, click **{{< fa plus >}} Add Branch**.

    To remove a path, click **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** and select **{{< fa trash-can >}} Remove Path**.
4. When you are finished setting up all your branch paths, click **Update Step** to save your step.
