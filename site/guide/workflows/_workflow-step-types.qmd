### Conditional

#### {{< fa maximize >}} Condition Branch

- Allows diverging paths based on conditional requirements.
- A `default` branch will be automatically included as a catch-all `else` path to ensure that your conditional logic is complete.

::: {.callout-important}
Workflows cannot be saved until condition branches are connected to other steps.
:::

To configure a condition branch:

1. On the Configure Condition Branch modal, click **{{< fa plus >}} Add Branch**.
2. Enter in the **[path name]{.smallcaps}** and designate the **[conditions]{.smallcaps}**^[[Conditional requirements](/guide/workflows/setting-up-workflows.qmd#conditional-requirements)] that apply to this path.
3. Continue with steps 1 and 2 until your conditional branch logic is complete.

    To remove a path, click **{{< fa ellipsis-vertical >}}** and select **{{< fa trash-can >}} Remove Path**.
4. When you are finished setting up all your branch paths, click **Update Step** to save your step.

    Proceed with linking the Condition Branch with your subsequent steps.^[[Link workflow together](/guide/workflows/configure-workflows.qmd#link-workflow-together)]

#### {{< fa clock >}} Wait

- Creates a time condition for displaying next available action.^[[Conditional requirements](/guide/workflows/setting-up-workflows.qmd#conditional-requirements)]
- Used to enforce a time delay or a calendar date milestone.

::: {.callout title="Time stamp configuration is in the current user's timezone."}
Other users viewing those fields or the workflow will see the value automatically in their timezone.

:::

To configure a wait step, select when you would like to [resume workflow:]{.smallcaps}

| Option | Required field(s) | Description |
|---:|---|---|
| After Time Interval  | [wait duration]{.smallcaps} | Wait for a set amount of time. Applies to all models under the workflow. |
| At Specified Date | [wait until]{.smallcaps} | Wait until a specific timestamp. Applies to all models under the workflow. If the milestone date inputted is in the past, the next workflow step will display immediately. |
| At Specified Date on Model Field | [model field]{.smallcaps}^[[Manage model inventory fields](/guide/model-inventory/manage-model-inventory-fields.qmd#inventory-field-types)] | Wait until a specific timestamp as defined by a model inventory field on a per model basis. If the selected field is empty^[Make model inventory fields **[required when creating models]{.smallcaps}** to ensure necessary fields have valid values.] or the milestone date inputted is in the past, the next workflow step will display immediately. |
| Time Delta from Specified Date on Model Field | [model field]{.smallcaps},^[[Manage model inventory fields](/guide/model-inventory/manage-model-inventory-fields.qmd#inventory-field-types)] [time delta direction]{.smallcaps}, [wait duration]{.smallcaps} | Wait for a calculated time relative to a date in a model field on a per model basis. If the selected field is empty^[Make model inventory fields **[required when creating models]{.smallcaps}** to ensure necessary fields have valid values.] or the milestone date inputted is in the past, the next workflow step will display immediately. |
: **{{< fa clock >}} Wait** step configuration {.hover tbl-colwidths="[30,15,45]"}

### Workflow Logic

#### {{< fa arrow-right-arrow-left >}} Run Workflow

Triggers another workflow indicated by **[select workflow to run]{.smallcaps}**, allowing you to chain workflows.

#### {{< fa circle-stop >}} End

- Designates the end of your workflow.
- Use this step when all of your other steps have been configured and linked together.^[[Link workflow together](/guide/workflows/configure-workflows.qmd#link-workflow-together)]

[^step-types-1]:

    - Select the field, then click **{{< fa plus >}} Add Field** to insert.
    - [Manage model inventory fields](/guide/model-inventory/manage-model-inventory-fields.qmd)

    Users must have write permissions for the field in order to enter values.


[^step-types-2]: **[Configure workflows](/guide/workflows/configure-workflows.qmd#create-custom-workflows):**<br><br>

    1. Configure two **{{< fa cube >}} Model Stage Change** steps for your associated rejection and approval stages.
    2. Then, from the bottom of your **{{< fa users >}} Approval** step:
        a. Connect the left [**{{< fa circle >}}**]{.red} (red) to your rejection step.
        b. Connect the right [**{{< fa circle >}}**]{.green} (green) to your approval step.

[^step-types-3]: Use the rich text editor to compose your message:

    1. Include optional details about the model the workflow is running on using the **{ } Insert Variable** drop-down.
    2. Click on the **Preview** tab and choose a model under **[select model for preview]{.smallcaps}** to confirm how the notification will appear when rendered.
