Learn from example workflow configurations to help you tailor workflows to fit your organization's requirements for managing model risk throughout your entire model lifecycles.

## Example workflows

Workflows can be as simple or as complex as required, with multiple and discrete workflows supported for unique triggers and scenarios.

For example, to cover activities in their model lifecycle up to model deployment, an organization has the following model workflows configured:

::: {.panel-tabset}

### On model registration

This workflow initiates upon model registration[^1] — when models are added to the **{{< fa cubes >}} Inventory**, and covers model development activities, including documentation of the model.

- This particular organization pairs their developers into teams of two, where one develops and initially documents the model, and the other peer reviews and approves the model for official validation, requesting revisions if the documentation is incomplete.
- They meticulously transition the model through the stages[^2] of their development cycle with this workflow, as well as transition the workflow into linked states.[^3]

:::

### On model validation

This workflow is initiated manually[^4] — in this case via {{< fa arrow-right-arrow-left >}} Run Workflow step in the previous *On model registration* workflow.

- In this workflow, the model stage[^5] remains as [In Initial Validation]{.bubble} throughout, while the state of the workflow[^6] transitions to reflect the status of validation.
- The option to develop potential challenger models is at the discretion of the validator, or they can choose to approve the champion model without submitting additional challengers.
- Depending on whether or not the model is a GenAI model,[^7] the validation report is also submitted for additional review to the organization's legal team before approval.

:::

### On model deployment

This workflow is initiated when a field is populated — in this case, when the model is slated for deployment by entering value into the [deployment scheduled]{.smallcaps} date time field.[^8]

- The workflow will wait until the timestamp indicated in the scheduled deployment date before revealing the next available action in the workflow — in this case, the option to deploy the model and enter in a concrete date the model was initially pushed to production.
- After a model is deployed via this workflow, an email notification is sent to users notifying them of the completed implementation.
- Actions on this workflow are linked both to a transition in model stage,[^9] as well as workflow state.[^10]

## Workflow step type examples

#### {{< fa cube >}} Model Stage Change

In this example, the model transitions into a stage[^11] called [In Documentation]{.bubble}:

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-60-ns}

![Example {{< fa cube >}} Model Stage Change
 configuration modal](configure_model-stage-change.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing an example Model Stage Change configuration modal" .screenshot group="stage-change"}
:::

::: {.w-40-ns}

![Example {{< fa cube >}} Model Stage Change
 step](example_model-stage-change.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing an example Model Stage Change step" .screenshot group="stage-change"}

:::

::::

#### {{< fa wifi >}} Workflow State Change

In this example, the workflow transitions into a state[^12] called [Model In Development]{.bubble} and progresses the workflow completion to 25%:

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-60-ns}

![Example {{< fa wifi >}} Workflow State Change configuration modal](configure_workflow-state-change.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing an example Workflow State Change configuration modal" .screenshot group="state-change"}
:::

::: {.w-40-ns}

![Example {{< fa wifi >}} Workflow State Change step](example_workflow-state-change.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing an example Workflow State Change step" .screenshot group="state-change"}

:::

::::

#### {{< fa arrow-pointer >}} User Action v2

In this example, the user is presented with an action button labelled **{{< fa arrow-right >}} Submit Documentation For Review** that requires them to include a model export in a [model export]{.smallcaps} attachment type field.[^13]

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-60-ns}

![Example {{< fa arrow-pointer >}} User Action v2 configuration modal](configure_user-action.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing an example User Action v2 configuration modal" .screenshot group="user-action"}
:::

::: {.w-40-ns}

![Example {{< fa arrow-pointer >}} User Action v2 step](example_user-action.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing an example User Action v2 step" .screenshot group="user-action"}

:::

::::

![Example {{< fa arrow-pointer >}} User Action v2 submission panel](example_user-action-submit.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing an example User Action v2 submission panel" width=90% .screenshot group="user-action"}

#### {{< fa users >}} Approval

In this example, the [peer reviewers]{.smallcaps} model stakeholders[^14] assigned to the model are presented with an approval message and a `Data Sources` field to review:

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-50-ns}

![Example {{< fa users >}} Approval configuration modal](configure_approval.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing an example Approval configuration modal" .screenshot group="approval"}
:::

::: {.w-40-ns}

![Example {{< fa users >}} Approval step](example_approval.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing an example Approval step" .screenshot group="approval"}

:::

::::

![Example {{< fa users >}} Approval message](example_approval-message.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing an example Approval message" width=90% .screenshot group="approval"}

#### {{< fa bullhorn >}} Broadcast

In this example, the [Customer Admin]{.bubble} user role[^15] is sent an email notification after a model is deployed:

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-50-ns}

![Example {{< fa bullhorn >}} Broadcast configuration modal](configure_broadcast.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing an example Broadcast configuration modal" .screenshot group="broadcast"}
:::

::: {.w-40-ns}

![Example {{< fa bullhorn >}} Broadcast step](example_broadcast.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing an example Broadcast step" .screenshot group="broadcast"}

![Example {{< fa bullhorn >}} Broadcast notification preview](example_broadcast-notif.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing an example Broadcast notification preview" .screenshot group="broadcast"}

:::

::::

#### {{< fa maximize >}} Condition Branch

In this example, models where the field [genai model]{.smallcaps} is set to true undergo a special [legal review]{.smallcaps} model stakeholder[^16] approval process:[^17]

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-40-ns}

![Example {{< fa maximize >}} Condition Branch configuration modal](configure_condition-branch.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing an example Condition Branch configuration modal" .screenshot group="condition-branch"}
:::

::: {.w-50-ns}

![Example {{< fa maximize >}} Condition Branch step](example_condition-branch.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing an example Condition Branch step" .screenshot group="condition-branch"}

:::

::::

#### {{< fa clock >}} Wait

In this example, the next step on the workflow waits until the timestamp indicated in a [deployment scheduled]{.smallcaps} date time field:[^18]

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-50-ns}

![Example {{< fa clock >}} Wait configuration modal](configure_wait.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing an example Wait configuration modal" .screenshot group="wait"}
:::

::: {.w-40-ns}

![Example {{< fa clock >}} Wait step](example_wait.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing an example Wait step" .screenshot group="wait"}

:::

::::

#### {{< fa arrow-right-arrow-left >}} Run Workflow

In this example, the current workflow initiates another workflow called `On model validation`:

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-60-ns}

![Example {{< fa arrow-right-arrow-left >}} Run Workflow configuration modal](configure_run-workflow.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing an example Approval configuration modal" .screenshot group="run-workflow"}
:::

::: {.w-40-ns}

![Example {{< fa arrow-right-arrow-left >}} Run Workflow step](example_run-workflow.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing an example Approval step" .screenshot group="run-workflow"}

:::

::::

#### {{< fa circle-stop >}} End

:::: {.flex .flex-wrap .justify-around}

::: {.w-60-ns}
In this example, the workflow is designated to stop after running an additional workflow called `On model validation`:

:::

::: {.w-40-ns}

![Example {{< fa circle-stop >}} End step](example_end.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing an example End step" .screenshot}
