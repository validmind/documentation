### View tasks

Tasks are listed with the following information:

- The name of the model the workflow is attached to
- The current workflow state of the workflow[^8]
- The name of the workflow attached to the model[^9]
- The due date of the workflow, calculated from the workflow's expected duration
- Action items associated with that task

To show older tasks, scroll down to the bottom and click **Load More**.

### Access model details

To view the details of a model attached to a workflow task, click the button displaying the name of the model.

### Transition workflows

If an action is available to your role,[^10] you'll see it appear as an action button under a workflow task:

- Click **{{< fa arrow-right >}}** to open up the transition panel for your selected action. This arrow will be followed by the action name.
- Enter your **[notes]{.smallcaps}** and any other additional inventory fields[^11] then click **Submit**.

Once completed, tasks will be removed from your view.
