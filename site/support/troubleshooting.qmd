## SSL verification errors when initializing the {{< var validmind.developer >}}

```bash
HTTPSConnectionPool: SSL_VERIFY_FAILED: Certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate

### Fix

This error indicates a Certificate Authority issue. In rare cases it can signal an active man-in-the-middle attack. More often it reflects a corporate HTTPS proxy and firewall that intercept the connection while your local Python environment lacks the required certificate bundle.

Contact your internal IT team. Provide details about your Python environment and ask for help installing the correct CA bundle.
