ValidMind Developer Framework <span id="developer-framework">
: ValidMind's set of tools, guidelines, and standards designed to provide developers with a structured approach to documenting risk models. Includes our Python library, API endpoints, and other software components that simplify the model development process. Also see [ValidMind Platform](#platform).

ValidMind Platform <span id="platform">
: ValidMind's hosted multi-tenant architecture that includes the cloud-based web interface, APIs, databases, documentation and validation engine, and various internal services. Also see [Developer Framework](#developer-framework).

model developer
: Responsible for developing, implementing, and maintaining risk models. Model developers are typically subject matter experts in their domain and are responsible for ensuring that the model is fit-for-purpose, accurate, and aligned with the business requirements. Model developers collaborate with model validators and business units to ensure that models are conceptually sound, robust, and fit for their intended purpose, ultimately contributing to effective Model Risk Management and reliable decision-making.

model inventory
: A comprehensive documentation of all models used by an organization, their purpose, and their associated risks, essential for effective MRM.

model risk management (MRM)
: The process of identifying, assessing, and controlling risks associated with models used in financial institutions. Governance and risk management functions oversee the MRM process and ensure compliance with policies. 

model risk
: The potential for financial loss, incorrect decisions or unintended consequences resulting from errors or inaccuracies in financial models.

model governance
: The policies, procedures, and controls put in place by financial institutions to manage and monitor the use of models.

model validation 
: The process of evaluating and testing models to ensure that they are accurate, reliable, and effective with the help of our  platform.

model validator
: Responsible for the independent evaluation of a model's conceptual soundness, performance, and compliance with regulatory requirements. Their role is to ensure the model's assumptions, methodologies, and data quality are appropriate, and that the model is fit for its intended use. Model validators collaborate with business units and model developers to identify and address potential issues, ultimately helping to minimize model risk and enhance the reliability of model-driven decisions.

monitoring
: The regular evaluation of model performance, assumptions, and limitations to identify and address potential issues before they become significant risks.

three lines of defense
: A structured approach to MRM, consisting of 1) business units responsible for model development, validation, and implementation; 2) an independent model risk oversight function that provides a governance framework and guidance; and 3) the internal audit function, which assesses the effectiveness of MRM practices and controls.
